<p>Back Wrapper: NIKOLA TESLA a Serbian-American Engineer  
(10 July 1856 &ndash; 7 January 1943)
</p>
<p>Nikola Tesla made breakthroughs in the production, transmission and application of electric power.  He 
invented the first alternating current (AC) motor and developed AC generation and transmission technology. 
In 1884, he was hired by Edison (discoverer of DC dynamos) later on Tesla became his competitor in this field.
</p>
<p>Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge 
tubes, and early X &ndash; ray imaging. Tesla in 1890 itself conducted research for wireless lighting and worldwide 
wireless electric power distribution in his high &ndash; voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York. 
Unfortunately Tesla could not put his ideas in practical use due to lack of funds.

<p>INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>Electromagnetism is one of the most 
important branches of physics. The 
technological developments of the modern 
21st century are primarily due to our 
understanding of electromagnetism. The 
forces we experience in everyday life are 
electromagnetic in nature except gravity. 
</p>
<p>In standard XI, we studied about the 
gravitational force, tension, friction, normal 
force etc. Newton treated them to be 
independent of each other with each force 
being a separate natural force. But what is the 
origin of all these forces? It is now understood 
that except gravity, all forces which we 
experience in every day life (tension in the 
string, normal force from the surface, friction 
etc.) arise from electromagnetic forces within 
the atoms. Some examples are

<p>after rubbing with animal fur attracted 
small pieces of leaves and dust. The amber 
possessing this property is said to be 
&lsquo;charged&rsquo;. It was initially thought that amber 
has this special property. Later people found 
that not only amber but even a glass rod 
rubbed with silk cloth, attracts pieces of 
papers. So glass rod also becomes &lsquo;charged&rsquo; 
when rubbed with a suitable material.
</p>
<p>Consider a charged rubber rod hanging 
from a thread as shown in Figure 1.1. Suppose 
another charged rubber rod is brought near 
the first rubber rod; the rods repel each other. 
Now if we bring a charged glass rod close to 
the charged rubber rod, they attract each 
other. At the same time, if a charged glass rod 
is brought near another charged glass rod, 
both the rods repel each other. 
</p>
<p>From these observations, the following 
inferences are made
(i) The charging of rubber rod and that of 
</p>
<p>glass rod are different from one another.
(ii) The charged rubber rod repels another 
</p>
<p>charged rubber rod, which implies 
that &lsquo;like charges repel each other&rsquo;. We 
can also arrive at the same inference 
by observing that a charged glass rod 
repels another charged glass rod.
</p>
<p>(iii) The charged rubber rod attracts the 
charged glass rod, implying that the 
charge in the glass rod is not the same 
kind of charge present in the rubber. 
Thus unlike charges attract each other.
</p>
<p>Therefore, two kinds of charges exist  
in the universe. In the 18th century, Benjamin 
Franklin called one type of charge as  
positive (+) and another type of charge as 
negative (&ndash;). Based on Franklin&rsquo;s convention, 
rubber and amber rods are negatively 
charged while the glass rod is positively 
charged. If the net charge is zero in the 
object, it is said to be electrically neutral.
</p>
<p>(i) When an object is pushed, the atoms 
in our hand interact with the atoms in 
the object and this interaction is basically 
electromagnetic in nature.
</p>
<p>(ii) When we stand on Earth's surface, the 
gravitational force on us acts downwards 
and the normal force acts upward to counter 
balance the gravitational force. What is the 
origin of this normal force? 
</p>
<p> It arises due to the electromagnetic 
interaction of atoms on the surface of the 
Earth with the atoms present in the feet of 
the person. Though, we are attracted by the 
gravitational force of the Earth, we stand on 
Earth only because of electromagnetic force 
of atoms. 
</p>
<p>(iii) When an object is moved on a surface, 
static friction resists the motion of the 
object. This static friction arises due to 
electromagnetic interaction between the 
atoms present in the object and atoms on 
the surface. Kinetic friction also has similar 
origin.
</p>
<p>From these examples, it is clear that 
understanding electromagnetism is very 
essential to understand the universe in 
a holistic manner. The basic principles 
of electromagnetism are dealt with 
in volume 1 at XII standard physics.  
This unit deals with the behaviour and other 
related phenomena of charges at rest. This 
branch of electricity which deals with 
stationary charges is called Electrostatics.
</p>

of electric charges

<p>Two millenniums ago, Greeks noticed 
that amber (a solid, translucent material 
formed from the resin of a fossilized tree)

<p>is another intrinsic and fundamental 
property of particles. The nature of charges 
is understood through various experiments 
performed in the 19th and 20th century. The 
SI unit of charge is coulomb.
</p>
<p>(ii) Conservation of charges
Benjamin Franklin argued that when one 
</p>
<p>object is rubbed with another object, charges 
get transferred from one to the other. Before 
rubbing, both objects are electrically neutral 
and rubbing simply transfers the charges 
from one object to the other. (For example, 
when a glass rod is rubbed against silk cloth, 
some negative charge are transferred from 
glass to silk. As a result, the glass rod is 
positively charged and silk cloth becomes 
negatively charged). 
</p>
<p>From these observations, he concluded 
that charges are neither created or nor 
destroyed but can only be transferred 
from one object to other. This is called 
conservation of total charges and is one of the 
fundamental conservation laws in physics. It 
is stated more generally in the following way.
</p>
<p>The total electric charge in the universe 
is constant and charge can neither be 
created nor be destroyed. In any physical 
</p>
<p>Following the pioneering work of 
J. J. Thomson and E. Rutherford, in the late 
19th century and in the beginning of 20th 
century, we now understand that the atom 
is electrically neutral and is made up of 
the negatively charged electrons, positively 
charged protons, and neutrons which have 
zero charge. The material objects made 
up of atoms are neutral in general. When 
an object is rubbed with another object 
(for example rubber with silk cloth), some 
amount of charge is transferred from 
one object to another due to the friction 
between them and the object is then 
said to be electrically charged. Charging 
the objects through rubbing is called 
triboelectric charging.
</p>
<p>1.1.2 Basic properties of 
charges

Most objects in the universe are made

<p>COULOMB&rsquo;S LAW
</p>
<p>In the year 1786, Coulomb deduced 
the expression for the force between two 
stationary point charges in vacuum or 
free space. Consider two point charges q1 
and q2 at rest in vacuum, and separated 
by a distance of r as shown in Figure 1.2. 
According to Coulomb, the force on the 
point charge q2 exerted by another point 
charge q1 is

proportionality constant.

<p>Figure 1.2 Coulomb force between two 
positive point charges
</p>
<p>Important aspects of Coulomb&rsquo;s law
(i) Coulomb's law states that the electrostatic 
force is directly proportional to the product of 
the magnitude of the two point charges and 
is inversely proportional to the square of the 
distance between the two point charges.
</p>
<p>(ii) The force on the charge q2 exerted 
by the charge q1 always lies along the line 
</p>
<p>process, the net change in charge will 
always be zero. 
</p>
<p>(iii) Quantisation of charges
What is the smallest amount of charge 
</p>
<p>that can be found in nature? Experiments 
show that the charge on an electron is &minus;e 
and the charge on the proton is +e. Here, e 
denotes the fundamental unit of charge. The 
charge q on any object is equal to an integral 
multiple of this fundamental unit of charge e.
</p>
<p>q = ne (1.1)
</p>
<p>Here n is any integer (0, &plusmn;1, &plusmn;2, &plusmn;3, 
&plusmn;4&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..). This is called quantisation of 
electric charge.
</p>
<p>Robert Millikan in his famous experiment 
found that the value of e = 1.6 &times; 10&ndash;19 C. The 
charge of an electron is &minus;1.6 &times; 10&ndash;19 C and 
the charge of the proton is +1.6 &times; 10&ndash;19 C.
When a glass rod is rubbed with silk cloth, 
the number of charges transferred is usually 
very large, typically of the order of 1010. So 
the charge quantisation is not appreciable 
at the macroscopic level. Hence the charges 
are treated to be continuous (not discrete). 
But at the microscopic level, quantisation of 
charge plays a vital role.
</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 1.1
</p>
<p>Calculate the number of electrons in one 
coulomb of negative charge.
</p>
<p>Solution
</p>
<p>According to the quantisation of charge,
</p>
<p>q = ne
</p>
<p>Here q = 1C.  So the number of electrons in 
1 coulomb of charge is

<p>Unit 1  Electrostatics 5
</p>
<p>(vi) Coulomb&rsquo;s law has same structure 
as Newton&rsquo;s law of gravitation. Both are 
inversely proportional to the square of 
the distance between the particles. The 
electrostatic force is directly proportional 
to the product of the magnitude of  
two point charges and gravitational force 
is directly proportional to the product  
of two masses. But there are some 
important differences between these two 
laws. 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 The gravitational force between two 
masses is always attractive but Coulomb 
force between two charges can be attractive 
or repulsive, depending on the nature of 
charges. 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 The value of the gravitational constant 
G = 6.67 &times; 10&ndash;11 N m2 kg&ndash;2. The value  
of the constant k in Coulomb law is  
k = 9 &times; 109 N m2 C&ndash;2. Since k is much 
more greater than G, the electrostatic 
force is always greater in magnitude than 
gravitational force for smaller size objects.
&bull;	 The gravitational force between two 
masses is independent of the medium. For 
example, if 1 kg of two masses are kept in 
air or inside water, the gravitational force 
between two masses remains the same. 
But the electrostatic force between the two 
charges depends on nature of the medium 
in which the two charges are kept at rest.

the direction opposite to r12 ).

of the order of &micro;C (micro coulomb) or nC

<p>(viii) The expression for Coulomb force 
is true only for point charges. But the point 
charge is an ideal concept. However we 
can apply Coulomb&rsquo;s law for two charged 
objects whose sizes are very much smaller 
than the distance between them. In fact, 
Coulomb discovered his law by considering 
the charged spheres in the torsion balance 
as point charges. The distance between the 
two charged spheres is much greater than the 
radii of the spheres.

<p>1.2.1 Superposition principle
</p>
<p>Coulomb&rsquo;s law explains the interaction 
between two point charges. If there are 
more than two charges, the force on one 
charge due to all the other charges needs 
to be calculated. Coulomb&rsquo;s law alone does 
not give the answer. The superposition 
principle explains the interaction between 
multiple charges. 
</p>
<p>According to this superposition 
principle, the total force acting on a given 
charge is equal to the vector sum of forces 
exerted on it by all the other charges. 
</p>
<p>Consider a system of n charges, namely 
q1, q2, q3 &hellip;.qn. The force on q1 exerted by the 
charge q2

<p>where r21 is the unit vector from q2 to q1 
along the line joining the two charges and 
r21  is the distance between the charges q1 
and q2. The electrostatic force between two 
charges is not affected by the presence of 
other charges in the  neighbourhood.

<p>The electrostatic force between a proton 
and an electron is enormously greater 
than the gravitational force between them. 
Thus the gravitational force is negligible 
when compared with the electrostatic force 
in many situations such as for small size 
objects and in the atomic domain. This is 
the reason why a charged comb attracts an 
uncharged piece of paper with 
greater force even though the 
piece of paper is attracted 
downward by the Earth. This 
is shown in Figure 1.3

ELECTRIC FIELD AND 
ELECTRIC FIELD LINES
</p>
<p>1.3.1 Electric Field
</p>
<p>The interaction between two charges is 
determined by Coulomb&rsquo;s law. How does 
the interaction itself occur? Consider a point 
charge kept at a point in space. If another 
point charge is placed at some distance from 
the first point charge, it experiences either 
an attractive force or repulsive force. This is 
called &lsquo;action at a distance&rsquo;. But how does the 
second charge know about existence of the 
first charge which is located at some distance 
away from it? To answer this question, Michael 
Faraday introduced the concept of field.
</p>
<p>According to Faraday, every charge in 
the universe creates an electric field in the 
surrounding space, and if another charge 
is brought into its field, it will interact 
with the electric field at that point and will 
experience a force. It may be recalled that 
the interaction of two masses is similarly 
explained using the concept of gravitational 
field (Refer unit 6, volume 2, XI physics). 
Both the electric and gravitational forces are 
non-contact forces, hence the field concept 
is required to explain action at a distance.
</p>
<p>Consider a source point charge q located 
at a point in space. Another point charge qo 
</p>
<p>(test charge) is placed at some point P which 
is at a distance r from the charge q. The 
electrostatic force experienced by the charge 
qo due to q is given by Coulomb&rsquo;s law.

(iv) Since the electric field is a vector 
quantity, at every point in space, this field 
has unique direction and magnitude as 
shown in Figures 1.6(a) and (b). From 
equation (1.4), we can infer that as distance 
increases, the electric field decreases in 
magnitude.

<p>Note that in Figures 1.6 (a) and (b) the 
length of the electric field vector is shown

Important aspects of Electric field
(i) If the charge q is positive then the electric 
field points away from the source charge and 
if q is negative, the electric field points towards 
the source charge q. This is shown in the 
Figure 1.4.

<p>(vii) There are two kinds of the electric 
field: uniform (constant) electric field 
and non-uniform electric field. Uniform 
electric field will have the same direction 
and constant magnitude at all points in 
space. Non-uniform electric field will 
have different directions or different 
magnitudes or both at different points 
in space. The electric field created by a 
point charge is basically a non uniform 
electric field. This non-uniformity arises, 
both in direction and magnitude, with 
the direction being radially outward (or 
inward) and the magnitude changes as 
distance increases. These are shown in 
Figure 1.7.

<p>(v) In the definition of electric field, 
it is assumed that the test charge q0 is 
taken sufficiently small, so that bringing 
this test charge will not move the source 
charge. In other words, the test charge is 
made sufficiently small such that it will 
not modify the electric field of the source 
charge.
(vi) The expression (1.4) is valid only for 
point charges. For continuous and finite size 
charge distributions, integration techniques 
must be used (Refer Appendix A1.1). 
However, this expression can be used as an 
approximation for a finite-sized charge if 
the test point is very far away from the finite 
sized source charge. Note that we similarly 
treat the Earth as a point mass when we 
calculate the gravitational field of the Sun 
on the Earth (Refer unit 6, volume 2, XI 
physics).

<p>1.3.2 Electric field due to the 
system of point charges
</p>
<p>Suppose a number of point charges are 
distributed in space. To find the electric field 
at some point P due to this collection of point 
charges, superposition principle is used. The 
electric field at an arbitrary point due to a 
collection of point charges is simply equal to 
the vector sum of the electric fields created 
by the individual point charges. This is 
called superposition of electric fields.
</p>
<p>Consider a collection of point charges 
q q n1 2 3, , ..........q q  located at various points in 
space. The total electric field at some point 
P due to all these n charges is given by

<p>field due to a charged sphere or a charged 
wire etc., it is very difficult to look at 
individual charges in these charged 
bodies. Therefore, it is assumed that 
charge is distributed continuously on the 
charged bodies and the discrete nature 
of charges is not considered here. The 
electric field due to such continuous 
charge distributions is found by invoking 
the method of calculus. (For further 
reading, refer Appendix A1.1).

followed while drawing electric field lines 
for charges.
&bull;	 The electric field lines start from 
a positive charge and end at negative 
charges or at infinity. For a positive point 
charge the electric field lines point radially 
outward and for a negative point charge, 
the electric field lines point radially 
inward. These are shown in Figure 1.9 (a)

<p>The electric dipole moment vector lies along 
the line joining two charges and is directed 
from &ndash;q to +q. The SI unit of dipole moment is 
coulomb metre (Cm). The electric field lines for 
an electric dipole are shown in Figure 1.14 (b).
&bull;	 For simplicity, the two charges are 
placed on the x-axis. Even if the two charges 
are placed on y or z-axis, dipole moment will 
point from &ndash;q to +q.

</p>
<p>(i) The electric field lines start at q2 and 
end at q1. In figure (a), q2 is positive and q1 
</p>
<p>is negative. The number of lines starting 
from q2 is 18 and number of the lines ending 
at q1 is 6. So q2 has greater magnitude. The

<p>(ii) In figure (b), the number of field 
lines emanating from both positive charges 
are equal (N=18). So the charges are equal. 
At point A, the electric field lines are 
denser compared to the lines at point B. 
So the electric field at point A is greater in 
magnitude compared to the field at point 
B. Further, no electric field line passes 
through C, which implies that the resultant 
electric field at C due to these two charges 
is zero.
(iii) In the figure (c), the electric field 
lines start at q1 and q3 and end at q2. This 
implies that q1 and q3 are positive charges.

</p>
<p>From both cases (a) and (b), we can 
infer that in general the electric dipole 
moment depends on the choice of the 
origin and charge configuration. But 
for one special case, the electric dipole 
moment is independent of the origin. If the 
total charge is zero, then the electric dipole 
moment will be the same irrespective of 
the choice of the origin. It is because of this 
reason that the electric dipole moment of 
an electric dipole (total charge is zero) is 
always directed from &ndash;q to +q, independent 
of the choice of the origin.

<p>The water molecule (H2O) has this 
charge configuration. The water molecule 
has three atoms (two H atom and one O 
atom). The centres of positive (H) and 
negative (O) charges of a water molecule 
lie at different points, hence it possess 
permanent dipole moment. The electric 
dipole moment p  is directed from centre 
of negative charge to the centre of positive 
charge, as shown in the figure.

<p>&bull;	 Though the electric dipole moment for 
two equal and opposite charges is defined,

<p>Solution
Case (a) The position vector for the +q on 
the positive x-axis is aiand position vector 
for the +q charge the negative x axis is -ai .  
So the dipole moment is,

</p>
<p>Case (b) In this case one charge is placed 
at the origin, so its position vector is zero.  
Hence only the second charge +q with 
position vector aicontributes to the dipole 
moment, which is p qai= .

<p>Important inferences
(i) From equations (1.17) and (1.21), it 
is inferred that for very large distances, the 
magnitude of the electric field at point on 
the dipole axis is twice the magnitude of the 
electric field at the point at the same distance 
on the equatorial plane. The direction of the 
electric field at points on the dipole axis is 
directed along the direction of dipole moment 
vector p  but at points on the equatorial plane 
it is directed opposite to the dipole moment 
vector, that is along -p .
(ii) At very large distances, the electric 
</p>
<p>field due to a dipole varies as 1
3r
</p>
<p>. Note 
</p>
<p>that for a point charge, the electric field 
</p>
<p>of 

</p>
<p>E+  is along BC and the direction of 

</p>
<p>E- is 
along CA. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>E+  and 

</p>
<p>E-  can be resolved into 
two components; one component parallel to 
the dipole axis and the other perpendicular 
to it. Since perpendicular components 

</p>
<p>E+ sinθ  and 

</p>
<p>E- sinθ  are eqaul in magnitude 
and oppositely directed, they cancel each 
other. The magnitude of the total electric 
field at point C is the sum of the parallel 
components of 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>E+ and 

</p>
<p>E- and its direction

<p>Using right-hand corkscrew rule (Refer 
XI, volume 1, unit 2), it is found that total 
torque is perpendicular to the plane of the 
paper and is directed into it.

<p>τ θ= &sdot;qE a2 sin  (1.23)
</p>
<p>where θ is the angle made by p  with 

</p>
<p>E . 
Since p = 2aq, the torque is written in terms 
of the vector product as
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>τ= &times;p E  (1.24)
</p>
<p>The magnitude of this torque is 
τ θ= pE sin  and is maximum when θ = 90 .
</p>
<p>This torque tends to rotate the dipole 
and align it with the electric field 
</p>

</p>
<p>E . Once 

</p>
<p>p is aligned with 

</p>
<p>E , the total torque on the 
dipole becomes zero.
</p>
<p>If the electric field is not uniform, then 
the force experienced by +q is different from 
that experienced by &ndash;q. In addition to the 
torque, there will be net force acting on the 
dipole. This is shown in Figure 1.19.
</p>
<p>varies as 1

</p>
<p>.  This implies that the electric 
</p>
<p>field due to a dipole at very large distances 
goes to zero faster than the electric field 
due to a point charge. The reason for this 
behavior is that at very large distance, the 
two charges appear to be close to each 
other and neutralize each other.
(iii) The equations (1.17) and (1.21) 
are valid only at very large distances 
(r&gt;&gt;a). Suppose the distance  
2a approaches zero and q approaches 
infinity such that the product of  
2aq = p is finite, then the dipole is called 
a point dipole. For such point dipoles, 
equations (1.17) and (1.21) are exact and 
hold true for any r.

</p>
<p>E  is uniform, the total force acting 
on the dipole is zero. These two forces 
acting at different points will constitute 
a couple and the dipole experience a 
torque as shown in Figure 1.18. This 
torque tends to rotate the dipole. (Note 
that electric field lines of a uniform field 
are equally spaced and point in the same 
direction).

ELECTROSTATIC 
POTENTIAL AND 
POTENTIAL ENERGY
</p>
<p>Introduction
In mechanics, potential energy is 
</p>
<p>defined for conservative forces. Since 
gravitational force is a conservative 
force, its gravitational potential energy 
is defined in XI standard physics (Unit 
6). Since Coulomb force is an inverse-
square-law force, its also a conservative 
force like gravitational force. Therefore, 
we can define potential energy for charge 
configurations.
</p>
<p>1.5.1 Electrostatic Potential 
energy and Electrostatic 
potential
</p>
<p>Consider a positive charge q kept fixed 
at the origin which produces an electric 
field 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>E  around it. A positive test charge q&prime; is 
brought from point R to point P against the 
repulsive force between q and q&prime; as shown in 
Figure 1.20. Work must be done to overcome 
the repulsion between the charges and this 
work done is stored as potential energy of 
the system.

<p>EXAMPLE 1.11
</p>
<p>A sample of HCl gas is placed in  
a uniform electric field of magnitude  
3 &times; 104 N C&ndash;1. The dipole moment of each 
HCl molecule is 3.4 &times; 10&ndash;30 Cm. Calculate 
the maximum torque experienced by 
each HCl molecule.
</p>
<p>Solution
The maximum torque experienced 
</p>
<p>by the dipole is when it is aligned 
perpendicular to the applied field.

<p>Microwave oven works on the principle of 
torque acting on an electric dipole. The food 
we consume has water molecules which are 
permanent electric dipoles. Oven produces 
</p>
<p>microwaves that are oscillating electromagnetic fields and 
produce torque on the water molecules. Due to this torque 
on each water molecule, the molecules rotate very fast and 
produce thermal energy.  Thus, heat generated is used to 
heat the food.

<p>  is called 
</p>
<p>electric potential difference between P and 
R and is denoted as VP &ndash; VR = ∆V. 
</p>

<p>The electric potential energy difference 
can be written as ∆U = q&prime; ∆V. Physically 
potential difference between two points 
is a meaningful quantity.  The value of 
the potential itself at one point is not 
meaningful. Therefore the point R is taken 
to infinity and the potential at infinity is 
considered as zero V&infin; =( )0 . 
</p>
<p>Then the electric potential at a point P is 
equal to the work done by an external force 
to bring a unit positive charge with constant 
velocity from infinity to the point P in 
the region of the external electric field 
</p>

<p>Important points
1. Electric potential at point P depends 
</p>
<p>only on the electric field which is due 
to the source charge q and not on the 
test charge q&prime;. Unit positive charge is 
brought from infinity to the point P 
with constant velocity because external 
agency should not impart any kinetic 
energy to the test charge.

</p>
<p>The test charge q&prime; is brought from R to 
P with constant velocity which means that

it depends only on the initial and final

energy associated with q&prime; at P is UP and that 
at R is UR, then difference in potential energy

called an equipotential surface.

<p>An equipotential surface is a surface 
on which all the points are at the same electric 
potential. For a point charge the equipotential 
surfaces are concentric spherical surfaces 
as shown in Figure 1.26(b). Each spherical

(i) The work done to move a charge 
q between any two points A and B,  
W = q (VB &ndash; VA). If the points A and B lie on 
the same equipotential surface, work done is 
zero because VA = VB.
(ii) The electric field is normal to an 
equipotential surface. If it is not normal, 
then there is a component of the field 
parallel to the surface. Then work must 
be done to move a charge between two 
points on the same surface. This is a 
contradiction. Therefore the electric field 
must always be normal to equipotential 
surface.

electric field and potential
</p>
<p>Consider a positive charge q kept fixed at 
the origin. To move a unit positive charge by a 
small distance dx towards q in the electric field 
E, the work done is given by dW = &minus;E dx. The 
minus sign implies that work is done against 
the electric field. This work done is equal to 
electric potential difference. Therefore,

<p>1.5.6 Electrostatic potential

</p>
<p>This potential V is the work done to 
bring a unit positive charge from infinity to 
the point. Now if the charge q2 is brought 
from infinity to that point at a distance r 
from q1, the work done is the product of q2 
and the electric potential at that point. Thus 
we have
</p>
<p>W q V= 2
</p>
<p>This work done is stored as the 
electrostatic potential energy U of a system 
of charges q1 and q2 separated by a distance 
r. Thus we have

<p> (1.45)
</p>
<p>The electrostatic potential energy 
depends only on the distance between the 
two point charges. In fact, the expression 
(1.45) is derived by assuming that q1 is fixed 
and q2 is brought from infinity. The equation 
(1.45) holds true when q2 is fixed and q1 is 
brought from infinity or both q1 and q2 are 
simultaneously brought from infinity to a 
distance r between them.
</p>
<p>Three charges are arranged in the following 
configuration as shown in Figure 1.28.
</p>
<p>To calculate the total electrostatic 
potential energy, we use the following 
procedure. We bring all the charges  
one by one and arrange them according  
to the configuration as shown in Figure 
1.28.

<p>Note that this stored potential energy

to assemble the three charges at the given 
locations. The expression (1.48) is same if 
the charges are brought to their positions

is a conservative force, the electrostatic 
potential energy is independent of the 
manner in which the configuration of 
charges is arrived at.

<p>(i) Bringing a charge q1 from infinity to 
the point A requires no work, because there 
are no other charges already present in the 
vicinity of charge q1. 
</p>
<p>(ii) To bring the second charge q2 to the 
point B, work must be done against the 
electric field created by the charge q1. So the 
work done on the charge q2 is W = q2 V1B. 
Here V1B is the electrostatic potential due to 
the charge q1 at point B.

<p>(iii) Similarly to bring the charge q3 to 
the point C, work has to be done against 
the total electric field due to both charges 
q1 and q2. So the work done to bring  
the charge q3 is = q3 (V1C + V2C). Here 
V1C is the electrostatic potential due to  
charge q1 at point C and V2C is the 
electrostatic potential due to charge q2 at

A dipole experiences a torque when kept 
in an uniform electric field 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>E . This torque 
rotates the dipole to align it with the 
direction of the electric field.  To rotate the 
dipole (at constant angular velocity) from 
its initial angle θ&prime; to another angle θ against 
the torque exerted by the electric field, an 
equal and opposite external torque must be 
applied on the dipole.

GAUSS LAW AND ITS 
APPLICATIONS
</p>
<p>1.6.1 Electric Flux
</p>
<p>The number of electric field lines 
crossing a given area kept normal to the 
electric field lines is called electric flux. 
It is usually denoted by the Greek letter 
ΦE  and its unit is N m2 C&ndash;1. Electric flux is 
a scalar quantity and it can be positive or 
negative. For a simpler understanding of 
electric flux, the following Figure 1.30 is 
useful.
</p>
<p>UNIT-1(XII-Physics_Vol-1).indd   36UNIT-1(XII-Physics_Vol-1).indd   36 23-12-2021   19:01:2523-12-2021   19:01:25

<p>Unit 1  Electrostatics 37
</p>
<p>Suppose the same area A is kept parallel 
to the uniform electric field, then no electric 
field lines pass through the area A , as shown 
in Figure 1.31(b). The electric flux for this 
case is zero.
</p>
<p>ΦE = 0  (1.53)
</p>
<p>If the area is inclined at an angle θ 
with the field, then the component of the 
electric field perpendicular to the area alone 
contributes to the electric flux. The electric 
field component parallel to the surface area 
will not contribute to the electric flux. This 
is shown in Figure 1.31 (c). For this case, the 
electric flux
</p>
<p>ΦE = (E cosθ) A (1.54)
</p>
<p>Further, θ is also the angle between 
the electric field and the direction normal  
to the area. Hence in general, for uniform 
electric field, the electric flux is defined  
as
</p>
<p>ΦE E A EA= &sdot; =
 
</p>
<p>cosθ  (1.55)
</p>
<p>Here, note that 

</p>
<p>A  is the area vector 

</p>
<p>A An= .  
Its magnitude is simply the area A and 
its direction is along the unit vector n  
perpendicular to the area as shown in Figure 
1.31. Using this definition for flux, ΦE E A= &sdot;
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>,  
equations (1.53) and (1.54) can be obtained  
as special cases.
</p>
<p>In Figure 1.31 (a), θ = 0o. Therefore, 
</p>
<p>ΦE E A EA= &sdot; =
 
</p>
<p>In Figure 1.31 (b), θ = 90o. Therefore,  
</p>
<p>ΦE E A= &sdot; =
 
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>The electric field of a point charge is 
drawn in this figure. Consider two small 
rectangular area elements placed normal to 
the field at regions A and B. Even though 
these elements have the same area, the 
number of electric field lines crossing 
the element in region A is more than that 
crossing the element in region B. Therfore 
the electric flux in region A is more than 
that in region B. Since electric field strength 
for a point charge decreases as the distance 
increases, electric flux also decreases as the 
distance increases. The above discussion 
gives a qualitative idea of electric flux. 
However a precise definition of electric flux 
is needed.  
</p>
<p>Electric flux for uniform Electric field
Consider a uniform electric field in a 
</p>
<p>region of space. Let us choose an area A 
normal to the electric field lines as shown 
in Figure 1.31 (a). The electric flux for this 
case is

<p>The total electric flux over this closed

� �

</p>
<p>Note the difference between equations 
(1.57) and (1.58). The integration in equation 
(1.58) is a closed surface integration and for 
each areal element, the outward normal is 
the direction of dA
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p> as shown in the Figure 
1.33(b).
</p>
<p>The total electric flux over a closed 
surface can be negative, positive or zero. In 
the Figure 1.33(b), it is shown that in one 
area element, the angle between dA
</p>
<p>

<p>E  is less than 90o, then the electric flux is 
positive and in another areal element, the 
angle between dA
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p> and 

</p>
<p>E  is greater than 90o, 
then the electric flux is negative. 
</p>
<p>In general, the electric flux is negative 
if the electric field lines enter the closed 
surface and positive if the electric field lines 
leave the closed surface.
</p>
<p>1.6.3 Gauss law
</p>
<p>A positive point charge Q is surrounded 
by an imaginary sphere of radius r as shown

<p>The electric field of the point charge is

</p>

</p>
<p>From Equation (1.57), it is clear that the 
electric flux for a given surface depends on 
both the electric field pattern on the surface 
area and orientation of the surface with 
respect to the electric field.

<p>1.6.2 Electric flux for closed

<p>In the previous section, the electric flux 
for any arbitrary curved surface is discussed. 
Suppose a closed surface is present in the

<p>Discussion of Gauss law
(i) The total electric flux through 
the closed surface depends only on the 
charges enclosed by the surface and the 
charges present outside the surface will 
not contribute to the flux and the shape 
of the closed surface which can be chosen 
arbitrarily. 
</p>
<p>(ii) The total electric flux is independent of 
the location of the charges inside the closed 
surface.

that the equation (1.61) is equally true for 
any arbitrary shaped surface which encloses

the same for closed surfaces A1, A2 and A3 as

<p>charge Q. So electric flux through this

<p>closed surface A1 is Q
e

</p>
<p>. But the closed 
</p>
<p>surface A2 contains no charges inside, so 
electric flux through A2 is zero.
</p>
<p>(ii) In figure (b), the net charge inside the 
cube is 3q and the total electric flux in the 
</p>
<p>cube is therefore ΦE

will not contribute the total flux through 
the surface of the cube.

<p>1.6.4 Applications of Gauss law
</p>
<p>Electric field due to any arbitrary charge 
configuration can be calculated using 
Coulomb&rsquo;s law or Gauss law. If the charge 
configuration possesses some kind of 
symmetry, then Gauss law is a very efficient 
way to calculate the electric field. It is 
illustrated in the following cases.
(i)  Electric field due to an infinitely long 
</p>
<p>charged wire
Consider an infinitely long straight 
</p>
<p>wire having uniform linear charge density 
λ(charge per unit length). Let P be a point 
located at a perpendicular distance r from 
the wire (Figure 1.36(a)). The electric field 
at the point P can be found using Gauss law. 
</p>
<p>We choose two small charge elements 
A1 and A2 on the wire which are at equal 
distances from the point P. The resultant 
electric field due to these two charge 
elements points radially away from the 
charged wire and the magnitude of electric 
field is same at all points on the circle 
of radius r. This is shown in the Figure 
1.36(b). Since the charged wire possesses 
</p>
<p>(iii) To arrive at equation (1.62), we have 
chosen a spherical surface. This imaginary 
surface is called a Gaussian surface. The 
shape of the Gaussian surface to be chosen 
depends on the type of charge configuration 
and the kind of symmetry existing in that 
charge configuration. The electric field is 
spherically symmetric for a point charge, 
therefore spherical Gaussian surface is 
chosen. Cylindrical and planar Gaussian 
surfaces can be chosen for other kinds of 
charge configurations.
</p>
<p>(iv) In the LHS of equation (1.62),  
the electric field 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>E  is due to charges 
present inside and outside the Gaussian 
surface but the charge Qencl denotes the 
charges which lie only inside the Gaussian 
surface.

<p>At the points P2 and P3, the electric field 
due to both plates are equal in magnitude 
and opposite in direction (Figure 1.39). As 
a result, electric field at a point outside the

<p>(iv) Electric field due to a uniformly

</p>
<p>Consider a uniformly charged spherical 
shell of radius R carrying total charge Q as 
shown in Figure 1.40. The electric field at 
points outside and inside the sphere can be 
found using Gauss law.

<p>Case (a) At a point outside the shell (r &gt; R)
Let us choose a point P outside the shell 
</p>
<p>at a distance r from the centre as shown in 
Figure 1.40 (a). The charge is uniformly 
distributed on the surface of the sphere 
(spherical symmetry). Hence the electric 
field must point radially outward if Q &gt; 0 and 
point radially inward if Q &lt; 0. So a&nbsp;spherical 
Gaussian surface of radius r is chosen and

<p>The electric field will be the same at any 
point farther away from the charged plane. 
Equation (1.71) implies that if σ &gt; 0 the 
electric field at any point P is along outward 
perpendicular n  drawn to the plane and 
if σ &lt; 0, the electric field points inward 
perpendicularly to the plane (-n ).

<p>For a finite charged plane sheet, equation 
(1.71) is approximately true only in the 
middle region of the plane and at points far 
away from both ends.

to move in the material. In a metallic 
conductor, these mobile charges are free 
electrons which are not bound to any 
atom and therefore are free to move on the 
surface of the conductor. When there is no 
external electric field, the free electrons 
are in continuous random motion in all 
directions. As a result, there is no net 
motion of electrons along any particular 
direction which implies that the conductor 
is in electrostatic equilibrium. Thus at 
electrostatic equilibrium, there is no net 
current in the conductor. A conductor at 
electrostatic equilibrium has the following 
properties.
</p>
<p>(i) The electric field is zero everywhere 
inside the conductor. This is true 
regardless of whether the conductor is 
solid or hollow.
</p>
<p>This is an experimental fact. Suppose 
the electric field is not zero inside the 
metal, then there will be a force on the 
mobile charge carriers due to this electric 
field. As a result, there will be a net motion 
of the mobile charges, which contradicts 
the conductors being in electrostatic 
equilibrium. Thus the electric field is 
zero everywhere inside the conductor. We 
can also understand this fact by applying 
an external uniform electric field on the 
conductor. This is shown in Figure 1.42.

<p>Gauss law is a powerful 
technique whenever a given 
charge configuration possesses 
</p>
<p>spherical, cylindrical or planar symmetry, 
then the electric field due to such a charge 
configuration can be easily found. If there 
is no such symmetry, the direct method 
(Coulomb&rsquo;s law and calculus) can be used. 
For example, it is difficult to use Gauss law to 
find the electric field for a dipole since it has 
no spherical, cylindrical or planar symmetry.

<p>Figure 1.42 Electric field of conductors
</p>
<p>Before applying the external electric 
field, the free electrons in the conductor are 
uniformly distributed in the conductor. When 
an electric field is applied, the free electrons 
accelerate to the left causing the left plate to 
be negatively charged and the right plate to be 
positively charged as shown in Figure 1.42. 
</p>
<p>Due to this realignment of free 
electrons, there will be an internal electric 
field created inside the conductor which 
increases until it nullifies the external 
electric field. Once the external electric 
field is nullified the conductor is said to 
be in electrostatic equilibrium. The time 
taken by a conductor to reach electrostatic 
equilibrium is in the order of 10&ndash;16s, which 
can be taken as almost instantaneous.
(ii) There is no net charge inside the 
conductors. The charges must reside only 
on the surface of the conductors.
</p>
<p>We can prove this property using 
Gauss law. Consider an arbitrarily shaped 
conductor as shown in Figure&nbsp;1.43.
</p>
<p>A Gaussian surface is drawn inside the 
conductor such that it is very close to the 
surface of the conductor. Since the electric 
field is zero everywhere inside the conductor, 
the net electric flux is also zero over this 
Gaussian surface. From Gauss&rsquo;s law, this 
implies that there is no net charge inside the 
conductor. Even if some charge is introduced

<p>where n represents the unit vector outward

Suppose σ &lt; 0, then electric field points 
inward perpendicular to the surface.
(iv) The electrostatic potential has the 
same value on the surface and inside of the 
conductor.
</p>
<p>We know that the conductor has no 
parallel electric component on the surface 
which means that charges can be moved on 
the surface without doing any work. This is 
possible only if the electrostatic potential 
is constant at all points on the surface and 
there is no potential difference between any 
two points on the surface. 
</p>
<p>Since the electric field is zero inside 
the conductor, the potential is the same 
as the surface of the conductor. Thus at 
electrostatic equilibrium, the conductor is 
always at equipotential.
</p>
<p>1.7.2 Electrostatic shielding
</p>
<p>Using Gauss law, we can prove that the 
electric field inside the charged spherical shell 
is zero, Further, we can show that the electric 
field inside both hollow and solid conductors 
is zero. It is a very interesting property which 
has an important consequence. 
</p>
<p>Consider a cavity inside the conductor 
as shown in Figure 1.46 (a). Whatever be 
the charges at the surfaces and whatever 
be the electrical disturbances outside, the 
electric field inside the cavity is zero.  A 
sensitive electrical instrument which is 
to be protected from external electrical 
disturbance can be kept inside this cavity. 
This is called electrostatic shielding. 
</p>
<p>conductor is not in equilibrium. Therefore 
at electrostatic equilibrium, the electric 
field must be perpendicular to the surface 
of the conductor. This is shown in Figure 
1.44 (b).
</p>
<p>We now prove that the electric field has

<p> just outside the conductor&rsquo;s

Gaussian surface, as shown in the Figure

inside the conductor.

<p>Since electric field is normal to the 
surface of the conductor, the curved part 
of the cylinder has zero electric flux. Also 
inside the conductor, the electric field is zero. 
Hence the bottom flat part of the Gaussian 
surface has no electric flux. 
</p>
<p>Therefore the top flat surface alone 
contributes to the electric flux. The electric

<p>rod is touched by another conductor, 
charges start to flow from charged rod 
to the conductor. Is it possible to charge 
a conductor without any contact? The 
answer is yes. This type of charging 
without actual contact is called 
electrostatic induction. 
</p>
<p>(i) Consider an uncharged (neutral) 
conducting sphere at rest on an insulating 
stand. Suppose a negatively charged rod 
is brought near the conductor without 
touching it, as shown in Figure 1.47(a).
</p>
<p>The negative charge of the rod repels the 
electrons in the conductor to the opposite 
side. As a result, positive charges are induced 
near the region of the charged rod while 
negative charges on the farther side. 
</p>
<p>Before introducing the charged rod, the 
free electrons were distributed uniformly 
on the surface of the conductor and the 
net charge is zero. Once the charged rod is 
brought near the conductor, the distribution 
is no longer uniform with more electrons 
located on the farther side of the rod and 
positive charges are located closer to the 
rod. But the total charge is zero.
</p>
<p>Faraday cage is an instrument used 
to demonstrate this effect. It is made up 
of metal bars as shown in Figure1.46 (b).  
If an artificial lightning jolt is created 
outside, the person inside is not affected.
</p>
<p>During lightning accompanied by a 
thunderstorm, it is always safer to sit inside a 
bus than in open ground or under a tree. The 
metal body of the bus provides electrostatic 
shielding, since the electric field inside is 
zero. During lightning, the charges flow 
through the body of the conductor to the 
ground with no effect on the person inside 
that bus.

<p>Solution
</p>
<p>If the conductor has no net charge, then 
its motion is the same as usual projectile 
motion of a mass m which we studied in 
Kinematics (unit 2, vol-1 XI physics). 
Here, in this problem, in addition to 
downward gravitational force, the charge 
also will experience a downward uniform 
electrostatic force.

</p>
<p>It is important here to note that the 
acceleration depends on the mass of the 
object. Galileo&rsquo;s conclusion that all objects 
fall at the same rate towards the Earth is 
true only in a uniform gravitational field. 
When a uniform electric field is included, 
the acceleration of a charged object 
depends on both mass and charge.

</p>
<p>constant throughout the motion. Hence we 
use kinematic equations to calculate the 
</p>
<p>(ii) Now the conducting sphere is connected 
to the ground through a conducting wire. 
This is called grounding. Since the ground 
can always receive any amount of electrons, 
grounding removes the electron from 
the conducting sphere. Note that positive 
charges will not flow to the ground because 
they are attracted by the negative charges of 
the rod (Figure 1.47(b)). 
</p>
<p>(iii) When the grounding wire is removed 
from the conductor, the positive charges 
remain near the charged rod (Figure 
1.47(c))
</p>
<p>(iv) Now the charged rod is taken away 
from the conductor. As soon as the charged 
rod is removed, the positive charge gets 
distributed uniformly on the surface of the 
conductor (Figure 1.47 (d)). By this process, 
the neutral conducting sphere becomes 
positively charged.
</p>
<p>For an arbitrary shaped conductor, the 
intermediate steps and conclusion are the 
same except the final step. The distribution 
of positive charges is not uniform for 
arbitrarily-shaped conductors. Why is it not 
uniform? The reason for it is discussed in 
the section 1.9
</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 1.19
</p>
<p>A small ball of conducting material 
having a charge +q and mass m is thrown 
upward at an angle θ to horizontal 
surface with an initial speed vo  as shown 
in the figure. There exists an uniform 
electric field E downward along with the 
gravitational field g. Calculate the range, 
maximum height and time of flight in the 
motion of this charged ball. Neglect the 
effect of air and treat the ball as a point 
mass.

<p>1.7.4 Dielectrics or 
insulators
</p>
<p>A dielectric is a non-conducting 
material and has no free electrons. The 
electrons in a dielectric are bound within 
the atoms. Ebonite, glass and mica are some 
examples of dielectrics. When an external 
electric field is applied, the electrons are 
not free to move anywhere but they are 
realigned in a specific way. A dielectric is 
made up of either polar molecules or non-
polar molecules.
</p>
<p>Non-polar molecules
A non-polar molecule is one in which 
</p>
<p>centres of positive and negative charges 
coincide. As a result, it has no permanent 
dipole moment. Examples of non-polar 
molecules are hydrogen (H2), oxygen (O2), 
and carbon dioxide (CO2) etc. 
</p>
<p>When an external electric field is 
applied, the centres of positive and 
negative charges are separated by a small 
distance which induces dipole moment in 
the direction of the external electric field. 
Then the dielectric is said to be polarized 
by an external electric field. This is shown 
in Figure 1.48.

<p>1.7.5 Induced Electric field 
inside the dielectric
</p>
<p>When an external electric field is 
applied on a conductor, the charges are 
aligned in such a way that an internal 
electric field is created which tends to 
cancel the external electric field. But in 
the case of a dielectric, which has no free 
electrons, the external electric field only 
realigns the charges so that an internal 
electric field is produced. The magnitude 
of the internal electric field is smaller than 
that of external electric field. Therefore 
the net electric field inside the dielectric 
is not zero but is parallel to an external 
electric field with magnitude less than that 
of the external electric field. For example, 
let us consider a rectangular dielectric slab 
placed between two oppositely charged 
plates (capacitor) as shown in the Figure 
1.50. 
</p>
<p>The uniform electric field between 
the plates acts as an external electric field 

</p>
<p>Eext  which polarizes the dielectric placed 
between plates. The positive charges are 
induced on one side surface and negative 
charges are induced on the other side of 
surface. 
</p>
<p>But inside the dielectric, the net charge 
is zero even in a small volume. So the 
dielectric in the external field is equivalent 
to two oppositely charged sheets with the 
surface charge densities +σb and &ndash;σb. These 
charges are called bound charges. They 
are not free to move like free electrons in 
</p>
<p>Polar molecules
In polar molecules, the centres of the 
</p>
<p>positive and negative charges are separated 
even in the absence of an external 
electric field. They have a permanent 
dipole moment. Due to thermal motion, 
the direction of each dipole moment 
is oriented randomly (Figure 1.49(a)). 
Hence the net dipole moment is zero in 
the absence of an external electric field. 
Examples of polar molecules are H2O, 
N2O, HCl, NH3.
</p>
<p>When an external electric field is 
applied, the dipoles inside the material 
tend to align in the direction of the 
electric field. Hence a net dipole moment 
is induced in it. Then the dielectric is said 
to be polarized by an external electric field 
(Figure 1.49(b)).

<p>1.7.6 Dielectric strength
</p>
<p>When the external electric field 
applied to a dielectric is very large, it 
tears the atoms apart so that the bound 
charges become free charges. Then the 
dielectric starts to conduct electricity. 
This is called dielectric breakdown. The 
maximum electric field the dielectric can 
withstand before it breaksdown is called 
dielectric strength. For example, the 
dielectric strength of air is  3 &times; 106 V m&ndash;1. If 
the applied electric field increases beyond 
this, a spark is produced in the air. The 
dielectric strengths of some dielectrics are 
given in the Table 1.1.

CAPACITORS AND

<p>1.8.1 Capacitors
</p>
<p>Capacitor is a device used to store electric 
charge and electrical energy. It consists of two 
conducting objects (usually plates or sheets) 
separated by some distance. Capacitors are 
widely used in many electronic circuits and 
have applications in many areas of science 
and technology.

<p>conductors. This is shown in the Figure 
1.50.
</p>
<p>For example, the charged balloon after 
rubbing sticks onto a wall. The reason 
is that the negatively charged balloon is 
brought near the wall, it polarizes opposite 
charges on the surface of the wall, which 
attracts the balloon. This is shown in 
Figure 1.51.

<p>The SI unit of capacitance is coulomb per 
volt or farad (F) in honor of Michael Faraday. 
Farad is a larger unit of capacitance. In 
practice, capacitors are available in the range 
of microfarad (1&micro;F = 10&ndash;6 F) to picofarad (1pF 
= 10&ndash;12 F). A capacitor is represented by the 
symbol  or . Note that the total charge 
stored in the capacitor is zero (Q &ndash; Q = 0). 
When we say the capacitor stores charges, 
it means the amount of charge that can be 
stored in any one of the plates.
</p>
<p>Nowadays there are capacitors available 
in various shapes (cylindrical, disk) and 
types (tantalum, ceramic and electrolytic), 
as shown in Figure 1.53. These capacitors 
are extensively used in various kinds of 
electronic circuits.

<p>Capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor
Consider a capacitor with two parallel 
</p>
<p>plates each of cross-sectional area A and 
separated by a distance d as shown in  
Figure 1.54.

<p>distance d is very much smaller than the size 
of the plate (d2 &lt;&lt; A), then the above result 
can be used even for finite&ndash;sized parallel 
plate capacitor.
</p>
<p>A simple capacitor consists of two 
parallel metal plates separated by a small 
distance as shown in Figure 1.52 (a).

</p>
<p>When a capacitor is connected to 
a battery of potential difference V, the 
electrons are transferred from one plate 
to the other plate by battery so that one 
plate becomes negatively charged with a 
charge of &ndash;Q and the other plate positively 
charged  with +Q. The potential difference 
between the plates is equivalent to the 
battery&rsquo;s terminal voltage. This is shown 
in Figure 1.52 (b). If the battery voltage is 
increased, the amount of charges stored 
in the plates also increase. In general, 
the charge stored in the capacitor is 
proportional to the potential difference 
between the plates.

<p>(i) If the area of cross-section of the 
capacitor plates is increased, more charges 
can be distributed for the same potential 
difference. As a result, the capacitance is 
increased.
</p>
<p>(ii) If the distance d between the two 
plates is reduced, the potential difference 
between the plates (V = Ed) decreases 
with E constant. As a result, voltage 
difference between the terminals of the 
battery increases which in turn leads to an 
additional flow of charge to the plates from 
the battery, till the voltage on the capacitor 
equals to the battery&rsquo;s terminal voltage. 
Suppose the distance  is increased, the 
capacitor voltage increases and becomes 
greater than the battery voltage. Then, 
the charges flow from capacitor plates to 
battery till both voltages becomes equal.

</p>
<p>From equation (1.89), we infer that the 
energy is stored in the electric field existing 
between the plates of the capacitor. Once the 
capacitor is allowed to discharge, the energy 
is retrieved. 
</p>
<p>It is important to note that the energy 
density depends only on the electric field 
and not on the size of the plates of the 
capacitor. In fact, expression (1.89) is true 
for the electric field due to any type of charge 
configuration.
</p>
<p>Sometimes we notice that the ceiling 
fan does not start rotating as soon as it 
is switched on. But when we rotate the 
blades, it starts to rotate as usual. Why it 
is so? We know that to rotate any object, 
there must be a torque applied on the 
object. For the ceiling fan, the initial 
torque is given by the capacitor widely 
known as a condenser. If the condenser 
is faulty, it will not give sufficient initial 
torque to rotate the blades when the fan is 
switched on.
</p>
<p>1.8.2 Energy stored in the 
capacitor
</p>
<p>Capacitor not only stores the charge 
but also it stores energy. When a battery is 
connected to the capacitor, electrons of total 
charge &ndash;Q are transferred from one plate to 
the other plate. To transfer the charge, work 
is done by the battery. This work done is 
stored as electrostatic potential energy in 
the capacitor. 
</p>
<p>To transfer an infinitesimal charge dQ 
for a potential difference V, the work done 
is given by
</p>
<p>dW = V dQ (1.85)

<p>where V Q

<p>1.8.4 Effect of dielectrics in 
capacitors
</p>
<p>In earlier discussions, we assumed that 
the space between the parallel plates of a 
capacitor is either empty or filled with air. 
Suppose dielectrics like mica, glass or paper 
are introduced between the plates, then the 
capacitance of the capacitor is altered. The 
dielectric can be inserted into the plates in 
two different ways. (i) when the capacitor is 
disconnected from the battery. (ii) when the 
capacitor is connected to the battery.
</p>
<p>(i)  when the capacitor is disconnected 
from the battery
</p>
<p>Consider a capacitor with two parallel 
plates each of cross-sectional area A and are 
separated by a distance d. The capacitor is 
charged by a battery of voltage V0 and the 
charge stored is Q0. The capacitance of the 
capacitor without the dielectric is 
</p>
<p>C
Q
V0
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>=  (1.90)
</p>
<p>The battery is then disconnected from 
the capacitor and the dielectric is inserted 
between the plates. This is shown in  
Figure 1.56.
</p>
<p>1.8.3 Applications of 
capacitors
</p>
<p>Capacitors are used in various electronics 
circuits. A few of the applications.
(a) Flash capacitors are used in digital 
cameras for taking photographs. The 
flash which comes from the camera 
when we take photographs is due  
to the energy released from the capacitor, 
called a flash capacitor (Figure 1.55 (a))
(b) During cardiac arrest, a device called 
heart defibrillator is used to give a sudden 
surge of a large amount of electrical energy to 
the patient&rsquo;s chest to retrieve the normal heart 
function. This is shown in Figure 1.55 (b).
</p>
<p>(c) Capacitors are used in the ignition 
system of automobile engines to eliminate 
sparking
</p>
<p>(d) Capacitors are used to reduce power 
fluctuations in power supplies and to increase 
the efficiency of power transmission.
</p>
<p> However, capacitors have disadvantage 
as well. Even after the battery or power supply 
is removed, the capacitor stores charges and 
energy for some time. For example if the TV 
is switched off, it is always advisable to not 
touch the back side of the TV panel.

decreased.

<p>Since er &gt; 1 we get U &lt; Uo. There is 
a decrease in energy because,when the 
dielectric is inserted, the capacitor spends 
some energy in pulling the dielectric inside. 
</p>
<p>(ii)  When the battery remains connected 
to the capacitor
Let us now consider what happens when 
</p>
<p>the battery of voltage V0 remains connected 
to the capacitor when the dielectric is 
inserted into the capacitor. This is shown in 
Figure1.57.
</p>
<p>The potential difference V0 across the 
plates remains constant. But it is found 
experimentally (first shown by Faraday) 
that when dielectric is inserted, the charge 
stored in the capacitor is increased by a 
factor er.

Experimentally it is found that the modified

capacitors when there is no dielectric 
and er is the relative permittivity of the 
dielectric or simply known as the dielectric 
constant. Since er &gt; 1, the electric field  
E &lt; Eo. 
</p>
<p>As a result, the electrostatic potential 
difference between the plates (V = Ed) is also 
reduced. But at the same time, the charge 
Qo will remain constant once the battery is 
disconnected.

Therefore as V decreases, C increases.

<p>When the dielectric is removed, it 
experiences an inward pulling force due 
to the plates. To remove the dielectric, 
an external agency has to do work on the

<p>The sum of the voltages across the 
capacitor must be equal to the voltage of the 
battery.

<p>V = V1 + V2 + V3 (1.103)

<p>If three capacitors in series are considered 
to form an equivalent single capacitor Cs  
</p>
<p>shown in Figure 1.58(b), then we have

</p>
<p>Thus, the inverse of the equivalent 
capacitance CS of three capacitors 
connected in series is equal to the sum 
of the inverses of each capacitance. This 
equivalent capacitance CS is always less 
than the smallest individual capacitance in 
the series. 
</p>
<p>(ii) Capacitance in parallel
</p>
<p>Consider three capacitors of capacitance 
C1, C2 and C3 connected in parallel with  
a battery of voltage V as shown in  
Figure 1.59 (a).
</p>
<p>Since corresponding sides of the 
capacitors are connected to the same 
positive and negative terminals of the 
battery, the voltage across each capacitor 
is equal to the battery&rsquo;s voltage. Since 
capacitances of the capacitors are different, 
</p>
<p>&ndash;Q are transferred from negative terminal 
to the right plate of C3 which pushes the 
electrons of same amount &ndash;Q from left 
plate of C3 to the right plate of C2 due to 
electrostatic induction. Similarly, the left 
plate of C2 pushes the charges of &ndash;Q to the 
right plate of C1 which induces the positive 
charge +Q on the left plate of C1. At the same 
time, electrons of charge &ndash;Q are transferred 
from left plate of C1 to positive terminal of 
the battery.
</p>
<p>By these processes, each capacitor 
stores the same amount of charge Q. The 
capacitances of the capacitors are in general 
different, so that the voltage across each 
capacitor is also different and are denoted as 
V1, V2 and V3 respectively.

</p>
<p>Thus, the equivalent capacitance of 
capacitors connected in parallel is equal 
to the sum of the individual capacitances. 
The equivalent capacitance CP in a parallel 
connection is always greater than the 
largest individual capacitance. In a parallel 
connection, it is equivalent as area of each 
capacitance adds to give more effective 
area such that total capacitance increases.
</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 1.22
</p>
<p>Find the equivalent capacitance between P 
and Q for the configuration shown below 
in the figure (a).

</p>
<p>1&micro;F
</p>
<p>(a) (b) (c) (d)
</p>
<p>&micro;F
</p>
<p>Solution
</p>
<p>The capacitors 1 &micro;F and  3 &micro;F are 
connected in parallel and 6 &micro;F and 2 &micro;F 
are also separately connected in parallel. 
So these parallel combinations reduced 
to equivalent single capacitances in their 
respective positions, as shown in the  
figure (b).
</p>
<p>Ceq = 1 + 3 = 4 &micro;F
</p>
<p>Ceq = 6 + 2 = 8 &micro;F
</p>
<p>From the figure (b), we infer that the two 
4 &micro;F capacitors are connected in series and 
the two 8 &micro;F capacitors are connected in 
series. By using formula for the series, we 
can reduce to their equivalent capacitances 
as shown in  figure (c).
</p>
<p>the charge stored in each capacitor is not 
the same. Let the charge stored in the three 
capacitors be Q1, Q2, and Q3 respectively. 
According to the law of conservation of 
total charge, the sum of these three charges 
is equal to the charge Q transferred by the 
battery,
</p>
<p>Q = Q1 +Q2 +Q3 (1.106)
</p>
<p>Since    Q = CV, we have 
</p>
<p>Q = C1V + C2V + C3V (1.107)
</p>
<p>If these three capacitors are considered 
to form a single equivalent capacitance CP  
which stores the total charge Q as shown in 
the Figure 1.59(b), then we can write Q = CPV. 
Substituting this in equation (1.107), we get
</p>
<p>CPV = C1V + C2V + C3V

<p>    CP = C1 + C2 + C3 (1.108)

<p>If a charge Q is introduced into any one of 
the spheres, this charge Q is redistributed into 
both the spheres such that the electrostatic 
potential is same in both the spheres. They 
are now uniformly charged and attain 
electrostatic equilibrium. Let q1 be the charge 
residing on the surface of sphere A and q2 is 
the charge residing on the surface of sphere 
B such that Q = q1 + q2. The charges are 
distributed only on the surface and there is 
no net charge inside the conductor.

<p>The surface of the conductor is an

and

<p>into equation (1.112), we get

</p>
<p>Consider a charged conductor of 
irregular shape as shown in Figure 1.61 (a).
</p>
<p>Thus the surface charge density σ is 
inversely proportional to the radius of the 
sphere. For a smaller radius, the charge 
density will be larger and vice versa.
</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 1.23
</p>
<p>Two conducting spheres of radius  
r1 = 8 cm and r2 = 2 cm are separated by 
a distance much larger than 8 cm and 
are connected by a thin conducting wire 
as shown in the figure. A total charge of  
Q = +100 nC is placed on one of the spheres. 
After a fraction of a second, the charge  
Q is redistributed and both the spheres 
attain electrostatic equilibrium.

<p>Unit 1  Electrostatics 65
</p>
<p>This device consists of a long thick 
copper rod passing from top of the building 
to the ground. The upper end of the rod has 
a sharp spike or a sharp needle as shown in 
Figure 1.62 (a) and (b).
</p>
<p>Figure 1.62 (a) Schematic diagram of 
a lightning arrestor. (b) A house with a 
lightning arrestor
</p>
<p>The lower end of the rod is connected to 
copper plate which is buried deep into the 
ground. When a negatively charged cloud 
is passing above the building, it induces 
a positive charge on the spike. Since the 
induced charge density on thin sharp spike 
is large, it results in a corona discharge. This 
positive charge ionizes the surrounding air 
which in turn neutralizes the negative charge 
in the cloud. The negative charge pushed to 
the spikes passes through the copper rod and 
</p>
<p>Figure 1.61 Action of points or corona 
discharge
</p>
<p>We know that smaller the radius of 
curvature, the larger is the charge density. 
The end of the conductor which has larger 
curvature (smaller radius) has a large charge 
accumulation as shown in Figure 1.61 (b). 
</p>
<p>As a result, the electric field near this edge 
is very high and it ionizes the surrounding 
air. The positive ions are repelled at the sharp 
edge and negative ions are attracted towards 
the sharper edge. This reduces the total charge 
of the conductor near the sharp edge. This is 
called action of points or corona discharge.
</p>
<p>1.9.3 Lightning arrester or 
lightning conductor
</p>
<p>This is a device used to protect tall 
buildings from lightning strikes. It works on 
the principle of action at points or corona 
discharge.

<p>the positive charges are distributed uniformly 
on the outer surface of the hollow sphere. At 
the same time, the negative charges nullify 
the positive charges in the belt due to corona 
discharge before it passes over the pulley. 
</p>
<p>When the belt descends, it has almost no 
net charge. At the bottom, it again gains a 
large positive charge. The belt goes up and 
delivers the positive charges to the outer 
surface of the sphere. This process continues 
until the outer surface produces the potential 
difference of the order of 107 which is the 
limiting value. We cannot store charges 
beyond this limit since the extra charge 
starts leaking to the surroundings due to 
ionization of air. The leakage of charges can

arrester does not stop the lightning; rather 
it diverts the lightning to the ground safely.
</p>
<p>1.9.4 Van de Graaff 
Generator
</p>
<p>In the year 1929, Robert Van de Graaff 
designed a machine which produces a large 
amount of electrostatic potential difference, 
up to several million volts (107 V). This Van 
de Graff generator works on the principle of 
electrostatic induction and action at points.
</p>
<p>A large hollow spherical conductor is 
fixed on the insulating stand as shown in 
Figure 1.63. A pulley B is mounted at the 
centre of the hollow sphere and another 
pulley C is fixed at the bottom. A belt made 
up of insulating materials like silk or rubber 
runs over both pulleys. The pulley C is 
driven continuously by the electric motor. 
Two comb shaped metallic conductors E 
and D are fixed near the pulleys.
</p>
<p>The comb D is maintained at a positive 
potential of 104 V by a power supply. The 
upper comb E is connected to the inner side 
of the hollow metal sphere.
</p>
<p>Due to the high electric field near comb 
D, air between the belt and comb D gets 
ionized by the action of points. The positive 
charges are pushed towards the belt and 
negative charges are attracted towards the 
comb D. The positive charges stick to the 
belt and move up. When the positive charges 
on the belt reach the point near the comb E, 
the comb E acquires negative charge and 
the sphere acquires positive charge due 
to electrostatic induction. As a result, the 
positive charges are pushed away from the 
comb E and they reach the outer surface of 
the sphere. Since the sphere is a conductor,

<p>INTRODUCTION
In unit 1, we studied the properties of charges 
when they are at rest. In reality, the charges 
are always moving within the materials. For 
example, the electrons in a copper wire are 
never at rest and are continuously in random 
motion. Therefore it is important to analyse the 
behaviour of charges when they are in motion. 
The motion of charges constitutes &lsquo;electric 
current&rsquo;. Current electricity is the study of flow of 
electric charges. It owes its origin to Alessandro 
Volta (1745-1827), who invented the electric 
battery which produced the first steady flow of 
electric current. Modern world depends heavily 
on the use of electricity. It is used to operate 
machines, communication systems, electronic 
devices, home appliances etc., In this unit, we 
will study about the electric current, resistance 
and related phenomenon in materials.

<p>conductor to other end and hence no current 
in the conductor. When a potential difference 
is applied by the battery across the ends of the 
conductor, the free electrons drift towards the 
positive terminal of the battery, producing a net 
electric current. This is easily understandable 
from the analogy given in the Figure 2.1. 
</p>
<p>In the XI Volume 2, unit 6, we studied, 
that the mass move from higher gravitational 
potential to lower gravitational potential. 
Likewise, positive charge flows from region 
of higher electric potential to region of lower 
electric potential and negative charge flows 
from region of lower electric potential to 
region of higher electric potential. So battery 
or electric cell simply creates potential 
difference across the conductor.

<p>Matter is made up of atoms. Each atom 
consists of a positively charged nucleus with 
negatively charged electrons moving around 
the nucleus. Atoms in metals have one or 
more electrons which are loosely bound to the 
nucleus. These electrons are called free electrons 
and can be easily detached from the atoms. The 
substances which have an abundance of these 
free electrons are called conductors. These 
free electrons move randomly throughout 
the conductor at a given temperature. In 
general due to this random motion, there is 
no net transfer of charges from one end of the

</p>
<p>In an electric circuit, arrow heads are used 
to indicate the direction of flow of current. By 
convention, this flow in the circuit should be 
from the positive terminal of the battery to 
the negative terminal. This current is called 
the conventional current or simply current 
and is in the direction in which a positive 
test charge would move. In typical circuits 
the charges that flow are actually electrons, 
from the negative terminal of the battery to 
the positive terminal. As a result, the flow of 
electrons and the direction 
of conventional current 
point in opposite direction 
as shown in Figure 2.3. 
Mathematically, a transfer 
of positive charge is the

<p>The electric current in a conductor is 
defined as the rate of flow of charges through 
a given cross-sectional area A. It is shown in 
the Figure 2.2.

<p>Where ∆Q is the amount of charge that 
passes through the conductor at any cross

rate at which charge flows changes with time, 
the current also changes. The instantaneous 
current I is defined as the limit of the average

<p>electric field accelerates the electrons, while 
ions scatter the electrons and change their 
direction of motion. Thus, we see zigzag 
motion of electrons. In addition to the 
zigzag motion due to the collisions, the 
electrons move slowly along the conductor 
in a direction opposite to that of 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>E  as shown 
in the Figure 2.4.
</p>
<p>Ions
</p>
<p>Any material is made up of neutral 
atoms with equal number of electrons 
and protons. If the outermost electrons 
leave the atoms, they become free 
electrons and are responsible for 
electric current. The atoms after losing 
their outer most electrons will have 
more positive charges and hence are 
called positive ions. These ions will not 
move freely within the material like the 
free electrons. Hence the positive ions 
will not give rise to current.

<p>This velocity is called drift velocity vd . The 
drift velocity is the average velocity acquired 
by the electrons inside the conductor when  
</p>
<p>same as a transfer of negative charge in the 
opposite direction.
</p>
<p>Electric current is not only produced 
by batteries. In nature, lightning bolt 
produces enormous electric current 
in a short time. During lightning, very 
high potential difference is created 
between the clouds and ground and 
hence charges flow between the clouds 
and ground.
</p>
<p>2.1.2 Drift velocity
</p>
<p>In a conductor the charge carriers 
are free electrons. These electrons move 
freely through the conductor and collide 
repeatedly with the positive ions. If there 
is no electric field, the electrons move 
in random directions, and hence their 
velocities are also randomly oriented. On an 
average, the number of electrons travelling 
in any direction will be equal to the number 
of electrons travelling in the opposite 
direction. As a result, there is no net flow of 
electrons in any direction and hence there 
will not be any current.

across the conductor by connecting a

<p>Misconception

</p>
<p>the battery is the source of electrons. It 
is not true. When a battery is connected 
across the given wire, the electrons in the 
closed circuit resulting the current. Battery 
sets the potential difference (electrical 
energy) due to which these electrons in 
the conducting wire flow in a particular 
direction. The resulting electrical energy 
is used by electric bulb, electric fan etc. 
Similarly the electricity board is supplying 
the electrical energy to our home.
</p>

the battery in my mobile&rsquo; and &lsquo;my 
mobile phone battery has no charge&rsquo; 
etc. These sentences are not correct.

<p>The SI unit of mobility is m V s 12 1- - .
</p>
<p>The typical drift velocity of 
electrons in the wire is 10&ndash;4 m s&ndash;1.  
If an electron drifts with this 
speed, then the electrons 
</p>
<p>leaving the battery will take hours to reach 
the light bulb. Then how electric bulbs 
glow as soon as we switch on the battery?  
When battery is switched on, the electrons 
begin to move away from the negative 
terminal of the battery and this electron 
exerts force on the nearby electrons. This 
process creates a propagating influence 
(electric field) that travels through the 
wire at the speed of light. In other words, 
the energy is transported from the battery 
to bulb at the speed of light through 
propagating influence (electric field). Due 
to this reason, the bulb glows as soon as the 
battery is switched on.

<p>Why current density is a vector 
but current is a scalar? 
</p>
<p>In general, the current I is 
defined as the scalar product of the 
current density and area vector in which 
the charges cross.
</p>
<p>The current I can be positive or negative 
depending on the choice of the unit 
vector normal to the surface area A.

<p>Materials for which the current versus 
voltage graph is a straight line through the 
origin, are said to obey Ohm&rsquo;s law and their 
behaviour is said to be ohmic as shown in 
Figure 2.8(a). Materials or devices that do 
not follow Ohm&rsquo;s law are said to be non-
ohmic. These materials have more complex 
relationships between voltage and current. A 
plot of I versus V for a non-ohmic material is 
non-linear and they do not have a constant 
resistance (Figure 2.8(b)).
</p>
<p>When a potential difference V is applied 
across the wire, a net electric field is created 
in the wire which constitutes the current in 
the wire. For simplicity, we assume that the 
electric field is uniform in the entire length 
of the wire, then the potential difference 
(voltage V) can be written as

that the resistance is directly proportional 
to the length of the conductor and inversely

</p>
<p>Therefore, the macroscopic form of

<p>V = IR (2.16)

<p>If  l = 1 m and A = 1 m2, then the resistance  
R = ρ. In other words, the electrical 
resistivity of a material is defined as the 
resistance offered to current flow by a 
conductor of unit length having unit area of

(Ω m). Based on the resistivity, materials are

conductors. The conductors have lowest

and semiconductors have resistivity greater

reason why repairing the electrical connection

</p>
<p>this reason, the current I passing through 
all the three resistors is the same. According 
to Ohm&rsquo;s law, if same current pass through 
different resistors of different values, then 
the potential difference across each resistor 
must be different. If V1, V2 and V3 be the 
potential differences (voltage) across each 
of the resistors R1, R2 and R3 respectively, 
then we can write V1 = IR1, V2 = IR2  
and V3 = IR3. But the supply voltage V must 
be equal to the sum of voltages(potential 
differences) across each resistor.
</p>
<p>V = V1 + V2 + V3 = IR1 + IR2 + IR3 (2.21)
</p>
<p>V = I (R1 + R2 + R3)
</p>
<p>V = IRS (2.22)
</p>
<p>where RS is the equivalent resistance.
</p>
<p>RS= R1 + R2 + R3 (2.23)
</p>
<p>When several resistors are connected 
in series, the total or equivalent resistance 
is the sum of the individual resistances as 
shown in the Figure 2.9 (b).
</p>
<p>Note: The value of equivalent resistance 
in series connection will be greater than 
each individual resistance.

<p>2.2.2 Resistors in series and

</p>
<p>An electric circuit may contain a number 
of resistors which can be connected in 
different ways. For each type of circuit, 
we can calculate the equivalent resistance 
produced by a group of individual resistors.
</p>
<p>Resistors in series
When two or more resistors are connected 
</p>
<p>end to end, they are said to be in series. The 
resistors could be simple resistors or bulbs 
or heating elements or other devices. Figure 
2.9 (a) shows three resistors R1, R2 and R3 
connected in series. 
</p>
<p>The amount of charge passing through 
resistor R1 must also pass through resistors 
R2 and R3 since the charges cannot 
accumulate anywhere in the circuit. Due to

</p>
<p>Here RP  is the equivalent resistance of the 
parallel combination of the resistors. Thus, 
when a number of resistors are connected 
in parallel, the sum of the reciprocals of 
resistance of the individual resistors is equal 
to the reciprocal of the effective resistance 
of the combination as shown in the Figure 
2.10 (b).
</p>
<p>Note: The value of equivalent resistance 
in parallel connection will be lesser than 
each individual resistance. 
</p>
<p>House hold appliances are always 
connected in parallel so that even if one 
is switched off, the other devices could 
function properly.
</p>
<p>Solution
</p>
<p>Since the resistors are connected in series, 
the effective resistance in the circuit

</p>
<p>Resistors in parallel
Resistors are in parallel when they are 
connected across the same potential 
difference as shown in Figure 2.10 (a).
</p>
<p>In this case, the total current I that 
leaves the battery is split into three separate 
components. Let I1, I2 and I3 be the 
current through the resistors R1, R2 and R3  
respectively. Due to the conservation of 
charge, total current in the circuit I is equal 
to sum of the currents through each of the 
three resistors.
</p>
<p>I = I1 + I2 + I3 (2.24)

<p>Solution
</p>
<p>Case (a)
</p>
<p>To find the equivalent resistance between 
the points a and b, we assume that a 
current is entering the junction at a. 
Since all the resistances in the outside 
loop are the same (1Ω), the current in 
the branches ac and ad must be equal. 
Hence the points C and D are at the 
same potential and no current through 
5 Ω. It implies that the 5 Ω has no role 
in determining the equivalent resistance 
and it can be removed. So the circuit is 
simplified as shown in the figure.

<p>α of semiconductors
For semiconductors, the resistivity 
</p>
<p>decreases with increase in temperature. As 
the temperature increases, more electrons 
will be liberated from their atoms (Refer 
unit 9 for conduction in semi conductors). 
</p>
<p>2.2.4 Temperature 
dependence of resistivity
</p>
<p>The resistivity of a material is dependent 
on temperature. It is experimentally found 
that for a wide range of temperatures, the 
resistivity of a conductor increases with 
increase in temperature according to the 
expression,
</p>
<p>ρ ρ αT T T= + &minus;( )

</p>
<p>
0 01  (2.27)
</p>
<p>where ρT is the resistivity of a conductor 
at T oC, ρ0 is the resistivity of the conductor 
at some reference temperature T0 (usually at 
20oC) and α is the temperature coefficient 
of resistivity. It is defined as the ratio of 
increase in resistivity per degree rise in 
temperature to its resistivity at T0.
</p>
<p>From the equation (2.27), we can write

</p>
<p>where ∆ρ = ρT &ndash; ρ0 is change in resistivity 
for a change in temperature ∆T = T &ndash; T0. Its 
unit is per oC. 
</p>
<p>α of conductors
For conductors α is positive. If the 
</p>
<p>temperature of a conductor increases, the 
average kinetic energy of electrons in the 
conductor increases. This results in more 
frequent collisions and hence the resistivity 
increases. The graph of the equation (2.27) 
is shown in Figure 2.13.
</p>
<p>Even though, the resistivity of conductors 
like metals varies linearly for wide range 
of temperatures, there also exists a non-
linear region at very low temperatures. The 
resistivity approaches some finite value as 
the temperature approaches absolute zero as 
shown in Figure 2.13(b).

</p>
<p>We can understand the temperature 
dependence of resistivity in the following 
way. In section 2.1.3, we have shown that 
</p>
<p>the electrical conductivity, σ τ
=
</p>
<p>ne
m
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>. As the 
</p>
<p>resistivity is inverse of σ, it can be written as
</p>
<p>ρ
τ
</p>
<p>=
m
</p>
<p>ne2
 (2.30)
</p>
<p>The resistivity of materials is 
 i)  inversely proportional to the number 
</p>
<p>density (n) of the electrons
 ii)  inversely proportional to the average 
</p>
<p>time between the collisions (τ). 
In metals, if the temperature increases, the 
</p>
<p>average time between the collision (τ) decreases 
and n is independent of temperature. In 
semiconductors when temperature increases, 
n increases and τ decreases, but increase in n 
is dominant than decreasing τ, so that overall 
resistivity decreases.
</p>
<p>The resistance of certain 
materials become zero below 
certain temperature Tc. This 
</p>
<p>temperature is known as critical temperature 
or transition temperature. The materials 
which exhibit this property are known as 
superconductors. This phenomenon was 
first observed by Kammerlingh Onnes 
in 1911. He found that mercury exhibits 
superconductor behaviour at 4.2 K.  
Since R = 0, current once induced in a 
superconductor persists without any 
potential difference.
</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 2.13
</p>
<p>If the resistance of coil is 3 Ω at 200 C and 
α = 0.004/0C then determine its resistance 
at 100 0C.
</p>
<p>Hence the current increases and therefore 
the resistivity decreases as shown in 
Figure&nbsp;2.14. A semiconductor with a negative 
temperature coefficient of resistivity is called 
a thermistor.

coefficients of various materials are given in

ends of a conductor, a current is established. 
The battery is supplying energy to the device

Figure&nbsp;2.15.

<p>The Tamilnadu 
Electricity Board is charging 
for the amount of energy you 
</p>
<p>use and not for the power. A current 
of 1A flowing through a potential 
difference of 1V produces a power of 
1W.
</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 2.15
</p>
<p>A battery of voltage V is connected to 
30 W bulb and 60 W bulb as shown in 
the figure. (a) Identify brightest bulb

(c) Suppose the two bulbs are connected 
in series, which bulb will glow brighter?

<p>30W
</p>
<p>60W
</p>
<p>Solution
</p>
<p>(a) 	The power delivered by the battery  
P = VI. Since the bulbs are connected 
in parallel, the voltage drop across 
each bulb is the same. If the voltage is 
kept fixed, then the power is directly 
proportional to current (P &prop; I). So 
60 W bulb draws twice as much 
as current as 30 W and it will glow 
brighter than 30 W bulb.
</p>
<p>Figure 2.16 Electrical bulbs with power 
rating
</p>
<p>Usually these voltage rating refers AC 
RMS voltages. For a given bulb, if the voltage 
drop across the bulb is greater than voltage 
rating, the bulb will fuse.
</p>
<p>Using Ohm&rsquo;s law, power delivered to the 
resistance R is expressed in other forms
</p>
<p>P = IV = I (IR) = I2R (2.33)

<p>P = IV = V

</p>
<p> 
(2.34)
</p>
<p>The electrical power 
produced (dissipated) by 
a resistor is I2R. It depends 
</p>
<p>on the square of the current. Hence, 
if current is doubled, the power 
will increase by four times. Similar 
explanation holds true for voltage also.
</p>
<p>The total electrical energy used by 
any device is obtained by multiplying the 
power and duration of the time when it is 
ON. If the power is in watts and the time 
is in seconds, the energy will be in joules. 
In practice, electrical energy is measured in 
kilowatt hour (kWh). 1 kWh is known as 1 
unit of electrical energy.

<p>(1 kWh = 1000 Wh = (1000 W) (3600 s)

ELECTRIC CELLS AND 
BATTERIES
</p>
<p>An electric cell converts chemical energy 
into electrical energy to produce electricity. 
It contains two electrodes (carbon and zinc)
immersed in an electrolyte (sulphuric acid) 
as shown in Figure 2.17.
</p>
<p>Several electric cells connected 
together form a battery. When a cell or 
battery is connected to a circuit, electrons  
flow from the negative terminal to the 
positive terminal through the circuit. 
By using chemical reactions, a battery

<p>(b)	 	To calculate the resistance of the 
</p>
<p>bulbs, we use the relation P V

</p>
<p>. In 
both the bulbs, the voltage drop is 
the same. So the power is inversely

. It implies 
</p>
<p>that, the 30W has twice as much as 
resistance as 60 W bulb.
</p>
<p>(c)  When the bulbs are connected in 
series, the current passing through 
each bulb is the same. It is equivalent 
to two resistors connected in series. 
The bulb which has higher resistance 
has higher voltage drop. So 30W 
bulb will glow brighter than 60W 
bulb. So the higher power rating does 
not always imply more brightness 
and it depends whether bulbs are 
connected in series or parallel.
</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 2.16
</p>
<p>Two electric bulbs marked 20 W &ndash; 220 V  
and 100 W &ndash; 220 V are connected in 
series to 440 V supply. Which bulb will 
get fused?

</p>
<p>move a certain amount of charge around 
the circuit. It is denoted by the symbol 
ε. An ideal battery has zero internal 
resistance and the potential difference 
(terminal voltage) across the battery 
equals to its emf. In reality, the  battery is 
made of electrodes and electrolyte, there 
is resistance to the flow of charges within 
the battery. This resistance is called 
internal resistance r. For a real battery, 
the terminal voltage is not equal to the 
emf of the battery. A freshly prepared 
cell has low internal resistance and it 
increases with ageing. 
</p>
<p>2.4.2 Determination of 
internal resistance
</p>
<p>The circuit connections are made as shown 
in Figure 2.20. 
</p>
<p>The emf of cell ε is measured by 
connecting a high resistance voltmeter 
across it without connecting the external 
resistance R as shown in Figure 2.20(a). 
Since the voltmeter draws very little 
current for deflection, the circuit may be 
considered as open. Hence the voltmeter 
reading gives the emf of the cell. Then, 
external resistance R is included in the 
circuit and current I is established in the 
circuit. The potential difference across 
</p>
<p>produces potential difference across 
its terminals. This potential difference 
provides the energy to move the electrons 
through the circuit. Commercially 
available electric cells and batteries are 
shown in Figure 2.18.
</p>

</p>
<p>2.4.1 Electromotive force 
and internal resistance
</p>
<p>A battery or cell is called a source of 
electromotive force (emf). The term 
&lsquo;electromotive force&rsquo; is a misnomer since 
it does not really refer to a force but 
describes a potential difference in volts. 
The emf of a battery or cell is the voltage 
provided by the battery when no current 
flows in the external circuit. It is shown in 
Figure 2.19.
</p>
<p>Electromotive force determines the 
amount of work a battery or cell has to do

</p>
<p>Since ε, V and R are known, internal 
resistance r can be determined. We can 
also find the total current that flows in the 
circuit. 
</p>
<p>Due to this internal resistance, the power 
delivered to the circuit is not equal to power 
rating mentioned in the battery. For a battery 
of emf ε, with an internal resistance r, the 
power delivered to the circuit of resistance 
R is given by
</p>
<p>P = Iε = I (V + Ir)  (from equation 2.36)
</p>
<p>Here V is the voltage drop across the 
resistance R and it is equal to IR. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, P = I (IR +Ir)
</p>
<p>P = I2 R + I2 r (2.38)
</p>
<p>Here I 2r is the power delivered to the 
internal resistance and I 2R is the power 
delivered to the electrical device (here it is 
the resistance R). For a good battery, the 
internal resistance r is very small, then  
I 2r &lt;&lt; I 2R and almost entire power is 
delivered to the external resistance.
</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 2.17
</p>
<p>A battery has an emf of 12 V and connected 
to a resistor of 3 Ω. The current in the 
circuit is 3.93 A. Calculate (a) terminal 
voltage and the internal resistance of the 
battery (b) power delivered by the battery 
and power delivered to the resistor
</p>
<p>Solution
</p>
<p>The given values I = 3.93 A, ε = 12 V,  
R = 3 Ω
</p>
<p>(a)	 	The terminal voltage of the battery 
is equal to voltage drop across the 
resistor
</p>
<p> V = IR = 3.93 &times; 3 = 11.79 V
</p>
<p>R is equal to the potential difference 
across the cell (V) as shown in Figure 
2.20(b).
</p>
<p>The potential drop across the resistor R is
</p>
<p>V = IR (2.35)
</p>
<p>Due to internal resistance r of the cell, 
the voltmeter reads a value V, which is less 
than the emf of cell ε. It is because, certain 
amount of voltage (Ir) has dropped across 
the internal resistance r. 
</p>
<p>Then  V = ε &ndash; Ir 
</p>
<p>Ir = ε &ndash; V (2.36)

<p>KIRCHHOFF&rsquo;S RULES
</p>
<p>Ohm&rsquo;s law is useful only for simple circuits. 
For more complex circuits, Kirchhoff &rsquo;s 
rules can be used to find current and 
voltage. There are two generalized rules: 
i) Kirchhoff &rsquo;s current rule ii) Kirchhoff &rsquo;s 
voltage rule.
</p>
<p>2.5.1 Kirchhoff&rsquo;s first rule 
(Current rule or Junction rule)
</p>
<p>It states that the algebraic sum 
of the currents at any junction of a 
circuit is zero. It is a statement of law 
of conservation of electric charge. The 
charges that enter a given junction in a 
circuit must leave that junction since 
charge cannot build up or disappear at a 
junction. By convention, current entering 
the junction is taken as positive and 
current leaving the junction is taken as 
negative.
</p>
<p>The above equation implies that current 
due to the whole battery is the same as that 
due to a single cell. Hence it is advantageous 
to connect cells in parallel when the external 
resistance is very small compared to the 
internal resistance of the cells.
</p>
<p>When the car engine is 
started with headlights 
turned on, they sometimes 
</p>
<p>become dim. This is due to the internal 
resistance of the car battery.

<p>2.5.2 Kirchhoff&rsquo;s Second rule 
(Voltage rule or Loop rule)
</p>
<p>It states that in a closed circuit the 
algebraic sum of the products of the 
current and resistance of each part 
of the circuit is equal to the total emf 
included in the circuit. This rule follows 
from the law of conservation of energy for 
an isolated system (The energy supplied 
by the emf sources is equal to the sum of 
the energy delivered to all resistors). The 
product of current and resistance is taken as 
positive when the direction of the current is 
followed. Suppose if the direction of current 
is opposite to the direction of the loop, then 
product of current and voltage across the 
resistor is negative. It is shown in Figure 2.24 
(a) and (b). The emf is considered positive 
when proceeding from the negative to the 
positive terminal of the cell. It is shown in 
Figure 2.24 (c) and (d).

<p>We can denote the current that flows from 
9V battery as I1 and it splits up into I2 and  
(I1 &ndash; I2) at the junction E according 
Kirchhoff &rsquo;s current rule (KCR). 
</p>
<p>Now consider the loop EFCBE and apply 
KVR, we get

<p>1I2 + 3I1 + 2I1 = 9

<p>5I1 + I2 = 9 (1)

<p>Applying KVR to the loop EADFE, we get

<p>2.5.3  Wheatstone&rsquo;s bridge
</p>
<p>An important application of Kirchhoff &rsquo;s 
rules is the Wheatstone&rsquo;s bridge. It is used to 
compare resistances and in determining the 
unknown resistance in electrical network. 
The bridge consists of four resistances P, Q, 
R and S connected as shown in Figure 2.25. 
A galvanometer G is connected between the 
points B and D. The battery is connected 
between the points A and C. The current 
</p>
<p>Kirchhoff voltage rule has to be applied 
only when all currents in the circuit reach 
a steady state condition (the current in 
various branches are constant).
</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 2.21

<p>The following figure shows a complex 
network of conductors which can be divided 
into two closed loops like EACE and ABCA.

</p>
<p>A galvanometer is an instrument used for 
detecting and measuring even very small 
electric currents. It is extensively useful 
to compare the potential difference 
between various parts of the circuit.
</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 2.23

<p>In a Wheatstone&rsquo;s bridge P = 100 Ω,

</p>
<p>Applying Kirchhoff &rsquo;s voltage rule to loop 
ABCDA,
</p>
<p>I1P + I3Q &ndash; I4S &ndash; I2R = 0 (2.48)
</p>
<p>When the points B and D are at the 
same potential, the bridge is said to 
be balanced. As there is no potential 
difference between B and D, no current 
flows through galvanometer (IG = 0). 
Substituting IG = 0 in equation (2.45),

<p>2.5.4 Meter bridge
</p>
<p>The meter bridge is another form of 
Wheatstone&rsquo;s bridge. It consists of a uniform 
wire of manganin AB of one meter length. 
This wire is stretched along a metre scale on 
a wooden board between two copper strips 
C and D. Between these two copper strips 
another copper strip E is mounted to enclose 
two gaps G1 and G2 as shown in Figure 2.26. 
</p>
<p>An unknown resistance P is connected in 
G1 and a standard resistance Q is connected in 
G2. A jockey (conducting wire-contact maker) 
is connected to the terminal E on the central 
copper strip through a galvanometer (G) and 
a high resistance (HR). The exact position of 
jockey on the wire can be read on the scale. A 
Lechlanche cell and a key (K) are connected 
between the ends of the bridge wire.

<p>2.5.5 Potentiometer
</p>
<p>Potentiometer is used for the accurate 
measurement of potential differences, current 
and resistances. It consists of ten meter long 
uniform wire of manganin or constantan 
stretched in parallel rows each of 1 meter 
length, on a wooden board. The two free ends 
A and B are brought to the same side and 
fixed to copper strips with binding screws. 
A meter scale is fixed parallel to the wire. A 
jockey is provided for making contact.
</p>
<p>The principle of the potentiometer is 
illustrated in Figure 2.27. A steady current is 
maintained across the wire CD by a battery Bt.

of wire.

<p>The bridge wire is soldered at the ends of 
the copper strips. Due to imperfect contact, 
some resistance might be introduced at the 
contact. These are called end resistances. 
This error can be eliminated, if another 
set of readings is taken with P and Q 
interchanged and the average value of P is 
found.
</p>
<p>To find the specific resistance of the 
material of the wire in the coil P, the radius 
a and length l of the wire are measured. The 
specific resistance or resistivity ρ can be 
calculated using the relation.
</p>
<p>Resistance = ρ l

C of the wire is connected to the terminal 
M of a DPDT (Double Pole Double Throw) 
switch and the other terminal N is connected 
to a jockey through a galvanometer G and 
a high resistance HR. The cells whose emf 
ε1 and ε2 to be compared are connected to 
the terminals M1,N1 and M2,N2 of the DPDT 
switch. The positive terminals of Bt, ε1 and 
ε2 should be connected to the same end C.

Then the second cell ε2 is included in 
the circuit and the balancing length l2 is 
determined. Let r be the resistance per unit 
length of the potentiometer wire and I be 
the current flowing through the wire.

the cell ε, then no current will flow through

deflection. CJ is the balancing length l. The 
potential difference across CJ is equal to Irl 
where I is the current flowing through the 
wire and r is the resistance per unit length 
of the wire.

<p>Hence ε = Irl (2.58)

immersed in the water of 1 kg. How long 
the electrical heater has to be switched on

</p>
<p>current is known as Joule&rsquo;s heating effect. 
Just as current produces thermal energy, 
thermal energy may also be suitably used 
to produce an electromotive force. This is 
known as thermoelectric effect.
</p>
<p>2.6.1 Joule&rsquo;s law
</p>
<p>If a current I flows through a conductor 
kept across a potential difference V for a 
time t, the work done or the electric potential 
energy spent is 
</p>
<p>W = VIt (2.66)
</p>
<p>In the absence of any other external effect, 
this energy is spent in heating the conductor. 
The amount of heat(H) produced is 
</p>
<p>H = VIt (2.67)
</p>
<p>For a resistance R,
</p>
<p>H = I2Rt (2.68)
</p>
<p>This relation was experimentally verified 
by Joule and is known as Joule&rsquo;s law of 
heating. It states that the heat developed 
in an electrical circuit due to the flow of 
current varies directly as 
(i)  the square of the current
(ii)  the resistance of the circuit and
(iii)  the time of flow.
</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 2.27
</p>
<p>Find the heat energy produced in a 
resistance of 10 Ω when 5 A current flows 
through it for 5 minutes.
</p>
<p>Solution
R = 10 Ω, I = 5 A, t = 5 minutes = 5 &times; 60 s
H = I 2Rt
     = 52 &times; 10 &times; 5 &times; 60
     = 25 &times; 10 &times; 300
     = 25 &times; 3000
     = 75000 J (or) 75 kJ

Whenever there is an excessive current 
produced due to faulty wire connection, the 
circuit breaker switch opens. After repairing 
the faulty connection, we can close the 
circuit breaker switch. It is shown in the

<p>2. Electric fuses
Fuses as shown in Figure 2.31, are 
</p>
<p>connected in series in a circuit to protect the 
electric devices from the heat developed by 
the passage of excessive current. It is a short 
length of a wire made of a low melting point 
material. It melts and breaks the circuit if 
current exceeds a certain value. An alloy 
of lead - tin is used for fuses when current 
rating is below 15 A and when current rating 
is above 15 A, copper fuse wires are used.
</p>
<p>The only disadvantage with the above 
fuses is that once fuse wire is burnt due to 
excessive current, they need to be replaced. 
Nowadays in houses, circuit breakers

<p>2.7.1 Seebeck effect
</p>
<p>Seebeck discovered that in a closed circuit 
consisting of two dissimilar metals, when 
the junctions are maintained at different 
temperatures an emf (potential difference) 
is developed. The current that flows due to 
the emf developed is called thermoelectric 
current. The two dissimilar metals 
connected to form two junctions is known 
as thermocouple (Figure 2.35).

</p>
<p>If the hot and cold junctions are 
interchanged, the direction of current also 
reverses. Hence the effect is reversible.
</p>
<p>The magnitude of the emf developed in 
a thermocouple depends on (i) the nature 
of the metals forming the couple and (ii) 
the temperature difference between the 
junctions. 
</p>
<p>Applications of Seebeck effect
1.	 Seebeck effect is used in 
</p>
<p>thermoelectric generators (Seebeck 
generators).These thermoelectric 
generators are used in power plants 
to convert waste heat into electricity. 
</p>

<p>4. Electrical lamp
It consists of a tungsten filament (melting point 
33800C) kept inside a glass bulb and heated 
to incandescence by current. In incandescent 
electric lamps only about 5% of electrical energy 
is converted into light and the rest is wasted as 
heat. Electric discharge lamps, electric welding 
and electric arc also utilize the heating effect of 
current as shown in Figure 2.34.

<p>THERMOELECTRIC EFFECT
</p>
<p>Conversion of temperature differences 
into electrical voltage and vice versa 
is known as thermoelectric effect.  
A thermoelectric device generates voltage 
when there is a temperature difference on 
each side. If a voltage is applied, it generates 
a temperature difference.

<p>gets heated and junction B gets cooled as 
shown in the Figure 2.36(b). Hence Peltier 
effect is reversible. 
</p>
<p>2.7.3 Thomson effect
</p>
<p>Thomson showed that if two points in a 
conductor are at different temperatures, 
the density of electrons at these points 
will differ and as a result the potential 
difference is created between these points. 
Thomson effect is also reversible.

</p>
<p>If current is passed through a copper bar 
AB which is heated at the middle point C, 
the point C will be at   higher potential. This 
indicates that the heat is absorbed along 
AC and evolved along CB of the conductor 
as shown in Figure 2.37(a). Thus heat is 
transferred due to the current flow in the 
direction of the current. It is called positive 
Thomson effect. Similar effect is observed 
in metals like silver, zinc, and cadmium.
</p>
<p>When the copper bar is replaced by 
an iron bar, heat is evolved along CA and 
absorbed along BC. Thus heat is transferred 
due to the current flow in the direction 
opposite to the direction of current. It is 
called negative Thomson effect as shown in 
the Figure 2.37(b). Similar effect is observed 
in metals like platinum, nickel, cobalt, and 
mercury.
</p>
<p>2.	 This effect is utilized in automobiles as 
automotive thermoelectric generators 
for increasing fuel efficiency.
</p>
<p>3.	 Seebeck effect is used in 
thermocouples and thermopiles to 
measure the temperature difference 
between the two objects.
</p>
<p>2.7.2 Peltier effect
</p>
<p>In 1834, Peltier discovered that when 
an electric current is passed through a 
circuit of a thermocouple, heat is evolved 
at one junction and absorbed at the other 
junction. This is known as Peltier effect.

<p>In the Cu-Fe thermocouple the junctions 
A and B are maintained at the same 
temperature. Let a current from a battery 
flow through the thermocouple (Figure 2.36 
(a)). At the junction A, where the current 
flows from Cu to Fe, heat is absorbed and the 
junction A becomes cold. At the junction B, 
where the current flows from Fe to Cu heat 
is liberated and it becomes hot. When the 
direction of current is reversed, junction A

INTRODUCTION TO 
MAGNETISM
</p>
<p>Figure 3.1: Magnetic levitation
</p>
<p>Magnets! No doubt, their behaviour will 
attract everyone. The world enjoys their 
benefits, to lead a modern luxurious life. 
The study of magnets fascinated scientists 
around our globe for many centuries and 
even now, door for research on magnets is 
still open (Figure 3.1).
</p>
<p>Many birds and animals 
have magnetic sense in 
their eyes using Earth&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>magnetic field for navigation.
</p>
<p>Magnetic sensing in eyes - for Zebra 
finch bird, due to protein cryptochromes 
Cry4 present in retina; the bird uses 
Earth's magnetic field for navigation
</p>
<p>Magnetism exists everywhere from tiny 
particles like electrons to the entire universe. 
Historically the word &lsquo;magnetism&rsquo; was 
derived from iron ore magnetite (Fe3O4).  
In olden days, magnets were used as 
magnetic compass for navigation, magnetic 
therapy for treatment and also used in 
magic shows. 
</p>
<p>In modern days, many things we use in 
our daily life contain magnets (Figure 3.2).  
Motors, cycle dynamo, loudspeakers, 
magnetic tapes used in audio and video 
recording, mobile phones, head phones, CD, 
pen-drive, hard disc of laptop, refrigerator 
door, generator are a few examples.
</p>
<p>Earlier, both electricity and magnetism 
were thought to be two independent 
branches in physics. In 1820, H.C. Oersted 
observed the deflection of magnetic compass 
needle kept near a current carrying wire. 
This unified the two different branches, 
electricity and magnetism as a single subject 
&lsquo;electromagnetism&rsquo; in physics.
</p>
<p>In this unit, basics of magnets and 
their properties are given. Later, how a 
current carrying conductor (here only 
steady current, not time-varying current 
is considered) behaves like a magnet is 
presented.

<p>From the activities performed in lower 
classes, you might have noticed that the needle 
in a magnetic compass or freely suspended 
magnet comes to rest in a position which is 
approximately along the geographical north-
south direction of the Earth. 
</p>
<p>The north pole of magnetic compass 
needle is attracted towards the magnetic 
south pole of the Earth which is near the 
geographic north pole (Figure 3.3). Similarly, 
the south pole of magnetic compass needle is 
attracted towards the magnetic north-pole of 
the Earth which is near the geographic south 
pole. The branch of physics which deals 
with the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field is called 
Geomagnetism or Terrestrial magnetism. 
</p>
<p>There are three quantities required to 
specify the magnetic field of the Earth on its 
surface, which are often called as the elements 
of the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field. They are 
</p>
<p>(a) magnetic declination (D)
(b) magnetic dip or inclination (I)
(c)  the horizontal component of the 
</p>
<p>Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field (BH)

<p>Day and night occur because Earth spins 
about an axis called geographic axis. A vertical 
plane passing through the geographic axis is 
called geographic meridian and a great circle 
perpendicular to Earth&rsquo;s geographic axis is 
called geographic equator. 
</p>
<p>The straight line which connects magnetic 
poles of Earth is known as magnetic axis. 
</p>
<p>William Gilbert in 1600 
proposed that Earth itself 
behaves like a gigantic 
</p>
<p>powerful bar magnet. But this 
theory is not successful because the 
temperature inside the Earth is very 
high and so it will not be possible for 
a magnet to retain its magnetism. 
</p>
<p>Gover suggested that the Earth&rsquo;s 
magnetic field is due to hot rays coming 
out from the Sun. These rays will heat up 
the air near equatorial region. Once air 
becomes hotter, it rises above and will 
move towards northern and southern 
hemispheres and get electrified. This 
may be responsible to magnetize the 
ferromagnetic materials near the Earth&rsquo;s 
surface. Till date, so many theories 
have been proposed. But none of the 
theorium completely explains the cause 
for the Earth&rsquo;s magnetism.

<p>A vertical plane passing through magnetic 
axis is called magnetic meridian and a great 
circle perpendicular to Earth&rsquo;s magnetic axis 
is called magnetic equator. 
</p>
<p>When a magnetic needle is freely 
suspended, the alignment of the magnet 
does not exactly lie along the geographic 
meridian as shown in Figure 3.4. The angle 
between magnetic meridian at a point 
and geographical meridian is called the 
declination or magnetic declination (D). At 
higher latitudes, the declination is greater 
whereas near the equator, the declination is 
smaller. In India, declination angle is very 
small and for Chennai, magnetic declination 
angle is &ndash;1o 16ʹ (which is negative (west)). 
</p>
<p>The angle subtended by the Earth&rsquo;s 
total magnetic field 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>B with the horizontal 
direction in the magnetic meridian is 
called dip or magnetic inclination (I) 
at that point (Figure 3.5). For Chennai, 
inclination angle is 14o 28ʹ. The component 
of Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field along the 
horizontal direction in the magnetic 
meridian is called horizontal component 
of Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field, denoted by BH. 
</p>
<p>Let BE be the net Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field 
at any point on the surface of the Earth. 
BE can be resolved into two perpendicular 
components.

<p>Horizontal component BH = BE cos I (3.1)

The Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field is parallel to the

</p>
<p>BH = BE

<p>BV = 0

<p>This implies that the horizontal

<p>(ii) At magnetic poles
The Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field is

<p>Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis
People living at high latitude regions (near Arctic or Antarctic) might 
experience dazzling coloured natural lights across the night sky. This ethereal 
display on the sky is known as aurora borealis (northern lights) or aurora 
</p>
<p>australis (southern lights). These lights are often called as polar lights. The lights are seen above 
the magnetic poles of the northern and southern hemispheres. They are called as &ldquo;Aurora 
borealis&rdquo; in the north and &ldquo;Aurora australis&rdquo; in the south. This occurs as a result of interaction 
between the gaseous particles in the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere with highly charged particles released 
from the Sun&rsquo;s atmosphere through solar 
wind. These particles emit light due to 
collision and variations in colour are due 
to the type of the gas particles that take 
part in the collisions. A pale yellowish &ndash; 
green colour is produced when the ionized 
oxygen takes part in the collision and a blue 
or purplish &ndash; red aurora is produced due to 
ionized nitrogen molecules.

<p>3.1.2 Basic properties of 
magnets
</p>
<p>Some basic terminologies and properties 
used in describing bar magnet. 
</p>
<p>(a) Magnetic dipole moment
</p>
<p>Consider a bar magnet as shown in 
Figure 3.6. Let qm be the pole strength of 
the magnetic pole and let l be the distance 
between the geometrical centre of bar 
magnet O and one end of the pole. The 
magnetic dipole moment is defined as the 
product of its pole strength and magnetic 
length. It is a vector quantity, denoted  
by pm.

<p>d  is the vector drawn from south 
pole to north pole and its magnitude

<p>d l= 2 . 
</p>
<p>The magnitude of magnetic dipole 
moment is p q lm m= 2
</p>
<p>The SI unit of magnetic moment is A m2. 
The direction of magnetic moment is from 
south pole to north pole. 
</p>
<p>(b) Magnetic field
</p>
<p>Magnetic field is the region or space 
around every magnet within which its 
influence will be felt by keeping another 
magnet in that region. The magnetic field 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>B  
at a point is defined as a force experienced 
by the bar magnet of unit pole strength.

</p>
<p>Its unit is N A&ndash;1 m&ndash;1. 
(c) Types of magnets
</p>
<p>Magnets are classified into natural 
magnets and artificial magnets. For 
example, iron, cobalt, nickel, etc. are natural 
magnets. Strengths of natural magnets are 
very weak and the shapes of the magnet are 
irregular. Artificial magnets are made in 
order to have desired shape and strength. 
If the magnet is in the form of rectangular 
shape or cylindrical shape, then it is known 
as bar magnet. 
Properties of magnet
</p>
<p>The following are the properties of bar 
magnet (Figure 3.7),
1.  A freely suspended bar magnet will always 
</p>
<p>point along the north-south direction.
2.  A magnet attracts or repels another 
</p>
<p>magnet or magnetic substances towards 
itself. The attractive or repulsive force 
is  maximum near the end of the bar 
magnet. When a bar magnet is dipped 
into iron filling, they  cling to the ends of 
the magnet. 
</p>
<p>3.  When a magnet is broken into pieces, each 
piece behaves like a magnet with poles at 
its ends.
</p>
<p>4.  Two poles of a magnet have pole strength 
equal to one another. 
</p>
<p>5.  The length of the bar magnet is called 
geometrical length and the length between 
two magnetic  poles in a bar magnet is 
called magnetic length. Magnetic length 
is always slightly smaller than geometrical 
length. The ratio of magnetic length and 
geometrical length is 5

<p>(i) Pole strength is a scalar 
quantity with dimension 
[MoLToA]. Its SI unit is N T&ndash;1 
</p>
<p>(newton per tesla) or A m (ampere-metre).
(ii) Like positive and negative charges 
in electrostatics, north pole of a magnet 
experiences a force in the direction of magnetic 
field while south pole of a magnet experiences 
force opposite to the magnetic field. 
(iii) Pole strength depends on the nature 
of materials of the magnet, area of cross-
section and the state of magnetization.
(iv) If a magnet is cut into two equal halves 
along the length then pole strength is 
reduced to half. 
(v) If a magnet is cut into two equal halves 
perpendicular to the length, then pole 
strength remains same. 
(vi) If a magnet is cut into two pieces, we 
will not get separate north and south poles. 
Instead, we get two magnets. In other words, 
isolated monopole does not exist in nature.

</p>
<p>Magnetic field lines
</p>
<p>1.  Magnetic field lines are continuous closed 
curves. The direction of magnetic field lines 
is from North pole to South pole outside the 
magnet and from South pole to North pole 
inside the magnet. 
</p>
<p>2.  The direction of magnetic field at any point 
on the curve is known by drawing tangent 
to the magnetic field lines at that point. 
</p>
<p>3.  Magnetic field lines never intersect each 
other. Otherwise, the magnetic compass 
needle would point towards two different 
directions, which is not possible. 
</p>
<p>4.  The degree of closeness of the field lines 
determines the relative strength of the 
magnetic field. The magnetic field is 
strong where magnetic field lines crowd 
and weak where magnetic field lines are 
well separated. 
</p>
<p>(d) Magnetic flux
The number of magnetic field lines 
</p>
<p>crossing any area normally is defined 
as magnetic flux ΦB through the area.

a surface of area

<p>Special cases
</p>
<p>(a)  When 

</p>
<p>B is normal to the surface i.e., 
θ = 0o, the magnetic flux is ΦB = BA

</p>
<p>(b)  When 

</p>
<p>B is parallel to the surface i.e.,  
θ = 90o, the magnetic flux is ΦB = 0.

can be written as

</p>
<p>Magnetic flux is a scalar quantity. The 
SI unit for magnetic flux is weber, which 
is denoted by symbol Wb. Dimensional 
formula for magnetic flux is ML T A2 2 1&minus; &minus;  . 
The CGS unit of magnetic flux is maxwell. 
</p>
<p>1 weber = 108 maxwell 
</p>
<p>The magnetic flux density is defined 
as the number of magnetic field lines 
crossing per unit area kept normal to 
the direction of lines of force. Its unit is  
Wb m&ndash;2 or tesla (T).

</p>
<p>Non-uniform magnetic field

at different points in a region. Example:

<p>This is similar to Gauss&rsquo;s law in 
electrostatics.

COULOMB&rsquo;S INVERSE 
SQUARE LAW OF 
MAGNETISM
</p>
<p>Consider two bar magnets A and B as 
shown in Figure 3.11. When the north pole 
of magnet A and the north pole of magnet 
B or the south pole of magnet A and the 
south pole of magnet B are brought closer, 
they repel each other. 
</p>
<p>On the other hand, when the north pole 
of magnet A and the south pole of magnet 
B or the south pole of magnet A and the 
north pole of magnet B are brought closer, 
their poles attract each other.
</p>
<p>This looks similar to Coulomb&rsquo;s 
law for static charges studied in Unit&nbsp; I 
(opposite charges attract and like 
charges repel each other). So analogous 
to Coulomb&rsquo;s law in electrostatics, we 
can state Coulomb&rsquo;s law for magnetism 
(Figure 3.12) as follows:

<p>Consider a magnetic dipole which

another anti-parallel to magnetic field.

<p>Let pm be the dipole and before switching

<p>(c) Intensity of magnetisation
</p>
<p>Any bulk material (any object of finite 
size) contains a large number of atoms. Each 
atom consists of electrons which undergo 
orbital motion. Due to orbital motion, 
electron has magnetic moment which is a 
vector quantity. In general, these magnetic 
moments orient randomly, therefore, the net 
magnetic moment is zero per unit volume of 
the material.
</p>
<p>When such a material is kept in an 
external magnetic field, atomic dipoles are 
induced and hence, they will try to align 
partially or fully along the direction of 
external field. The net magnetic moment 
per unit volume of the material is known 
as intensity of magnetisation. It is a vector 
quantity. Mathematically,

<p>MAGNETIC PROPERTIES
</p>
<p>All materials are not magnetic in 
nature. Further, all the magnetic materials 
will not behave identically. So, in order to 
differentiate one magnetic material from 
another, some basic parameters are used. 
They are: 
</p>
<p>(a) Magnetising field
The magnetic field which is used to 
</p>
<p>magnetize a sample or specimen is called 
the magnetising field. Magnetising field is 
a vector quantity and is denoted by 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>H  and 
its unit is A m&ndash;1. 
</p>
<p>(b) Magnetic permeability
The magnetic permeability is the 
</p>
<p>measure of ability of the material to 
allow the passage of magnetic field lines 
through it or measure of the capacity of 
the substance to take magnetisation or 
the degree of penetration of magnetic 
field through the substance.
</p>
<p>In free space, the permeability (or 
absolute permeability) is denoted by &micro;0 
and for any other medium it is denoted by 
&micro;.The relative permeability &micro;r is defined as 
the ratio between absolute permeability 
of the medium to the permeability of free 
space.
</p>
<p>�
�
�r �

</p>
<p> (3.29)
</p>
<p>Relative permeability is a dimensionless 
number and has no units. For free space 
(air or vacuum), the relative permeability is 
unity i.e., &micro;r = 1.

</p>
<p>CLASSIFICATION OF 
MAGNETIC MATERIALS
</p>
<p>The magnetic materials are generally 
classified into three types based on their 
behaviour in a magnetising field. They 
are diamagnetic, paramagnetic and 
ferromagnetic materials.
</p>
<p>(a) Diamagnetic materials
The orbital motion of electrons around 
</p>
<p>the nucleus produces a magnetic field 
perpendicular to the plane of the orbit. 
Thus each electron orbit has finite orbital 
magnetic dipole moment. Since the orbital 
planes of the other electrons are oriented in 
random manner, the vector sum of magnetic 
moments is zero and there is no resultant 
magnetic moment for each atom. 
</p>
<p>In the presence of a uniform external 
magnetic field, some electrons are speeded 
up and some are slowed down. The electrons 
whose moments were anti-parallel are 
speeded up according to Lenz&rsquo;s law and this 
produces an induced magnetic moment in a 
direction opposite to the field. The induced 
moment disappears as soon as the external 
field is removed. 
</p>
<p>When placed in a non-uniform magnetic 
field, the interaction between induced 
magnetic moment and the external field 
creates a force which tends to move the 
material from stronger part to weaker part of 
the external field. It means that diamagnetic 
material is repelled by the field. 
</p>
<p>This action is called diamagnetic action 
and such materials are known as diamagnetic 
materials. Examples: Bismuth, Copper and 
Water etc.
</p>

<p>Two materials X and Y are magnetised 
whose values of intensity of magnetisation 
are 500 A m&ndash;1 and 2000 A m&ndash;1 respectively.  
If the magnetising field is 1000 A m&ndash;1, then 
which one among these materials can be 
easily magnetized?.

material Y can be easily magnetized.

</p>
<p>In the presence of an external 
magnetic field, the torque acting on the 
atomic dipoles will align them in the field 
direction. As a result, there is net magnetic 
dipole moment induced in the direction 
of the applied field. The induced dipole 
moment is present as long as the external 
field exists.
</p>
<p>When placed in a non-uniform 
magnetic field, the paramagnetic 
materials will have a tendency to move 
from weaker to stronger part of the field. 
Materials which exhibit weak magnetism 
in the direction of the applied field 
are known as paramagnetic materials. 
</p>
<p>The properties of diamagnetic materials 
are 
i)  Magnetic susceptibility is negative.
ii)  Relative permeability is slightly less than 
</p>
<p>unity.
iii)  The magnetic field lines are repelled or 
</p>
<p>expelled by diamagnetic materials when 
placed in a magnetic field.
</p>
<p>iv)  Susceptibility is nearly temperature 
independent.
</p>
<p>Superconductors are perfect 
diamagnetic materials. 
The expulsion of magnetic 
</p>
<p>flux from a superconductor during its 
transition to the superconducting state is 
known as Meissner effect. (see figure 3.18)

</p>
<p>(b) Paramagnetic materials
In some magnetic materials, each atom or 
</p>
<p>molecule has net magnetic dipole moment 
which is the vector sum of orbital and spin 
magnetic moments of electrons. Due to 
the random orientation of these magnetic 
moments, the net magnetic moment of the 
materials is zero.
</p>
<p>Magnetic levitated train
Magnetic levitated train 
</p>
<p>is also called Maglev train. 
This train floats few centimetres above 
the guideway because of electromagnet 
used. Maglev train does not need wheels 
and also achieve greater speed. The basic 
mechanism of working of Maglev train 
involves two sets of magnets. One set is 
used to repel which makes train to float 
above the track and another set is used to 
move the floating train ahead at very great 
speed. These trains are quieter, smoother 
and environmental friendly compared 
conventional trains and have potential 
for moving with much higher speeds with 
technology in future.

</p>
<p>The properties of paramagnetic materials 
are: 
i)  Magnetic susceptibility is positive and 
</p>
<p>small.
ii)  Relative permeability is greater than 
</p>
<p>unity.
iii)  The magnetic field lines are attracted 
</p>

</p>
<p>iv)  Susceptibility is inversely proportional 
to temperature.
</p>
<p>Curie&rsquo;s law 
When temperature is increased, thermal 
</p>
<p>vibration will upset the alignment of 
magnetic dipole moments. Therefore, the 
magnetic susceptibility decreases with 
increase in temperature. In many cases, the 
susceptibility of the materials is

</p>
<p>This relation is called Curie&rsquo;s law. Here

<p>(c) Ferromagnetic materials
An atom or a molecule in a ferromagnetic 
</p>
<p>material possesses net magnetic dipole 
moment as in a paramagnetic material. 
A ferromagnetic material is made up of 
smaller regions, called ferromagnetic 
domains (Figure 3.20). Within each 
domain, the magnetic moments are 
spontaneously aligned in a direction. This 
alignment is caused by strong interaction 
arising from electron spin which depends 
on the inter-atomic distance. Each domain 
has net magnetisation in a direction. 
However the direction of magnetisation 
varies from domain to domain and  
thus net magnetisation of the specimen is 
zero.
</p>

(a) Domains randomly

(b) Domains aligned with
</p>

</p>
<p>Figure 3.20 Magnetic domains &ndash; 
ferromagnetic materials
</p>
<p>In the presence of external magnetic 
field, two processes take place 
</p>
<p>(1)  The domains having magnetic moments 
parallel to the field grow bigger in size 
</p>
<p>(2)  The other domains (not parallel to field)
are rotated so that they are aligned with 
the field. 
</p>
<p>As a result of these mechanisms, 
there is a strong net magnetisation of the 
material in the direction of the applied field  
(Figure 3.21).

<p>Magnetism plays interesting 
role in various aspects of life. It has 
</p>
<p>connection with archeological place Keezhadi too. 
To find whether any archeological structure exists 
under the surface of a given place, well established 
technique called &lsquo;magnetometer surveying&rsquo; is used.
</p>
<p>In this technique, the variation of 
the magnetic field in comparison with 
the neighbouring place is studied. The 
magnetic field variation is due to the 
presence of magnetic mineral magnetite 
and its related minerals present in the 
archeological structures like buried wall, 
pottery, bricks, buried tombs, monuments 
and inhabited sites. Those minerals are 
either diamagnetic or paramagnetic or 
ferromagnetic in nature and each type has 
different range of magnetic susceptibilities. 
</p>
<p>Indian Institute of Geomagnetism (IIG), Mumbai conducted magnetometer survey on 
Keezhadi site and found out that there were archeological structures like wall, pottery etc. 
From the picture (Figure 1), there was magnetic field variation in the range of 10 to 100nT 
over the particular area (coloured portion). In fact, the existence of massive brick structures at 
Keezhadi has been revealed through magnetism (Figure 2).

<p>Curie-Weiss law
As temperature increases, the 
</p>
<p>ferromagnetism decreases due to the 
increased thermal agitation of the atomic 
dipoles. At a particular temperature, 
ferromagnetic material becomes 
paramagnetic. This temperature is known 
as Curie temperature TC . The susceptibility 
of the material above the Curie temperature 
is given by

</p>
<p>This relation is called Curie-Weiss law. 
The constant C is called Curie constant and 
temperature T is in kelvin scale. A plot of 
magnetic susceptibility with temperature is 
as shown in Figure 3.22.

<p>Spin
Like mass and charge for 
particles, spin is also another 
</p>
<p>important attribute for an elementary 
particle. Spin is a quantum mechanical 
phenomenon which is responsible for 
magnetic properties of the material. 
Spin in quantum mechanics is entirely 
different from spin we encounter in 
classical mechanics. Spin in quantum 
mechanics does not mean rotation; it 
is intrinsic angular momentum which 
does not have classical analogue. For 
historical reason, the name spin is 
retained. Spin of a particle takes only 
positive values but the orientation of the 
spin vector takes plus or minus values 
in an external magnetic field. For an 
</p>
<p>example, electron has spin s = 1
2
</p>
<p>. In the 
</p>
<p>presence of magnetic field, the spin will 
orient either parallel or anti-parallel to 
the direction of magnetic field.

<p> (spin up) and ms = &minus; 1

<p>HYSTERESIS
</p>
<p>When a ferromagnetic material is kept 
in a magnetising field, the material gets 
magnetised by induction. An important 
characteristic of ferromagnetic material is 
that the variation of magnetic induction 

</p>
<p>B  with magnetising field 

</p>
<p>H  is not linear. 
</p>
<p>It means that the ratio B
H
</p>
<p>= &micro; is not a 
</p>
<p>constant. Let us study this behaviour in 
detail.
</p>
<p>A ferromagnetic material (example, 
Iron) is magnetised slowly by a magnetising 
field 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>H . The magnetic induction 


material increases from point A with

<p>Hysteresis loss
During the magnetisation of the 
</p>
<p>specimen through a cycle, there is loss of 
energy in the form of heat. This loss is 
attributed to the rotation and orientation 
of molecular magnets in various 
directions. It is found that the energy lost 
(or dissipated) per unit volume of the 
material when it is carried through one 
cycle of magnetisation is equal to the area 
of the hysteresis loop.  
</p>
<p>Hard and soft magnetic materials
Based on the shape and size of 
</p>
<p>the hysteresis loop, ferromagnetic 
materials are classified as soft magnetic 
materials with smaller area and hard 
magnetic materials with larger area. 
The comparison of the hysteresis loops 
for two magnetic materials is shown in 
Figure 3.24. Properties of soft and hard 
magnetic materials are compared in 
Table 3.2.

<p>Figure 3.24 Comparison of two 
ferromagnetic materials based on 
hysteresis loop
</p>
<p>If the magnetising field is now reduced, 
the magnetic induction also decreases 
but does not retrace the original path 
CA. It takes different path CD. When the 
magnetising field is zero, the magnetic 
induction is not zero and it has positive 
value. This implies that some magnetism 
is left in the specimen even when  
H = 0. The residual magnetism AD present 
in the specimen is called remanence or 
retentivity. Remanence is defined as 
the ability of the materials to retain 
the magnetism in them even after the  
magnetising field disappears.
</p>
<p>In order to demagnetise the material, 
the magnetising field is gradually 
increased in the reverse direction. Now the 
magnetic induction decreases along DE 
and becomes zero at E. The magnetising 
field AE in the reverse direction is required 
to bring residual magnetism to zero. The 
magnitude of the reverse magnetising 
field for which the residual magnetism 
of the material vanishes is called its 
coercivity. 
</p>
<p>Further increase of 

</p>
<p>H  in the reverse 
direction causes the magnetic induction 
to increase along EF until it reaches 
saturation at F in the reverse direction. If 
magnetising field is decreased and then 
increased with direction reversed, the 
magnetic induction traces the path FGKC. 
This closed curve ACDEFGKC is called 
hysteresis loop and it corresponds to one 
cycle of magnetisation. 
</p>
<p>In the entire cycle, the magnetic 
induction B lags behind the magnetising 
field H. This phenomenon of lagging 
of magnetic induction behind the 
magnetising field is called hysteresis. 
Hysteresis means &lsquo;lagging behind&rsquo;.

<p>Applications of hysteresis loop
The significance of hysteresis loop is that 
</p>
<p>it provides information such as retentivity, 
coercivity, permeability, susceptibility and 
energy loss during one cycle of magnetisation 
for each ferromagnetic material. Therefore, 
the study of hysteresis loop will help us in 
selecting proper and suitable material for a 
given purpose. Some examples:
</p>
<p>i) Permanent magnets:
The materials with high retentivity, high 
</p>
<p>coercivity and low permeability are suitable 
for making permanent magnets.
Examples: Carbon steel and Alnico
</p>
<p>ii) Electromagnets:
The materials with high initial 
</p>
<p>permeability, low retentivity, low coercivity 
and thin hysteresis loop with smaller area 
are preferred to make electromagnets.
</p>
<p>Examples: Soft iron and Mumetal (Nickel 
Iron alloy).

then the needle of the magnetic compass

at that point. Tracing out the direction 
shown by magnetic needle , we can draw 
the magnetic field lines at a distance.  
For a straight current-carrying conductor,

<p>MAGNETIC EFFECTS OF 
CURRENT 
</p>
<p>3.7.1 Oersted experiment
</p>
<p>In 1820 Hans Christian Oersted, 
while preparing for his lecture in physics, 
noticed that electric current passing 
through a wire deflects the nearby 
magnetic needle in the compass. By 
proper investigation, he observed that 
the deflection of magnetic needle is due 
to the change in magnetic field produced 
around current carrying conductor 
(Figure 3.25). When the direction of 
current is reversed, the magnetic needle is 
deflected in the opposite direction. This 
lead to the development of the theory 
&lsquo;electromagnetism&rsquo; which unifies two 
branches in physics namely, electricity 
and magnetism.

<p>The strength of the magnetic field is 
increased if either the current in the coil or 
the number of turns or both are increased. 
The polarity (north pole or south pole) 
depends on the direction of current in the 
loop.

<p>3.7.3 Right hand thumb rule
</p>
<p>The right hand rule is used to find 
the direction of magnetic field when the 
direction of current in a conductor is 
known. 
</p>
<p>The direction of circular magnetic field 
lines will be clockwise or anticlockwise 
depending on the direction of current in the 
conductor. If the strength (or magnitude) 
of the current is increased then the density 
of the magnetic field will also increase. The 
strength of the magnetic field (B) decreases as 
the distance (r) from the conductor increases 
(Figure 3.26 (b)).
</p>
<p>(b) Circular coil carrying current
Suppose we keep a magnetic compass 
</p>
<p>near a current carrying circular conductor, 
then the needle of the magnetic compass 
experiences a torque and deflects to align 
in the direction of the magnetic field at that 
point. We can notice that at the points A and 
B in the vicinity of the coil, the magnetic field 
lines are circular. The magnetic field lines are 
nearly parallel to each other near the centre 
of the loop, indicating that the field present 
near the centre of the coil is almost uniform 
(Figure 3.27).

<p>This rule can also be  used to find the

then the direction of current is same as 
the direction in which screw advances 
and the direction of rotation of the screw 
gives the direction of the magnetic field.

</p>
<p>Soon after Oersted&rsquo;s discovery, both 
Jean-Baptiste Biot and Felix Savart in 
1819 did quantitative experiments on the 
force experienced by a magnet kept near 
current carrying wire and arrived at a 
mathematical expression that gives the 
magnetic field at some point in space in 
terms of the current that produces the 
magnetic field. This is true for any shape 
of the conductor.

shown in Figure 3.33. 
</p>
<p>The magnetic field at a point P on the axis

<p>field. When the circuit is closed, the electric 
current will pass through the circular coil 
and produce magnetic field at the centre of 
the coil. Now there are two fields which are 
acting mutually perpendicular to each other. 
They are:
(1)  the magnetic field (B) due to the electric 
</p>
<p>current in the coil acting normal to the 
plane of the coil. 
</p>
<p>(2)  the horizontal component of Earth&rsquo;s

provided with two or more coils of different 
number of turns. Most of the equipments we 
use in laboratory, contains coils of 2 turns, 
5 turns and 50 turns which are of different 
thickness and are used for measuring currents 
of different strengths. 
</p>
<p>At the centre of turn table, there is a small 
upright projection on which a compass 
box is placed. Compass box consists of a 
small magnetic needle which is pivoted 
at its centre, such that the centres of both 
magnetic needle and circular coil exactly 
coincide. A thin aluminium pointer attached 
perpendicular to the magnetic needle moves 
over a graduated  circular scale. The circular 
scale is divided into four quadrants and they 
are graduated in degrees, each quadrant 
being numbered from 0&deg; to 90&deg; In order 
to avoid parallax error in measurement, 
a mirror is placed below the aluminium 
pointer. 
</p>
<p>Precautions
1.  All the nearby magnets and magnetic 
</p>
<p>materials are kept away from the instrument.
2.  Using spirit level, the levelling screws at 
</p>
<p>the base are adjusted so that the small 
magnetic needle is exactly horizontal 
and also coil (mounted on the frame) is 
exactly vertical. 
</p>
<p>3.  The plane of the coil is kept parallel to the 
small magnetic needle by rotating the coil 
about its  vertical axis. So that, the coil 
remains in magnetic meridian.
</p>
<p>4.  The compass box  alone is rotated such 
that the aluminium pointer reads 0o &ndash; 0o.
</p>
<p>Theory
In the tangent galvanometer experiment, 
</p>
<p>when no current is passed through the 
coil, the small magnetic needle lies along 
horizontal component of Earth&rsquo;s magnetic

</p>
<p>This implies that a current carrying 
circular loop behaves as a magnetic dipole 
of magnetic moment pm . So, the magnetic 
dipole moment of any current loop is 
equal to the product of the current and 
area of the loop.

In order to determine the direction of

rule which states that

<p>Solenoid
A solenoid is a long coil of wire closely 
</p>
<p>wound in the form of helix as shown in 
Figure 3.38. When electric current is 
passed through the solenoid, the magnetic 
field is produced. The magnetic field of 
the solenoid is due to the superposition 
of magnetic fields of each turn of the 
solenoid. The direction of magnetic field 
due to solenoid is given by right hand 
palm-rule. 
</p>
<p>Inside the solenoid, the magnetic field 
is nearly uniform and parallel to its axis 
whereas, outside the solenoid the field is 
negligibly small. Based on the direction of 
the current, one end of the solenoid behaves 
like North Pole and the other end behaves 
like South Pole.
</p>
<p>The current carrying solenoid is held 
in right hand. If the fingers curl in the 
direction of current, then extended thumb 
gives the direction of magnetic field of 
current carrying solenoid. It is shown in 
</p>
<p>the direction of magnetic field lines is 
shown in Figure 3.37. Since the wire is 
geometrically cylindrical in shape and 
symmetrical about its axis, we construct 
an Amp&egrave;rian loop in the form of a circular 
shape at a distance r from the centre of the 
conductor as shown in Figure 3.37. From 
the Amp&egrave;re&rsquo;s law, we get

<p>The solenoid is assumed to be long 
which means that the length of the solenoid 
is large when compared to its diameter. The 
winding need not to be always circular, it 
can also be in other shapes. We consider 
here only circularly wound solenoid as 
shown in Figure 3.40.

<p>3.9.3 Magnetic field due to a 
long current carrying solenoid

<p>Consider a solenoid of length L having 
N turns. The diameter of the solenoid 
is assumed to be much smaller when 
compared to its length and the coil is wound 
very closely.

<p>Since n is a constant for a given solenoid 
and μ0 is also constant. For a fixed current I, 
the magnetic field inside the solenoid is also 
a constant. 
</p>
<p>Solenoid can be used as 
electromagnet. It produces 
strong magnetic field that 
</p>
<p>can be turned ON or OFF. This is not 
possible in case of permanent magnet. 
Further the strength of the magnetic 
field can be increased by keeping iron 
bar inside the solenoid. This is because 
the magnetic field of the solenoid 
magnetizes the iron bar and hence 
the net magnetic field is the sum of 
magnetic field of the solenoid and 
magnetic field of magnetised iron. 
Because of these properties, solenoids 
are useful in designing variety of 
electrical appliances.

<p>Calculate the magnetic field inside a

<p>(c)  the number of turns becomes twice for

</p>
<p>A solenoid is bent in such a way its ends 
are joined together to form a closed ring 
shape, is called a toroid which is shown in 
Figure 3.42. The magnetic field has constant 
magnitude inside the toroid whereas in the 
interior region (say, at point P) and exterior 
region (say, at point Q), the magnetic field

<p>Equations (3.60) and (3.61) are called as 
cyclotron frequency or gyro-frequency. 
</p>
<p>From equations (3.59), (3.60) and (3.61), 
we infer that time period and frequency 
depend only on charge-to-mass ratio 
(specific charge) but not on velocity or the 
radius of the circular path.
</p>
<p>If a charged particle moves in a region of 
uniform magnetic field such that its velocity 
is not perpendicular to the magnetic field, 
then the velocity of the particle is split up 
into two components; one component 
is parallel to the field while the other 
component perpendicular to the field. 
The component of velocity parallel to field 
remains unchanged and the component 
perpendicular to the field keeps changing 
due to Lorentz force. Hence the path of the 
particle is not a circle; it is a helical around 
the field lines as shown in Figure 3.46.

<p>Let us consider an experimental

of space between the parallel plates of a 
capacitor which produce uniform electric 
field 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>E , a uniform magnetic field 

</p>
<p>B is 
maintained perpendicular to the direction 
of electric field. 
</p>
<p>Suppose a charged particle with 
charge q enters the space from left side 
with a velocity v , the net force on the 
particle is

<p>Note that even though the difference 
between mass of two isotopes are very small, 
this arrangement helps us to convert this 
small difference into an easily measurable 
distance of separation. This arrangement 
is known as mass spectrometer. A mass 
spectrometer is used in many areas in 
sciences, especially in medicine, in space 
science, in geology etc. For example, in 
medicine, anaesthesiologists use it to 
measure the respiratory gases and biologist 
use it to determine the reaction mechanisms 
in photosynthesis.

<p>3.10.4 Cyclotron
</p>
<p>Cyclotron (Figure 3.49) is a device used 
to accelerate the charged particles to gain 
large kinetic energy. It is also called as 
high energy accelerator. It was invented by 
Lawrence and Livingston in 1934. 
Principle 
</p>
<p>When a charged particle moves 
perpendicular to the magnetic field, it 
experiences magnetic Lorentz force. 
</p>
<p>Figure 3.49 Cyclotron invented by 
Lawrence and Livingston
</p>
<p>This means, for a given magnitude of  

</p>
<p>E- field and 

</p>
<p>B- field, the forces act only on the 
</p>
<p>particle moving with particular speed v

</p>
<p>=
E
B
</p>
<p>.  
</p>
<p>This speed is independent of mass and 
</p>
<p>charge. 
</p>
<p>By proper choice of 
electric and magnetic 
fields, the particle with 
particular speed can be 
selected. Such an arrangement of fields is 
called a velocity selector. 
</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 3.22
</p>
<p>Let E be the electric field of magnitude  
6.0 &times; 106 N C&ndash;1 and B be the magnetic 
field magnitude 0.83 T. Suppose an 
electron is accelerated with a potential 
of 200 V, will it show zero deflection?. If 
not, at what potential will it show zero 
deflection.
</p>
<p>Solution:
</p>
<p>Electric field, E = 6.0 &times; 106 N C&ndash;1 and 
magnetic field, B = 0.83 T. 
</p>
<p>Then 
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>When an electron goes with this velocity, it 
shows null deflection. Since the accelerating 
potential is 200 V, the electron acquires 
kinetic energy because of this accelerating 
potential. Hence,

towards D2 with a greater velocity. For this

<p>From the equation (3.63), the increase 
in velocity increases the radius of circular 
path. This process continues and hence 
the particle moves in spiral path of 
increasing radius. Once it reaches near 
the edge, it is taken out with the help 
of deflector plate and allowed to hit the 
target T. 
</p>
<p>The important condition in cyclotron 
operation is that when the frequency f 
at which the positive ion circulates 
in the magnetic field must be equal to 
the constant frequency of the electrical 
oscillator fosc . This is called resonance 
condition.

<p>Construction
The schematic diagram of a cyclotron 
</p>
<p>is shown in Figure 3.50. The particles are 
allowed to move in between two semi-
circular metal containers called Dees (hollow 
D - shaped objects). Dees are enclosed in an 
evacuated chamber and it is kept in a region 
with uniform magnetic field controlled by 
an electromagnet. The direction of magnetic 
field is normal to the plane of the Dees. The 
two Dees are kept separated with a gap and 
the source S (which ejects the particle to be 
accelerated) is placed at the centre in the 
gap between the Dees. Dees are connected 
to high frequency alternating potential 
difference. 
</p>
<p>Working
Let us assume that the ion ejected from 
</p>
<p>source S is positively charged. As soon as 
ion is ejected, it is accelerated towards a Dee 
(say, D1) which has negative potential at 
that time. Since the magnetic field is normal 
to the plane of the Dees, the ion moves in a  
circular path. After one semi-circular path 
inside D1, the ion reaches the gap between 
Dees. At this time, the polarities of the Dees

<p>Deutrons (bundles of one

(electrically neutral particle) cannot be 
accelerated by the cyclotron. When a 
deutron is bombarded with a beryllium 
target, a beam of high energy neutrons are 
produced. These high-energy neutrons are 
sent into the patient&rsquo;s cancerous region to 
break the bonds in the DNA of the cancer 
cells (killing the cells). This is used in 
treatment of fast-neutron cancer therapy.

<p>Working
Consider a single turn of the rectangular 
</p>
<p>coil PQRS whose length is l and breadth 
b. PQ = RS = l and QR = SP = b. Let I be 
the electric current flowing through the 
rectangular coil PQRS as shown in Figure 
3.60. The horse-shoe magnet has hemi - 
spherical magnetic poles which produces 
a radial magnetic field. Due to this radial 
field, the sides QR and SP are always parallel 
to the magnetic field B and experience 
no force. The sides PQ and RS are always 
perpendicular to the magnetic field 
and experience equal forces in opposite 
directions. Due to this, torque is produced. 
</p>
<p>For single turn, the deflecting torque is 
τ = bF = bBIl= (lb) BI = ABI
since area of the coil, A = lb 
For coil with N turns, we get 
</p>
<p>Special cases: 
(a) When θ = 90&deg;or the plane of the loop 
</p>
<p>is parallel to the magnetic field, the torque 
on the current loop is maximum.
</p>
<p>τmax = IAB
</p>
<p>(b) When θ = 0&deg;/180&deg; or the plane of the 
loop is perpendicular to the magnetic field, 
the torque on the current loop is zero.

<p>3.11.2 Moving coil 
galvanometer
</p>
<p>Moving coil galvanometer is a device 
which is used to detect the flow of current 
in an electrical circuit. 
</p>
<p>Principle When a current carrying loop 
is placed in a uniform magnetic field, it 
experiences a torque. 
</p>
<p>Construction 
A moving coil galvanometer consists 
</p>
<p>of a rectangular coil PQRS of insulated 
thin copper wire. The coil contains a 
large number of turns wound over a light 
metallic frame. A cylindrical soft-iron core 
is placed symmetrically inside the coil as 
shown in Figure 3.59. The rectangular coil 
is suspended freely between two pole pieces 
of a horse-shoe magnet.
</p>
<p>The upper end of the rectangular 
coil is attached to one end of fine strip of 
phosphor bronze and the lower end of the 
coil is connected to a hair spring which is 
also made up of phosphor bronze. In a fine 
suspension strip, a small plane mirror is 
attached in order to measure the deflection 
of the coil with the help of lamp and scale 
arrangement. The other end of the mirror is 
connected to a torsion head. In order to pass 
electric current through the galvanometer, 
the suspension strip and the spring are 
connected to terminals.

<p>τ = NABI (3.69)
</p>
<p>Due to this deflecting torque, the coil 
gets twisted and restoring torque (also 
known as restoring couple) is developed. 
Hence the moment of the  restoring torque is 
proportional to the amount of twist θ.Thus 
</p>
<p>τ = K θ (3.70)
</p>
<p>where K is the restoring couple per unit 
twist. 
</p>
<p>At equilibrium, the deflecting couple 
must be equal to the restoring couple. 
Therefore we get,

<p>where G K
NAB
</p>
<p>=  is called galvanometer 
</p>
<p>constant or current reduction factor of the 
galvanometer. 
</p>
<p>Since the suspended moving coil 
galvanometer is very sensitive, we have 
to handle with high care while doing 
experiments. Most of the galvanometer 
we use are pointer type moving coil 
galvanometer.

<p>Conversion of galvanometer into ammeter 
and voltmeter
</p>
<p>A galvanometer is very sensitive 
instrument to detect the current. It can 
be easily converted into ammeter and 
voltmeter. 
</p>
<p>Galvanometer to an Ammeter
</p>
<p>Ammeter is an instrument used to 
measure current flowing in the electrical 
circuit. The ammeter must offer low 
resistance such that it will not change the 
current passing through it. So ammeter is 
connected in series to measure the circuit 
current. 
</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 3.25
</p>
<p>The coil of a moving coil galvanometer has 
5 turns and each turn has an effective area 
of 2 &times; 10&ndash;2 m2. It is suspended in a magnetic 
field whose strength is 4 &times; 10&ndash;2 Wb m&ndash;2. If 
the torsional constant K of the suspension 
fibre is 4 &times; 10&ndash;9 N m deg&ndash;1. 
(a)  Find its current sensitivity in division 
</p>
<p>per micro - ampere. 
</p>
<p>(b)  Calculate the voltage sensitivity of the 
galvanometer for it to have full scale 
deflection of 50 divisions for 25 mV. 
</p>
<p>(c)  Compute the resistance of the 
galvanometer.

</p>
<p>I I Ig g  So,
</p>
<p>the deflection produced in the 
galvanometer is a measure of the current I 
passing through the circuit. 
</p>
<p>Shunt resistance is connected in parallel 
to galvanometer. Therefore, resistance 
of ammeter (Ra) can be determined by 
computing the effective resistance, which is

<p>Since, the shunt resistance is a very 
</p>
<p>low resistance and the ratio S
Rg
</p>
<p>is also 
</p>
<p>small. This means, Ra is also small, i.e., the 
resistance offered by the ammeter is small. 
So, when we connect ammeter in series, the 
ammeter will not change appreciably the 
current in the circuit. For an ideal ammeter, 
the resistance must be equal to zero. But in 
reality, the reading in ammeter is always 
less than the actual current in the circuit. 
Let Iideal be  the current measured by ideal 
ammeter and Iactual be the actual current 
in the circuit. Then, the percentage error  
in measuring a current through an ammeter 
is

<p>1.  An ammeter is a low resistance instrument 
and it is always connected in series to the

</p>
<p>2.  An ideal ammeter has zero resistance
</p>
<p>A galvanometer is converted into an 
ammeter by connecting a low resistance 
in parallel with the galvanometer. This low 
resistance is called shunt resistance S. The 
scale is now calibrated in ampere and the 
range of ammeter depends on the values of 
the shunt resistance.

resistance Rg through a path AGE and 
the remaining current (I &ndash; Ig) passes 
along the path ACDE through shunt 
resistance S. The value of shunt resistance 
is so adjusted that current Ig produces full 
scale deflection in the galvanometer. The 
potential difference across galvanometer 
is same as the potential difference across 
shunt resistance.

<p>total resistance
</p>
<p>Since the galvanometer and high 
resistance are connected in series, the total 
resistance or effective resistance in the 
circuit is the sum of their resistances. This 
gives the resistance of voltmeter. Thus the 
voltmeter resistance is

<p>The deflection in the galvanometer is 
proportional to current Ig. But current Ig 
is proportional to the potential difference. 
Hence the deflection in the galvanometer 
is a measure of potential difference. Since 
the resistance of voltmeter is very large, 
a voltmeter connected in parallel in an 
electrical circuit will draw least current in the 
circuit. An ideal voltmeter is one which has 
infinite resistance. 
</p>
<p>Key points
1.  Voltmeter is a high resistance instrument 
</p>
<p>and it is always connected in parallel 
with the circuit element across which the 
potential difference is to be measured.
</p>
<p>2.  An ideal voltmeter has infinite resistance
</p>
<p>3.  In order to increase the range of voltmeter 
n times the value of resistance to be 
connected in series with galvanometer is 
</p>
<p>Rh = (n-1) Rg

<p>Galvanometer to a voltmeter
</p>
<p>A voltmeter is an instrument used to 
measure potential difference across any two 
points in the electrical circuits. It should not 
draw any current from the circuit otherwise 
the value of potential difference to be 
measured will change. 
</p>
<p>Voltmeter must have high resistance 
and when it is connected in parallel, it will 
not draw appreciable current so that it will 
indicate the true potential difference.

<p>A galvanometer is converted into a 
voltmeter by connecting high resistance Rh 
in series with galvanometer as shown in 
Figure 3.62. The scale is now calibrated in 
volt and the range of voltmeter depends on 
the values of the resistance Rh connected 
in series i.e. the value of resistance is so 
adjusted so that current Ig produces full 
scale deflection in the galvanometer. 
</p>
<p>Let Rg be the resistance of galvanometer 
and Ig be the current with which the 
galvanometer produces full scale deflection. 
Since the galvanometer is connected in 
series with high resistance, the current in 
the electrical circuit is same as the current 
passing through the galvanometer.

<p>&ldquo;Nature is our kindest friend and best critic in experimental science if we only allow her 
intimations to fall unbiased on our minds&rdquo;&nbsp;―&nbsp;Michael Faraday
</p>
<p>Learning Objectives
</p>
<p>4.1.1 Introduction
In the previous chapter, we have learnt 
</p>
<p>that whenever an electric current flows 
through a conductor, it produces a magnetic 
field around it. This was discovered by 
Christian Oersted. Later, Ampere proved 
that a current-carrying loop behaves like a 
bar magnet. These are the magnetic effects 
produced by the electric current.
</p>
<p>4.1
ELECTROMAGNETIC 
INDUCTION
</p>
<p>Physicists then began to think of the 
converse effect. Is it possible to produce an 
electric current with the help of a magnetic 
field? A series of experiments were 
conducted to establish the converse effect. 
These experiments were done by Michael 
Faraday of UK and Joseph Henry of USA, 
almost simultaneously and independently. 
These attempts became successful and 
led to the discovery of the phenomenon, 
called Electromagnetic Induction. Michael 
Faraday is credited with the discovery of 
electromagnetic induction in 1831.

<p>If the magnetic field B
��
</p>
<p> is uniform over 
the area A and is perpendicular to the area 
as shown in Figure 4.1(b), then the above 
equation becomes

</p>
<p>The SI unit of magnetic flux is T m2. It is 
also measured in weber or Wb.
</p>
<p>1 Wb = 1 T m2
</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 4.1
</p>
<p>A circular antenna of area 3 m2 is installed 
at a place in Madurai. The plane of the 
area of antenna is inclined at 47o with the 
direction of Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field. If the 
magnitude of Earth&rsquo;s field at that place is 
4.1 &times; 10&ndash;5 T find the magnetic flux linked 
with the antenna.
</p>
<p>Solution
</p>
<p>B = 4.1 &times; 10&ndash;5 T; θ = 90o &ndash; 47o = 43&deg;;  
A = 3m2
</p>
<p>In this chapter, let us see a few 
experiments of Faraday, the results and the 
phenomenon of Electromagnetic Induction. 
Before that, we will recollect the concept of 
magnetic flux linked with a surface area.
</p>
<p>An anecdote!
</p>
<p>Michael Faraday was enormously 
popular for his lectures as well. In 
one of his lectures, he demonstrated 
his experiments which led to 
the discovery of electromagnetic 
induction. 
</p>
<p>At the end of the lecture, one 
member of the audience approached 
Faraday and said, &ldquo;Mr. Faraday, the 
behaviour of the magnet and the coil 
of wire was interesting, but what is the 
use of it?&rdquo;&nbsp; Faraday answered politely, 
&ldquo;Sir, what is the use of a newborn 
baby?&rdquo;
Note: We will soon see the greatness 
of &lsquo;that little child&rsquo; who has now 
grown as an adult to cater to the 
energy needs.
</p>
<p>4.1.2 Magnetic Flux (FB)
</p>
<p>The magnetic flux FB through an area A 
in a magnetic field is defined as the number 
of magnetic field lines passing through that 
area normally and is given by the equation 
(Figure 4.1(a)).

A and θ is the angle between the direction of 
the magnetic field and the outward normal

on Electromagnetic Induction
</p>
<p>First Experiment
Consider a closed circuit consisting of a 
</p>
<p>coil C of insulated wire and a galvanometer 
G (Figure 4.2(a)). The galvanometer does 
not indicate deflection as there is no electric 
current in the circuit.
</p>
<p>When a bar magnet is inserted into the 
stationary coil, with its north pole facing the 
coil, there is a momentary deflection in the 
galvanometer. This indicates that an electric 
current is set up in the coil (Figure 4.2(b)).

</p>
<p>When the electric current becomes zero, the 
galvanometer shows no deflection.
</p>
<p>From the above observations, it is 
concluded that whenever the electric 
current in the primary circuit changes, the 
galvanometer shows a deflection.
</p>
<p>Faraday&rsquo;s Law of Electromagnetic 
Induction
</p>
<p>From the results of his experiments, 
Faraday realized that 
whenever the magnetic flux linked 
with a closed coil changes, an emf 
(electromotive force) is induced and 
hence an electric current flows in 
the circuit. This current is called an 
induced current and the emf giving rise 
to such current is called an induced 
emf. This phenomenon is known as 
electromagnetic induction. 
</p>
<p>coil, the galvanometer does not indicate 
deflection (Figure 4.2(c)). 
</p>
<p>The bar magnet is now withdrawn from 
the coil, the galvanometer again gives a 
momentary deflection but in the opposite 
direction. So the electric current flows in 
opposite direction (Figure 4.2(d)). Now if 
the magnet is moved faster, it gives a larger 
deflection due to a greater current in the 
circuit (Figure 4.2(e))
</p>
<p>The bar magnet is reversed i.e., the south 
pole now faces the coil. When the above 
experiment is repeated, the deflections are 
opposite to that obtained in the case of north 
pole (Figure 4.2(f)).
</p>
<p>If the magnet is kept stationary and the 
coil is moved towards or away from the coil, 
similar results are obtained. It is concluded 
that whenever there is a relative motion 
between the coil and the magnet, there is 
deflection in the galvanometer, indicating 
the electric current setup in the coil.
</p>
<p>Second Experiment
Consider two closed circuits as shown 
</p>
<p>in Figure 4.3(a). The circuit consisting of a 
coil P, a battery B and a key K is called as 
primary circuit while the circuit with a coil S 
and a galvanometer G is known as secondary 
circuit. The coils P and S are kept at rest in 
close proximity with respect to one another.
</p>
<p>If the primary circuit is closed, electric 
current starts flowing in the primary circuit. 
At that time, the galvanometer gives a 
momentary deflection (Figure 4.3(a)). 
</p>
<p>After that, when the electric current 
reaches a certain steady value, no deflection 
is observed in the galvanometer.  
</p>
<p>Likewise if the primary circuit is broken, 
the electric current starts decreasing and 
there is again a sudden deflection but in 
the opposite direction (Figure 4.3(b)).

</p>
<p>direction and hence an electric current flows 
in opposite direction (Figure 4.4(b)). So there 
is deflection in the galvanometer when there 
is a relative motion between the coil and the 
magnet.
</p>
<p>In the second experiment, when the 
primary coil P carries an electric current, a 
magnetic field is established around it. The 
magnetic lines of this field pass through 
itself and the neighbouring secondary coil S.
</p>
<p>When the primary circuit is open, no 
electric current flows in it and hence the 
magnetic flux linked with the secondary 
coil is zero (Figure 4.5(a)).

<p>Figure 4.4 Explanation of Faraday&rsquo;s first experiment
</p>
<p>Based on this idea, Faraday&rsquo;s experiments 
are understood in the following way. In the 
first experiment, when a bar magnet is placed 
close to a coil, some of the magnetic field 
lines of the bar magnet pass through the coil 
i.e., the magnetic flux is linked with the coil. 
When the bar magnet and the coil approach 
each other, the magnetic flux linked with the 
coil increases. So this increase in magnetic 
flux induces an emf and hence a transient 
electric current flows in the circuit in one 
direction (Figure 4.4(a)). 
</p>
<p>At the same time, when they recede away 
from one another, the magnetic flux linked 
with the coil decreases. The decrease in 
magnetic flux again induces an emf in opposite

<p>magnetic field around the primary coil. 
Therefore, the magnetic flux linked with the 
secondary coil increases. This increasing flux 
linked induces a transient electric current in 
the secondary coil (Figure 4.5(b)). When the 
electric current in the primary coil reaches a 
steady value, the magnetic flux linked with 
the secondary coil does not change and the 
electric current in the secondary coil will 
disappear.

broken, the decreasing primary current

<p>induces an electric current in the secondary 
coil, but in the opposite direction (Figure 
4.5(c)). So there is deflection in the 
galvanometer whenever there is a change in 
the primary current. 
</p>
<p>The conclusions of Faraday&rsquo;s experiments 
are stated as two laws.
</p>
<p>First law
 Whenever magnetic flux linked with 
a closed circuit changes, an emf is 
induced in the circuit which lasts in 
the circuit as long as the magnetic flux 
is changing.
</p>
<p>Second law
 The magnitude of induced emf in a 
closed circuit is equal to the time rate 
of change of magnetic flux linked with 
the circuit.
</p>
<p>If the magnetic flux linked with each 
turn of the coil changes by dΦB in a time 
dt, then the induced emf in each turn is 
given by 
</p>
<p>ε=
d
</p>
<p>dt
BΦ
</p>
<p>If a coil consisting of N turns is tightly 
wound such that each turn covers the same 
area, then the flux through each turn will be 
the same. Then total emf induced in the coil 
is given by

<p>Here NΦB is called flux linkage, defined 
as the product of number of turns N of the 
coil and the magnetic flux linking each turn 
of the coil ΦB.

<p>EXAMPLE 4.3
</p>
<p>A cylindrical bar magnet is kept along the 
axis of a circular solenoid. If the magnet is 
rotated about its axis, find out whether an 
electric current is induced in the coil.
Solution
</p>
<p>The magnetic field of a cylindrical magnet is 
symmetrical about its axis. As the magnet is 
rotated along the axis of the solenoid, there is 
no induced current in the solenoid because 
the flux linked with the solenoid does not 
change due to the rotation of the magnet.

to a position perpendicular to the field in a

<p>Importance of Electromagnetic 
Induction!
</p>
<p>The application of the phenomenon 
of Electromagnetic Induction is almost 
everywhere in the present day life. Right 
from home appliances to huge factory 
machineries, from cellphone to computers 
and internet, from electric guitar to satellite 
communication, all need electricity for 
their operation. There is an ever growing 
demand for electric power. 
</p>
<p>All these are met with the help of 
electric generators and transformers which 
function on electromagnetic induction. 
The modern, sophisticated human 
life would not be possible without the 
discovery of electromagnetic induction.

</p>
<p>Consider a uniform magnetic field, with 
its field lines perpendicular to the plane of 
the paper and pointing inwards. These field 
lines are represented by crosses (&times;) as shown 
in Figure 4.6(a). A rectangular metallic 
frame ABCD is placed in this magnetic field, 
</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 4.5
</p>
<p>A straight conducting wire is dropped 
horizontally from a certain height with its 
length along east &ndash; west direction. Will an 
emf be induced in it? Justify your answer.
</p>
<p>Solution
</p>
<p>Yes! An emf will be induced in the wire 
because it moves perpendicular to the 
horizontal component of Earth&rsquo;s magnetic 
field and hence it cuts the magnetic lines of 
Earth's magnetic filed.
</p>
<p>4.1.4 Lenz&rsquo;s law
</p>
<p>A German physicist Heinrich Lenz 
performed a series of experiments on 
electromagnetic induction and deduced a 
law to determine the direction of the induced 
current. This law is known as Lenz&rsquo;s law. 
</p>
<p>Lenz&rsquo;s law states that the direction of 
the induced current is such that it always 
opposes the cause responsible for its 
production.
</p>
<p>Faraday discovered that whenever 
magnetic flux linked with a coil changes, an 
electric current is induced in the circuit. Here 
the flux change is the cause while the induction 
of current is the effect. Lenz&rsquo;s law says that the 
effect always opposes the cause. Therefore, the 
induced current would flow in a direction so 
that it could oppose the flux change.
</p>
<p>By incorporating Lenz's law into Faraday's 
law, the equation (4.2) is rewritten as
</p>
<p>ε=&minus;
d N
</p>
<p>dt
B( )Φ  (4.3)
</p>
<p>The negative sign signifies that the 
direction of induced emf is such that it 
opposes the change in magnetic flux.

the number of field lines (magnetic flux) 
passing through the frame ABCD increases 
and a current is induced. As suggested by 
Lenz&rsquo;s law, the induced current opposes 
this flux increase and it tries to reduce it by 
producing another magnetic field pointing 
outwards i.e., opposite to the existing 
magnetic field. 
</p>
<p>The magnetic lines of this induced field 
are represented by red-colored circles in 
the Figure 4.6(b). From the direction of 
the magnetic field thus produced, the 
direction of the induced current is found 
to be anti-clockwise by using right-hand 
thumb rule.
</p>
<p>The leftward motion of arm AB decreases 
magnetic flux. The induced current, this 
time, produces a magnetic field in the 
inward direction (red-colored crosses) i.e., 
in the direction of the existing magnetic 
field (Figure 4.6(c)). Therefore, the flux 
decrease is opposed by the flow of induced 
current. From this, it is found that induced 
current flows in clockwise direction.
</p>
<p>Illustration 2
Let us move a bar magnet towards 
</p>
<p>the solenoid, with its north pole pointing 
the solenoid (Figure 4.7(b)). This motion 
increases the magnetic flux of the coil which 
in turn, induces an electric current. Due to 
the flow of induced current, the coil becomes 
a magnetic dipole whose two magnetic poles 
are on either end of the coil. 
</p>
<p>In this case, the cause producing the 
induced current is the movement of the 
magnet. According to Lenz&rsquo;s law, the induced

<p>bar magnet and opposes the movement of 
the magnet. Once pole ends are known, the 
direction of the induced current could be 
found by using right hand thumb rule.
</p>
<p>When the bar magnet is withdrawn, 
the nearer end becomes south pole which 
attracts north pole of the bar magnet, 
opposing the receding motion of the magnet 
(Figure 4.7(c)). 
</p>
<p>Thus the direction of the induced current 
can be found from Lenz&rsquo;s law.
</p>
<p>Conservation of energy
The truth of Lenz&rsquo;s law can be established 
</p>
<p>on the basis of the law of conservation 
of energy. The explanation is as follows: 
According to Lenz&rsquo;s law, when a magnet is 
moved either towards or away from a coil, 
the induced current produced opposes its 
motion. As a result, there will always be a 
resisting force on the moving magnet. Work 
has to be done by some external agency to 
move the magnet against this resisting force. 
Here the mechanical energy of the moving 
magnet is converted into the electrical 
energy which in turn, gets converted into 
Joule heat in the coil i.e., energy is converted 
from one form to another.
</p>
<p>On the contrary to Lenz&rsquo;s law, let us 
assume that the induced current helps the 
cause responsible for its production. Now 
when we push the magnet little bit towards 
the coil, the induced current helps the 
movement of the magnet towards the coil. 
Then the magnet starts moving towards the 
coil without any expense of energy. This, 
then, becomes a perpetual motion machine. 
In practice, no such machine is possible. 
Therefore, the assumption that the induced 
current helps the cause is wrong. Thus Lenz's 
law is an excellent example of conservation 
of energy.

</p>
<p>Demonstration of Lenz&rsquo;s law
Take a narrow copper pipe and a 
</p>
<p>strongly magnetized button magnet as 
shown in figure. Keep the copper pipe 
vertical and drop the magnet into the 
pipe. Watch the motion of the magnet and 
note that magnet has become slower than 
its free fall. The reason is that an electric 
current generated by a moving magnet 
will always oppose the original motion of 
the magnet that produced the current.  
</p>
<p>Activity
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>Solution
From right hand rule, the magnetic field by 
the straight wire is directed into the plane 
of the square loop perpendicularly and its 
magnetic flux is decreasing. The decrease 
in flux is opposed by the current induced 
in the loop by producing a magnetic field 
in the same direction as the magnetic field 
of the wire. Again from right hand rule, for 
this inward magnetic field, the direction of 
the induced current in the loop is clockwise.
</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 4.7
</p>
<p>The magnetic flux passes perpendicular 
to the plane of the circuit and is directed 
into the paper. If the magnetic flux varies 
with respect to time as per the following 
relation: ΦB t t t= + + +( )2 3 8 53 2 mWb , what 
is the magnitude of the induced emf in the 
loop when t = 3 s? Find out the direction of 
current through the circuit.

<p>(ii)  As time passes, the magnetic flux linked 
with the loop increases. According 
to Lenz&rsquo;s law, the direction of the 
induced current should be in a way so 
as to oppose the flux increase. So, the 
induced current flows in such a way to 
produce a magnetic field opposite to 
the given field. This magnetic field is 
perpendicularly outwards. Therefore, 
the induced current flows in anti-
clockwise direction.

<p>The action of this Lorentz force is to

<p>EDDY CURRENTS
</p>
<p>According to Faraday&rsquo;s law of 
electromagnetic induction, an emf is 
induced in a conductor when the magnetic 
flux passing through it changes. However, 
the conductor need not be in the form of a 
wire or coil. 
</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 4.8
</p>
<p>A conducting rod of length 0.5 m falls 
freely from the top of a building of height 
7.2 m at a place in Chennai where the 
horizontal component of Earth&rsquo;s magnetic 
field is 4.04 &times; 10&ndash;5 T. If the length of the 
rod is perpendicular to Earth&rsquo;s horizontal 
magnetic field, find the emf induced across 
the conductor when the rod is about to 
touch the ground. (Assume that the rod falls 
down with constant acceleration of 10 m s&ndash;2)
Solution
l = 0.5 m; h = 7.2 m; u = 0 m s&ndash;1;

<p>oppose the oscillation. A heavy damping force 
of eddy currents will bring the pendulum to 
rest within a few oscillations (Figure 4.11(b)). 
</p>
<p>However if some slots are cut in the 
disc (Figure 4.11(c)), the eddy currents 
are reduced. The pendulum now will 
execute several oscillations before coming 
to rest. This clearly demonstrates the 
production of eddy current in the disc of 
the pendulum.
</p>
<p>Drawbacks of Eddy currents
When eddy currents flow in the 
</p>
<p>conductor, a large amount of energy is 
dissipated in the form of heat. The energy 
loss due to the flow of eddy current is 
inevitable but it can be reduced to a greater 
extent with suitable measures.
</p>
<p>The design of transformer core and 
electric motor armature is crucial in order 
to minimise the eddy current loss. To reduce 
these losses, the core of the transformer is 
made up of thin laminas insulated from one 
another (Figure 4.12 (a)) while for electric 
motor the winding is made up of a group 
</p>
<p>Even for a conductor in the form of 
a sheet or plate, an emf is induced when 
magnetic flux linked with it changes. But 
the difference is that there is no definite 
loop or path for induced current to flow 
away. As a result, the induced currents flow 
in concentric circular paths (Figure 4.10). 
As these electric currents resemble eddies 
of water, these are known as Eddy currents. 
They are also called Foucault currents. 
</p>
<p>Demonstration
Here is a simple demonstration 
</p>
<p>for the production of eddy currents. 
Consider a pendulum that can be made to 
oscillate between the poles of a powerful 
electromagnet (Figure 4.11(a)).
</p>
<p>First the electromagnet is switched off, the 
pendulum is slightly displaced and released. 
It begins to oscillate and it executes a large 
number of oscillations before stopping. The 
air friction is the only damping force. 
</p>
<p>When the electromagnet is switched on and 
the disc of the pendulum is made to oscillate, 
eddy currents are produced in it which will

Though the production of eddy current 
</p>
<p>is undesirable in some cases, it is useful in 
some other cases. A few of them are
 i. Induction stove
 ii. Eddy current brake
 iii. Eddy current testing 
 iv. Electromagnetic damping
</p>
<p>i. Induction stove
Induction stove is used to cook the 
</p>
<p>food quickly and safely with less energy 
consumption. Below the cooking zone, there 
is a tightly wound coil of insulated wire. The 
cooking pan made of suitable material, is 
placed over the cooking zone. When the stove 
is switched on, an alternating current flowing 
in the coil produces high frequency alternating 
magnetic field which induces very strong eddy

<p>Example
A spherical stone and a spherical 
</p>
<p>metallic ball of same size and mass are 
dropped from the same height. Which 
one, a stone or a metal ball, will reach the 
Earth&rsquo;s surface first? Justify your answer. 
Assume that there is no air friction.
Answer
</p>
<p>The stone will reach the Earth&rsquo;s surface 
earlier than the metal ball. The reason is 
that when the metal ball falls through the 
magnetic field of Earth, the eddy currents 
are produced in it which opposes its 
motion. But in the case of stone, no eddy 
currents are produced and it falls freely.

<p>iii. Eddy current testing 
It is one of the simple non&ndash;destructive 
</p>
<p>testing methods to find defects like surface 
cracks, air bubbles present in a specimen. A 
coil of insulated wire is given an alternating 
electric current so that it produces an 
alternating magnetic field. When this coil is 
brought near the test surface, eddy current 
is induced in the test surface. The presence 
</p>
<p>currents in the cooking pan. The eddy currents 
in the pan produce so much of heat due to 
Joule heating which is used to cook the food 
(Figure 4.13).
</p>
<p>Note: The frequency of the domestic 
AC supply is increased from 50&ndash;60 Hz to 
around 20&ndash;40 KHz before giving it to the 
coil in order to produce high frequency 
alternating magnetic field.
</p>
<p>ii. Eddy current brake
This eddy current braking system is 
</p>
<p>generally used in high speed trains and 
roller coasters. Strong electromagnets are 
fixed just above the rails. To stop the train, 
electromagnets are switched on. The 
magnetic field of these magnets induces 
eddy currents in the rails which oppose or 
resist the movement of the train. This is 
Eddy current linear brake (Figure 4.14(a)).
</p>
<p>In some cases, the circular disc, connected 
to the wheel of the train through a common 
shaft, is made to rotate in between the poles 
of an electromagnet. When there is a relative 
motion between the disc and the magnet, 
eddy currents are induced in the disc which 
stop the train. This is Eddy current circular 
brake (Figure 4.14(b))

<p>SELF&ndash;INDUCTION
</p>
<p>4.3.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Inductor is a device used to store energy 
in a magnetic field when an electric current 
flows through it. The typical examples  
are coils, solenoids and toroids shown in 
Figure 4.17.
</p>
<p>Inductance is the property of inductors 
to generate emf due to the change in 
current flowing through that circuit (self-
induction) or a change in current through 
a neighbouring circuit with which it is 
magnetically linked (mutual induction). We 
will study about self-induction and mutual 
induction in the next sections.

<p>Self-induction 
An electric current flowing through a 
</p>
<p>coil will set up a magnetic field around it. 
Therefore, the magnetic flux of the magnetic 
field is linked with that coil itself. If this flux

detected by some other means.In this way, 
the defects present in the specimen are 
identified (Figure 4.15). 
iv. Electro magnetic damping
</p>
<p>The armature of the galvanometer coil 
is wound on a soft iron cylinder. Once the 
armature is deflected, the relative motion 
between the soft iron cylinder and the 
radial magnetic field induces eddy current 
in the cylinder (Figure 4.16). The damping 
force due to the flow of eddy current brings

<p>The negative sign in the above equation 
implies that the self-induced emf always 
opposes the change in current with respect 
to time. If di

</p>
<p>Inductance of a coil is also defined as the 
opposing emf induced in the coil when the 
rate of change of current through the coil 
is 1 A s&minus;1.
</p>
<p>Unit of inductance
Inductance is a scalar and its unit is 
</p>
<p>Wb A-1  or Vs A-1 . It is also measured in 
henry (H). 
</p>
<p>1 1 11 1 H  W b A  Vs A= =&minus; &minus;
</p>
<p>The dimensional formula of inductance 
is M L T A  2 2 2- - .
</p>
<p>If i = 1 A and N BΦ =1 Wb turns, then 
L =1H .
</p>
<p>Therefore, the inductance of the coil 
is said to be one henry if a current of 1 A 
produces unit flux linkage in the coil.
</p>
<p>If di
dt =
</p>
<p>&minus;1 1As and ε=&minus;1 V , then 
L =1H.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the inductance of the coil is 
one henry if a current changing at the rate of 
1 A s&minus;1 induces an opposing emf of 1 V  in it.
Physical significance of inductance
</p>
<p>We have learnt about inertia in XI 
standard. In translational motion, mass is a 
measure of linear inertia; in the same way, 
for rotational motion, moment of inertia 
is a measure of rotational inertia (Refer 
sections 3.2.1 and 5.4 of XI physics text 
book). Generally, inertia means opposition 
to change its state.
</p>
<p>is changed by changing the current, an emf is 
induced in that same coil (Figure 4.18). This 
phenomenon is known as self-induction. 
The emf induced is called self-induced emf.

<p>Let ΦB  be the magnetic flux linked with

or simply inductance of a coil is defined 
as the flux linkage with the coil when 1A 
current flows through it.

</p>
<p>The inductance plays the same role in a 
circuit as mass and moment of inertia play 
in mechanical motion. When a circuit is 
switched on, the increasing current induces 
an emf which opposes the growth of current 
in a circuit (Figure 4.19(a)). Likewise, when 
circuit is broken, the decreasing current 
induces an emf in the reverse direction. 
This emf now opposes the decay of current 
(Figure 4.19(b)).
</p>
<p>Thus, inductance of the coil opposes any 
change in current and tries to maintain the 
original state.

of the current. In order to establish a current 
in the circuit, work is done against this 
opposition by some external agency. This 
work done is stored as magnetic potential 
energy.

<p>4.3.3 Mutual induction
</p>
<p>When an electric current passing 
through a coil changes with time, an 
emf is induced in the neighbouring coil. 
This phenomenon is known as mutual 
induction and the emf induced is called 
mutually induced emf.
</p>
<p>Consider two coils which are placed close 
to each other. If an electric current i1 is sent 
through coil 1, the magnetic field produced 
by it is also linked with coil 2 as shown in 
Figure 4.21(a). 
</p>
<p>If Φ21  is the magnetic flux linked with 
each turn of the coil 2 of N2  turns due to the 
current in coil 1, then the total flux linked 
with coil 2 ( )N2 21Φ is proportional to the 
current i1 in the coil 1.

</p>
<p>Consider two long co-axial solenoids of 
same length l. The length of these solenoids 
is large when compared to their radii so 
that the magnetic field produced inside the 
solenoids is uniform and the fringing effect 
at the ends may be ignored. Let A1 and A2 be 
the area of cross section of the solenoids with 
A1 being greater than A2 as shown in Figure

n1 and n2  respectively.

</p>
<p>1 11= &minus;A s , then M21 2=&minus;ε .  
Mutual inductance M21 is also defined as 
the opposing emf induced in the coil 2 
when the rate of change of current through 
the coil 1 is 1As&ndash;1.
</p>
<p>Similarly, if an electric current i2  through 
coil 2 changes with time, then emf ε1  is

<p>where M12  is the mutual inductance of the 
coil 1 with respect to coil 2. It can be shown 
that for a given pair of coils, the mutual 
inductance is same. i.e.,
</p>
<p>M M M21 12= =
</p>
<p>In general, the mutual induction between 
two coils depends on size, shape, the number 
of turns of the coils, their relative orientation 
and permeability of the medium.
</p>
<p>Unit of mutual-inductance
The unit of mutual inductance is also 
</p>
<p>henry (H). 
</p>
<p>If i1 1= A  and N2 21 1Φ =  Wb turns,  
then M =1H .
</p>
<p>Therefore, the mutual inductance 
between two neighbouring coils is said to 
be one henry if a current of 1A in one coil 
produces unit flux linkage in neighbouring 
coil.

METHODS OF PRODUCING 
INDUCED EMF
</p>
<p>4.4.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Electromotive force is the characteristic 
of any energy source capable of driving 
electric charge around a circuit. We have 
already learnt that it is not actually a force. 
It is the work done in moving unit electric 
charge around the circuit. It is measured in 
J C&ndash;1 or volt.
</p>
<p>Some examples of energy source which 
provide emf are electrochemical cells, 
thermoelectric devices, solar cells and 
electrical generators. Of these, electrical

<p>Consider two coplanar, co-axial circular 
coils A and B as shown in figure. The radius 
of coil A is 20 cm while that of coil B is 2 
cm. The number of turns in coils A and B 
are 200 and 1000 respectively. Calculate the 
mutual inductance between the coils. If the 
current in coil A changes from 2 A to 6 A 
in 0.04 s, determine the induced emf in coil 
B and the rate of change of flux through the 
coil B at that instant.

<p>This emf is known as motional emf

</p>
<p>According to Faraday&rsquo;s law of

induced emf. The magnitude of the induced

</p>
<p>From the above equation, it is clear that 
induced emf can be produced by changing 
magnetic flux in any of the following ways.
(i)  By changing the magnetic field B
(ii)  By changing the area A of the coil 
</p>
<p>and
(iii)  By changing the relative orientation

</p>
<p>4.4.2 Production of induced emf 
by changing the magnetic field
</p>
<p>From Faraday&rsquo;s experiments on 
electromagnetic induction, it was discovered 
that an emf is induced in a circuit by changing 
the magnetic flux of the field through it. The 
change in flux is brought about by (i) relative 
motion between the circuit and the magnet 
(First experiment) (ii) variation in current 
flowing through the nearby coil (Second 
experiment).

<p>energy needed to move the rod is converted 
into electrical energy which then appears 
as thermal energy in the loop. This energy 
conversion is consistent with the law of 
conservation of energy.
</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 4.14
</p>
<p>A circular metal of area 0.03 m2 rotates 
in a uniform magnetic field of 0.4 T. The 
axis of rotation passes through the centre 
and perpendicular to its plane and is also 
parallel to the field. If the disc completes 
20 revolutions in one second and the 
resistance of the disc is 4 Ω, calculate the 
induced emf between the axis and the rim 
and induced current flowing in the disc.

<p>A rectangular coil of area 70 cm2

<p>In a time t seconds, the coil is rotated through 
an angle θ (= ωt) in anti&ndash;clockwise direction. 
In this position, the flux linked NBAcosωt is 
due to the component of 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>B normal to the plane 
of the coil. The component (B  sinωt) parallel 
to the plane has no role in electromagnetic 
induction.  Therefore, the flux linkage with the 
coil at this deflected position is

<p>When the coil is rotated through 90o

maximum value of induced emf is

<p>Therefore, the value of induced emf at 
any instant is then given by
</p>
<p>ε ε ω= m tsin  (4.22)
</p>
<p>It is seen that the induced emf varies 
as sine function of the time angle ωt. The 
graph between induced emf and time angle 
for one rotation of the coil will be a sine 
curve (Figure 4.25) and the emf varying 
in this manner is called sinusoidal emf or 
alternating emf.
</p>
<p>If this alternating voltage is given to a 
closed circuit, a sinusoidally varying current 
flows in it. This current is called alternating 
current and is given by
</p>
<p>i I tm= sinω  (4.23)
</p>
<p>where Im is the maximum value of 
induced current.

<p>the conductor which in turn, induces an 
emf. The magnitude of the induced emf is 
given by Faraday&rsquo;s law of electromagnetic 
induction and its direction by Fleming&rsquo;s 
right hand rule.
</p>
<p>Alternating emf is generated 
by rotating a coil in a 
magnetic field or by rotating 
</p>
<p>a magnetic field within a stationary coil.
The first method is used for small AC 
generators while the second method is 
employed for large AC generators. The 
rotating-field method is the one which 
is mostly used in power stations.
</p>
<p>Note
</p>
<p>4.5.3 Construction
</p>
<p>Alternator consists of two major parts, 
namely stator and rotor. As their names 
suggest, stator is stationary while rotor 
rotates inside the stator. In any standard 
construction of commercial alternators, the 
armature winding is mounted on stator and 
the field magnet on rotor. 
i) Stator 
</p>
<p>The stationary part which has armature 
windings mounted in it is called stator. It 
has two components, namely stator core 
and armature winding.
</p>
<p>Stator core or armature core is made up 
of iron or steel alloy. It is a hollow cylinder 
and is laminated to minimize eddy current 
loss. The slots are cut on inner surface of the 
core to accommodate armature windings.
</p>
<p>Armature winding is 
the coil, wound on slots 
provided in the armature 
core (Figure 4.27).
</p>
<p>ii) Rotor 
</p>
<p>Rotor contains magnetic field windings. 
The magnetic poles are magnetized by

<p>AC GENERATOR
</p>
<p>4.5.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>AC generator or alternator is an energy 
conversion device. It converts mechanical 
energy used to rotate the coil or field magnet 
into electrical energy. Alternator produces 
a large scale electrical power for use in 
homes and industries. AC generator and its 
components are shown in Figure 4.26.

<p>Alternators work on the principle of 
electromagnetic induction. The relative 
motion between a conductor and a magnetic 
field changes the magnetic flux linked with

</p>
<p>2)  The insulation of stationary armature 
winding is easier. 
</p>
<p>3)  The number of sliding contacts (slip rings) 
is reduced. Moreover, the sliding contacts 
are used for low-voltage DC Source.
</p>
<p>4)  Armature windings can be constructed 
more rigidly to prevent deformation due 
to any mechanical stress.
</p>
<p>4.5.5 Single phase AC generator
</p>
<p>In a single phase AC generator, the 
armature conductors are connected in series 
so as to form a single circuit which generates 
a single-phase alternating emf and hence it 
is called single-phase alternator. 
</p>
<p>In the simplified version of AC generator, 
a single-turn rectangular loop PQRS is 
mounted on the stator. The field winding is 
fixed inside the stator and it can be rotated 
about an axis, perpendicular to the plane of 
the paper. 
</p>
<p>The loop PQRS is stationary and is also 
perpendicular to the plane of the paper. 
When field windings are excited, magnetic 
field is produced around it. Let the field 
magnet be rotated in clockwise direction by 
some external means (Figure 4.28).

<p>DC source. The ends of field windings are 
connected to a pair of slip rings, attached 
to a common shaft about which rotor 
rotates. Slip rings rotate along with rotor. 
To maintain connection between the DC 
source and field windings, two brushes  
are used which continuously slide over the 
slip rings. The 2-pole rotor is shown in 
Figure 4.27.
</p>
<p>We will discuss the construction and 
working of two examples, namely single 
phase and three phase AC generators in 
the following sections.

<p>4.5.4 Advantages of 
stationary armature-rotating 
field alternator
</p>
<p>Alternators are generally high current 
and high voltage machines. The stationary 
armature-rotating field construction has 
many advantages. A few of them include:
1)  The current is drawn directly from fixed 
</p>
<p>terminals on the stator without the use 
of brush contacts.

</p>
<p>of the induced emf is at right angles to the 
plane of the paper. For PQ, it is inwards and 
for RS it is outwards. Therefore, the current 
flows along PQRS. The point A in the graph 
represents this maximum emf. 
</p>
<p>For the rotation of 180&deg; from the initial 
position, the field is again perpendicular to 
PQRS and the induced emf becomes zero. 
This is represented by point B. 
</p>
<p>The field magnet becomes again parallel 
to PQRS for 270&deg; rotation of field magnet. 
The induced emf is maximum but the 
direction is reversed. Thus the current flows 
along SRQP. This is represented by point C. 
</p>
<p>On completion of 360&deg;, the induced 
emf becomes zero and is represented by the 
point D. From the graph, it is clear that emf 
induced in PQRS is alternating in nature. 
Therefore, when field magnet completes 
one rotation, induced emf in PQRS finishes 
one cycle.
</p>
<p>Assume that initial position of the field 
magnet is horizontal. At that instant, the 
direction of magnetic field is perpendicular 
to the plane of the loop PQRS. The induced 
emf is zero (Refer case (iii) of section 4.4). 
This is represented by origin O in the graph 
drawn between induced emf and time angle 
(Figure 4.29). 
</p>
<p>When field magnet rotates through 
90&deg;, magnetic field becomes parallel to 
PQRS. The induced emfs across PQ and RS 
would become maximum. Since they are 
connected in series, emfs are added up and 
the direction of total induced emf is given 
by Fleming&rsquo;s right hand rule. 
</p>
<p>Care has to be taken while applying this 
rule; the thumb indicates the direction of the 
motion of the conductor with respect to field. 
For clockwise rotating poles, the conductor 
appears to be rotating anticlockwise. Hence, 
thumb should point to the left. The direction

<p>The initial position of the field 
magnet is horizontal and field direction is 
perpendicular to the plane of the coil 1. As 
it is seen in single phase AC generator, when 
field magnet is rotated from that position in 
clockwise direction, alternating emf ε1  in 
coil 1 begins a cycle from origin O. This is 
shown in Figure 4.31.
</p>
<p>The corresponding cycle for alternating 
emf ε2  in coil 2 starts at point A after field 
magnet has rotated through 120&deg;. Therefore, 
the phase difference between ε1  and ε2  is 
120&deg;. Similarly, emf ε3  in coil 3 would begin 
its cycle at point B after 240&deg; rotation of field 
magnet from initial position. Thus these emfs 
produced in the three phase AC generator have 
120&deg; phase difference between one another.

<p>4.5.8 Advantages of three-
phase alternator
</p>
<p>Three-phase system has many advantages 
over single-phase system. Let us see a few of 
them.
</p>
<p>4.5.6 Poly-phase AC 
generator
</p>
<p>Some AC generators may have more 
than one coil in the armature core and each 
coil produces an alternating emf. In these 
generators, more than one emf is produced. 
Thus they are called poly-phase generators. 
</p>
<p>If there are two alternating emfs 
produced in a generator, it is called two-
phase generator. In some AC generators, 
there are three separate coils, which would 
give three separate emfs. Hence they are 
called three-phase AC generators.
</p>
<p>4.5.7 Three-phase AC 
generator
</p>
<p>In the simplified construction of three-
phase AC generator, the armature core has 
6 slots, cut on its inner rim. Each slot is 
60&deg; away from one another. Six armature 
conductors are mounted in these slots. The 
conductors 1 and 4 are joined in series to 
form coil 1. The conductors 3 and 6 form 
coil 2 while the conductors 5 and 2 form 
coil 3. So, these coils are retangular in 
shape and are 120&deg; apart from one another 
(Figure 4.30).

<p>laminated and is made up of a good 
magnetic material like silicon steel. Coils 
are electrically insulated but magnetically 
linked via transformer core (Figure 4.32).
</p>
<p>The coil across which alternating voltage 
is applied is called primary coil P and the 
coil from which output power is drawn out 
is called secondary coil S. The assembled 
core and coils are kept in a container which 
is filled with suitable medium for better 
insulation and cooling purpose.
</p>
<p>Working 
If the primary coil is connected to a 
</p>
<p>source of alternating voltage, an alternating 
magnetic flux is set up in the laminated 
core. If there is no magnetic flux leakage, 
then whole of magnetic flux linked with 
primary coil is also linked with secondary 
</p>
<p>1)  For a given dimension of the generator, 
three-phase machine produces higher 
power output than a single-phase machine.
</p>
<p>2)  For the same capacity, three-phase 
alternator is smaller in size when 
compared to single-phase alternator.
</p>
<p>3)  Three-phase transmission system is 
cheaper. A relatively thinner wire is 
sufficient for transmission of three-
phase power.
</p>
<p>4.6
</p>
<p>TRANSFORMER
</p>
<p>Transformer is a stationary device used to 
transform electrical power from one circuit 
to another without changing its frequency. 
The applied alternating voltage is either 
increased or decreased with corresponding 
decrease or increase of current in the circuit. 
</p>
<p>If the transformer converts an alternating 
current with low voltage into an alternating 
current with high voltage, it is called step-up 
transformer. On the contrary, if the transformer 
converts alternating current with high voltage 
into an alternating current with low voltage, 
then it is called step-down transformer. 
</p>
<p>4.6.1 Construction and 
working of transformer
</p>
<p>Principle 
The principle of transformer is the 
</p>
<p>mutual induction between two coils. That 
is, when an electric current passing through 
a coil changes with time, an emf is induced 
in the neighbouring coil.
Construction 
</p>
<p>In the simple construction of 
transformers, there are two coils of high 
mutual inductance wound over the same 
transformer core. The core is generally

power to the input power. Thus

</p>
<p>100%  (4.28)
</p>
<p>Transformers are highly efficient devices 
having their efficiency in the range of 96 &ndash; 
99%. Various energy losses in transformers 
will not allow them to be 100% efficient.
</p>
<p>4.6.2 Energy losses in a 
transformer
</p>
<p>Transformers do not have any moving 
parts so that its efficiency is much higher 
than that of rotating machines like generators 
and motors. But there are many factors 
which lead to energy loss in a transformer. 
i) Core loss or Iron loss
</p>
<p>This loss takes place in transformer core. 
Hysteresis loss (Refer section 3.6) and 
eddy current loss are known as core loss 
or Iron loss. When transformer core is 
magnetized and demagnetized repeatedly 
by the alternating voltage applied across 
primary coil, hysteresis takes place due to 
</p>
<p>coil. This means that rate at which magnetic 
flux changes through each turn is same for 
both primary and secondary coils. 
</p>
<p>As a result of flux change, emf is induced 
in both primary and secondary coils. The 
emf induced in the primary coil or back emf 
εp is given by
</p>

primary is equal to the back emf. Then

<p>B=&minus;
Φ  (4.24)
</p>
<p>The frequency of alternating magnetic 
flux in the core is same as the frequency of 
the applied voltage. Therefore, induced emf 
in secondary will also have same frequency 
as that of applied voltage. The emf induced 
in the secondary coil εs is given by
</p>
<p>εs s

</p>
<p>dt

</p>
<p>Φ  
</p>
<p>where Np  and Ns are the number of turns in 
the primary and secondary coil respectively.

where vs is the voltage across secondary coil.

<p>power is lost due to Joule heating (i R2 ) in 
the transmission lines which are hundreds 
of kilometer long. This power loss can be 
tackled either by reducing current I or by 
reducing resistance R  of the transmission 
lines. The resistance R can be reduced 
with thick wires of copper or aluminium. 
But this increases the cost of production 
of transmission lines and other related 
expenses. So this way of reducing power loss 
is not economically viable.

<p>Since power produced is alternating 
in nature, there is a way out. The most 
important property of alternating voltage 
that it can be stepped up and stepped down 
by using transformers could be exploited 
in reducing current and thereby reducing 
power losses to a greater extent. 
</p>
<p>At the transmitting point, the voltage is 
increased and the corresponding current 
is decreased by using step-up transformer 
(Figure 4.33). Then it is transmitted 
through transmission lines. This reduced 
current at high voltage reaches the 
destination without any appreciable loss. At 
the receiving point, the voltage is decreased 
and the current is increased to appropriate 
values by using step-down transformer 
and then it is given to consumers. Thus 
power transmission is done efficiently and 
economically. 
</p>
<p>which some energy is lost in the form of 
heat. Hysteresis loss is minimized by using 
steel of high silicon content in making 
transformer core.
Alternating magnetic flux in the core 
induces eddy currents in it. Therefore 
there is energy loss due to the flow of 
eddy current, called eddy current loss 
which is minimized by using very thin 
laminations of transformer core.
</p>
<p>ii) Copper loss
Transformer windings have electrical 
resistance. When an electric current 
flows through them, some amount of 
energy is dissipated due to Joule heating. 
This energy loss is called copper loss 
which is minimized by using wires of 
larger diameter. 
</p>
<p>iii) Flux leakage
Flux leakage happens when the magnetic 
lines of primary coil are not completely 
linked with secondary coil. Energy loss 
due to this flux leakage is minimized by 
winding coils one over the other.

<p>4.6.3 Advantages of AC 
in long distance power 
transmission
</p>
<p>Electric power is produced in a large 
scale at electric power stations with the help 
of AC generators. These power stations are 
classified based on the type of fuel used as 
thermal, hydro electric and nuclear power 
stations. Most of these stations are located 
at remote places. Hence the electric power 
generated is transmitted over long distances 
through transmission lines to reach towns 
or cities where it is actually consumed. This 
process is called power transmission. 
</p>
<p>But there is a difficulty during power 
transmission. A sizable fraction of electric

<p>Power system at a glance (Not for Examination)
</p>
<p>The generating stations present in a region are interconnected to form a common electrical 
network and are operated in parallel. This is to ensure uninterrupted power supply to a large 
number of consumers in the case of failure of any power station or a sudden increase of load 
beyond the capacity of the generating station. 
</p>
<p>The various elements such as generating stations, transmission lines, the substations and 
distributors etc are all tied together for continuous generation and consumption of electric 
energy.This is called power system. A part of power system consisting of the sub-stations and 
transmission lines is known as a grid. 
</p>
<p>In a power system, the transfer of electric power produced to the consumer is carried out 
in two stages which are further sub-divided into two as given below.
</p>
<p>1) Transmission stage
 a) Primary transmission stage
 b)  Secondary transmission stage
2) Distribution stage
 a) Primary distribution stage
 b)  Secondary transmission stage
</p>
<p>and then it is supplied to individual 
consumers. These two stages of power 
transmission is presented in a single-
line diagram shown in figure. The 
central system usually generates power 
at 11 kV which is stepped up to 132 kV 
and is transmitted through transmission 
lines. This is known as primary or high-
voltage transmission. 
</p>
<p>This high-voltage power reaches 
receiving station at the outskirts of the 
city where it is stepped down to 33 kV 
and is transmitted as secondary or low-
voltage transmission to sub-stations 
situated within the city limits. 
</p>
<p>In the primary distribution system, 
the voltage is reduced from 33 kV to 
3.3kV at sub-stations and is given to 
distribution sub-stations. The voltage is 
finally brought down to 440V or 230V at 
distribution sub-station from where secondary distribution is done to factories (440V) and 
homes (230V) via distribution networks.

<p>ALTERNATING CURRENT
</p>
<p>4.7.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>In section 4.5, we have seen that when 
the orientation of the coil with the magnetic 
field is changed, an alternating emf is 
induced and hence an alternating current 
flows in the closed circuit. An alternating 
voltage is the voltage which changes 
polarity at regular intervals of time and 
the direction of the resulting alternating 
current also changes accordingly.
</p>
<p>In the Figure 4.34(a), an alternating 
voltage source is connected to a resistor R 
in which the upper terminal of the source 
</p>
<p>is positive and lower terminal negative at 
an instant. Therefore, the current flows 
in clockwise direction. After a short time, 
the polarities of the source are reversed so 
that current now flows in anti-clockwise 
direction (Figure 4.34(b)). This current 
which flows in alternate directions in the 
circuit is called alternating current.
</p>
<p>Sinusoidal alternating voltage
If the waveform of alternating voltage is 
</p>
<p>a sine wave, then it is known as sinusoidal 
alternating voltage which is given by the 
relation.
</p>
<p>v =V tm sinω  (4.29)
</p>
<p>where υ is the instantaneous value of 
alternating voltage; Vm is the maximum value 
(amplitude) and ω is the angular frequency 
of the alternating voltage. When sinusoidal 
alternating voltage is applied to a closed 
circuit, the resulting alternating current is 
also sinusoidal in nature and its relation is
</p>
<p>i I tm= sinω  (4.30)
</p>
<p>where Im is the maximum value (amplitude) 
of the alternating current. The direction 
of sinusoidal voltage or current is reversed 
after every half-cycle and its magnitude 
is also changing continuously as shown in 
Figure 4.35.

<p>The instantaneous value of sinusoidal 
alternating current is given by the equation 
i I i Im m= =sin t or sinω θ  (where θ = ωt) 
whose graphical representation is given in 
Figure 4.36.

<p>The sum of all currents over a half-cycle 
is given by area of positive half-cycle (or 
negative half-cycle). Therefore,

associated with sine waves. Thus sine

<p>Note
</p>
<p>4.7.2 Mean or Average  
value of AC
</p>
<p>The current and voltage in a DC system 
remain constant over a period of time 
so that there is no problem in specifying 
their magnitudes. However, an alternating 
current or voltage varies from time to time. 
Then a question arises how to express the 
magnitude of an alternating current or 
voltage. Though there are many ways of 
expressing it, we limit our discussion with 
two ways, namely mean value and RMS 
(Root Mean Square) value of AC.
</p>
<p>Mean or Average value of AC
We have learnt that the magnitude of 
</p>
<p>an alternating current in a circuit changes 
from one instant to other instant and its 
direction also reverses for every half cycle. 
During positive half cycle, current is taken 
as positive and during negative cycle it is 
negative. Therefore mean or average value 
of symmetrical alternating current over one 
complete cycle is zero. 
</p>
<p>Therefore the average or mean value is 
measured over one half of a cycle. These 
electrical terms, average current and average 
voltage, can be used in both AC and DC 
circuit analysis and calculations.
</p>
<p>The average value of alternating 
current is defined as the average of all 
values of current over a positive half-cycle 
or a negative half-cycle.

<p>The base length of one cycle is 2π . Substi-

</p>
<p>Hence the average value of AC is 
0.637 times the maximum value Im of the 
alternating current. For negative half-cycle, 
I Iav m= &minus;0 637. .

<p>4.7.3 RMS value of AC
</p>
<p>The term RMS refers to time-varying 
sinusoidal currents and voltages which is 
not used in DC systems. 
</p>
<p>The root mean square value of an 
alternating current is defined as the 
square root of the mean of the squares of 
all currents over one cycle. It is denoted by 
IRMS . For alternating voltages, the RMS value 
is given by VRMS .
</p>
<p>The alternating current i I i Im m= =sin t or sinω θ 
or i I i Im m= =sin t or sinω θ, is represented graphically 
in Figure 4.37. The corresponding squared 
current wave is also shown by the dotted 
lines. 
</p>
<p>The sum of the squares of all currents 
over one cycle is given by the area of one 
cycle of squared wave. Therefore,

</p>
<p>For common household 
appliances, the voltage 
rating and current rating 
</p>
<p>are generally specified in terms of 
their RMS value. The domestic AC 
supply is 230V, 50 Hz. It is the RMS or 
effective value. Its peak value will be 
V Vm rms= = &times; =2 2 230 325 V.
</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 4.18
</p>
<p>Write down the equation for a sinusoidal 
voltage of 50 Hz and its peak value is 20 V.  
Draw the corresponding voltage versus 
time graph.

<p>Thus we find that for a symmetrical 
sinusoidal current rms value of current is 
70.7 % of its peak value.
</p>
<p>Similarly for alternating voltage, it can be 
shown that 
</p>
<p>V VRMS m= 0 707.  (4.36)
</p>
<p>RMS value of alternating 
current is also called 
effective value and is 
</p>
<p>represented as Ieff. It is used to compare 
RMS current of AC to an equivalent 
steady current. 
RMS value is also defined as that value 
of the steady current which when 
flowing through a given circuit for a 
given time produces the same amount 
of heat as produced by the alternating 
current when flowing through the 
same circuit for the same time. The 
effective value of an alternating voltage 
is represented by Veff.

<p>The diagram which shows various

Phasor
</p>
<p>A sinusoidal alternating voltage (or 
current) can be represented by a vector which 
rotates about the origin in anti-clockwise  
direction at a constant angular velocity ω. 
Such a rotating vector is called a phasor. A 
phasor is drawn in such a way that
</p>
<p>&middot;&emsp; &emsp;the length of the line segment equals the 
peak value Vm (or Im) of the alternating 
voltage (or current)
</p>
<p>&middot;&emsp; &emsp;its angular velocity ω is equal to the 
angular frequency of the alternating 
voltage (or current)
</p>
<p>&middot;&emsp; &emsp;the projection of phasor on any vertical 
axis gives the instantaneous value of the 
alternating voltage (or current)

reactance (XL). It is measured in ohm.
</p>
<p>X LL =ω
</p>
<p>An inductor blocks AC but it allows 
DC. Why? and How?
</p>
<p>An inductor L is a closely wound 
helical coil. The steady DC current flowing 
through L produces uniform magnetic 
field around it and the magnetic flux 
linked remains constant. Therefore there 
is no self-induction and self-induced emf 
(back emf). Since inductor behaves like a 
resistor, DC flows through an inductor. 
</p>
<p>The AC flowing through L produces 
time-varying magnetic field which in 
turn induces self-induced emf (back 
emf). This back emf, according to Lenz&rsquo;s 
law, opposes any change in the current. 
Since AC varies both in magnitude and 
direction, its flow is opposed in L. For an 
ideal inductor of zero ohmic resistance, 
the back emf is equal and opposite to the 
applied emf. Therefore L blocks AC.

<p>Unit 4  ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION AND ALTERNATING CURRENT 243
</p>
<p>A capacitor blocks DC but it allows AC. Why? and How? (Not for examination)
Capacitors have two parallel metallic plates placed close to each other and there is a gap between plates. 
</p>
<p>Whenever a source of voltage (either DC voltage or AC voltage) is connected across a capacitor C, the electrons 
from the source will reach the plate and stop. They cannot jump across the gap between plates to continue 
its flow in the circuit. Therefore the electrons flowing in one direction (i.e. DC) cannot pass through the 
capacitor. But the electrons from AC source seem to flow through C. Let us see what really happens!
</p>
<p>DC cannot flow through a capacitor: 
Consider a parallel plate capacitor whose plates are uncharged (same amount of positive and negative 
</p>
<p>charges). A DC source (battery) is connected across C as shown in Figure (a).
</p>
<p>As soon as battery 
is connected, electrons 
start to flow from the 
negative terminal and 
are accumulated at the 
right plate, making it 
negative. Due to this 
negative potential, the 
electrons present in the nearby left plate are repelled and are moved towards positive terminal of the battery. 
When electrons leave the left plate, it becomes positively charged. This process is known as charging. The 
direction of flow of electrons is shown by arrows. 
</p>
<p>The charging of the plates continues till the level of the battery. Once C is fully charged and current will stop. 
At this time, we say that capacitor is blocking DC Figure (c).
</p>
<p>AC flows (?!) through a capacitor: 
Now an AC source is connected across C. At an instant, the right side of the source is at negative potential, 
</p>
<p>then the electrons flow from negative terminal to the right plate and from left plate to the positive terminal as 
shown in Figure (d) but no electron crosses the gap between the plates. These electron-flows are represented 
by arrows. Thus, the charging of the plates takes place and the plates become fully charged (Figure (e)).
</p>
<p>After a short time, the polarities of AC source are reversed and the right side of the source is now positive. 
The electrons which were accumulated in the right plate start to flow to the positive terminal and the electrons 
from negative terminal flow to the left plate to neutralize the positive charges stored in it. As a result, the 
net charges present in the plates begin to decrease and this is called discharging. These electron-flows are 
represented by arrows as shown in Figure (f). Once the charges are exhausted, C will be charged again but 
with reversed polarities as shown in Figure (g).
</p>
<p>Thus the electrons flow in one direction while charging the capacitor and its direction is reversed while 
discharging (the conventional current is also opposite in both cases). Though electrons flow in the circuit, no 
electron crosses the gap between the plates. In this way, AC flows through a capacitor.

<p>Let i be the resulting current in the 
circuit at that instant. As a result, the voltage 
is developed across R, L and C.
</p>
<p>We know that voltage across R (VR) is in 
phase with i, voltage across L (VL) leads i by 
π/2 and voltage across C (VC) lags behind i 
by π/2.

</p>

</p>
<p>The circuit is either effectively inductive

the value of VL or VC. Let us assume that  
VL&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;VC. Therefore, net voltage drop across

<p>The maximum current at series 
resonance is limited by the resistance of the 
circuit. For smaller resistance, larger current 
with sharper curve is obtained and vice 
versa.
</p>
<p>Applications of series RLC resonant 
circuit
</p>
<p>RLC circuits have many applications like 
filter circuits, oscillators, voltage multipliers 
etc. An important use of series RLC resonant 
circuits is in the tuning circuits of radio 
and TV systems. The signals from many 
broadcasting stations at different frequencies 
are available in the air. To receive the signal 
of a particular station, tuning is done. 
</p>
<p>The tuning is commonly achieved by 
varying capacitance of a parallel plate 
variable capacitor, thereby changing the 
resonant frequency of the circuit. When 
resonant frequency is nearly equal to the 
frequency of the signal of the particular 
station, the amplitude of the current in the 
circuit is maximum. Thus the signal of that 
station alone is received.
</p>
<p>The phenomenon of electrical 
resonance is possible when 
the circuit contains both L 
</p>
<p>and C. Only then the voltage across L 
and C cancel one another when VL and 
VC are 180&deg; out of phase and the circuit 
becomes purely resistive. This implies 
that resonance will not occur in RL and 
RC circuits.

<p>This is the condition for resonance in

</p>
<p>Since XL and XC are frequency dependent, 
the resonance condition X XL C=( ) can be 
achieved by varying the frequency of the 
applied voltage.
</p>
<p>Effects of series resonance
When series resonance occurs, the 
</p>
<p>impedance of the circuit is minimum and 
is equal to the resistance of the circuit. As 
a result of this, the current in the circuit 
becomes maximum.  This is shown in the 
resonance curve drawn between current 
and frequency (Figure 4.49).

<p>POWER IN AC CIRCUITS
</p>
<p>4.8.1 Introduction of power 
in AC circuits
</p>
<p>Power of a circuit is defined as the rate 
of consumption of electric energy in that 
circuit.  It is given by the product of the voltage 
and current. In an AC circuit, the voltage and 
current vary continuously with time. Let us 
first calculate the power at an instant and then 
it is averaged over a complete cycle. 
</p>
<p>The alternating voltage and alternating 
current in the series inductive RLC circuit at 
an instant are given by
</p>
<p>v =V tm sinω  and i I tm= +( )sin ω φ
</p>
<p>where ϕ is the phase angle between v and i. 
The instantaneous power is then written as
</p>
<p>P = v i
    = +( )V I t tm m sin sinω ω φ
</p>
<p>    = +[ ]V I t t tm m sin sin cos cos sinω ω φ ω φ

<p>P V I t t tm m= +

</p>
<p>
cos sin sin cos sinφ ω ω ω φ2  
</p>
<p> (4.54)
</p>
<p>Here the average of sin2 ωt  over a 
cycle is 1
</p>
<p>2
 and that of sin cosω ωt t  is zero. 
</p>
<p>Substituting these values, we obtain average 
power over a cycle.

of an AC circuit is also known as the true 
power of the circuit.

</p>
<p>Advantages:
(i)  The generation of AC is cheaper than

<p>that of DC.
(ii)  When AC is supplied at higher

<p>(iii)  AC can easily be converted into DC 
with the help of rectifiers.
</p>
<p>Disadvantages:
(i)  Alternating voltages cannot be used for 
</p>
<p>certain applications such as charging 
of batteries, electroplating, electric

</p>
<p>(ii)  At high voltages, it is more dangerous 
to work with AC than DC.

<p>Unit 4  ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION AND ALTERNATING CURRENT 251
</p>
<p>Whenever energy is given to a circuit 
containing a pure inductor of inductance 
L and a capacitor of capacitance C, the 
energy oscillates back and forth between 
the magnetic field of the inductor and the 
electric field of the capacitor. Thus the 
electrical oscillations of definite frequency 
are generated. These oscillations are called 
LC oscillations.
</p>
<p>Generation of LC oscillations
Let us assume that the capacitor is fully 
</p>
<p>charged with maximum charge Qm  at the 
initial stage. So that the energy stored in 
the capacitor is maximum and is given by 
</p>
<p>U
Q
</p>
<p>CE
m=
2
</p>
<p>2 . As there is no current in the 
inductor, the energy stored in it is zero 
i.e., UB = 0. Therefore, the total energy is 
wholly electrical. This is shown in Figure 
4.52(a).
</p>
<p>The capacitor now begins to discharge 
through the inductor that establishes 
current i  in clockwise direction. This 
current produces a magnetic field around 
the inductor and the energy stored in 
</p>
<p>the inductor is given by U Li
B =
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>2 .  As 
</p>
<p>the charge in the capacitor decreases, 
the energy stored in it also decreases and 
is given by U q
</p>
<p>CE =
2
</p>
<p>2 . Thus there is a 
transfer of some part of energy from the 
capacitor to the inductor. At that instant, 
the total energy is the sum of electrical and 
magnetic energies (Figure 4.52(b)).
</p>
<p>When the charges in the capacitor are 
exhausted, its energy becomes zero i.e., 
UE = 0 . The energy is fully transferred to 
the magnetic field of the inductor and its 
energy is maximum. This maximum energy 
</p>

OSCILLATION IN LC 
CIRCUITS
</p>
<p>4.9.1 Energy conversion 
during LC oscillations
</p>
<p>We have learnt that energy can be stored 
in both inductors and capacitors (Refer 
sections 1.8.2 and 4.3.2). In inductors, the 
energy is stored in the form of magnetic 
field while in capacitors, it is stored as the 
electric field. 
</p>

<p>Unit 4  ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION AND ALTERNATING CURRENT252
</p>
<p>The state of the circuit is similar to the 
initial state but the difference is that the 
capacitor is charged in opposite direction. 
The capacitor then starts to discharge 
through the inductor with anti-clockwise 
current. The total energy is the sum of the 
electrical and magnetic energies (Figure 
4.52(f)).
</p>
<p>As already explained, the processes 
are repeated in opposite direction (Figure 
4.52(g) and (h)). Finally, the circuit returns 
to the initial state (Figure 4.52(a)). Thus, 
when the circuit goes through these stages, 
an alternating current flows in the circuit. 
As this process is repeated again and 
again, the electrical oscillations of definite 
frequency are generated. These are known 
as LC oscillations. 
</p>
<p>In the ideal LC circuit, there is no loss 
of energy. Therefore, the oscillations will 
continue indefinitely. Such oscillations are 
called undamped oscillations. 
</p>
<p>maximum current flowing in the circuit. 
The total energy is wholly magnetic (Figure 
4.52(c)).
</p>
<p>Even though the charge in the capacitor is 
zero, the current will continue to flow in the 
same direction because the inductor will not 
allow it to stop immediately. The current is 
made to flow with decreasing magnitude by 
the collapsing magnetic field of the inductor. 
As a result of this, the capacitor begins to 
charge in the opposite direction. A part of 
the energy is transferred from the inductor 
back to the capacitor. The total energy is the 
sum of the electrical and magnetic energies 
(Figure 4.52(d)).
</p>
<p>When the current in the circuit reduces 
to zero, the capacitor becomes fully charged 
in the opposite direction. The energy stored 
in the capacitor becomes maximum. Since 
the current is zero, the energy stored in the 
inductor is zero. The total energy is wholly 
electrical (Figure 4.52(e)).

<p>4.9.3 Analogies between 
LC oscillations and simple 
harmonic oscillations
</p>
<p>Qualitative treatment
The electromagnetic oscillations of LC 
</p>
<p>system can be compared with the mechanical 
oscillations of a spring-mass system.
</p>
<p>There are two forms of energy involved 
in LC oscillations. One is electrical energy 
of the charged capacitor; the other magnetic 
energy of the inductor carrying current.
</p>
<p>But in practice, the Joule 
heating and radiation of 
electromagnetic waves from 
</p>
<p>the circuit decrease the energy of the 
system.  Therefore, the oscillations 
become damped oscillations.
</p>
<p>Note
</p>
<p>4.9.2 Conservation of energy 
in LC oscillations
</p>
<p>During LC oscillations in LC circuits, 
the energy of the system oscillates between 
the electric field of the capacitor and the 
magnetic field of the inductor. Although, 
these two forms of energy vary with time, 
the total energy remains constant. It 
means that LC oscillations take place in 
accordance with the law of conservation of 
energy.

<p>Let us consider 3 different stages of LC 
oscillations and calculate the total energy of 
the system.

q Qm=  and the current through the

<p>Likewise, the mechanical energy of the 
spring-mass system exists in two forms; 
the potential energy of the compressed or 
extended spring and the kinetic energy of 
the mass. The Table 4.2 lists these two pairs 
of energy.
</p>
<p>By examining the Table 4.2, the analogies 
between the various quantities can be 
understood and these correspondences are 
given in Table 4.3.
</p>
<p>The angular frequency of oscillations of a 
spring-mass is given by (Refer equation 10.22 
of section 10.4.1 of XI physics text book).
</p>
<p>ω =
k
m
</p>
<p>From Table 4.3, k C&rarr; 1  and m L&rarr; .
Therefore, the angular frequency of LC 
oscillations is given by

</p>
<p>	� Whenever the magnetic flux linked with a closed coil changes, an emf is induced 
and hence an electric current flows in the circuit. This phenomenon is known as 
electromagnetic induction. 
</p>
<p>	� Faraday&rsquo;s first law states that whenever magnetic flux linked with a closed circuit 
changes, an emf is induced in the circuit.
</p>
<p>	� Faraday&rsquo;s second law states that the magnitude of induced emf in a closed circuit is 
equal to the time rate of change of magnetic flux linked with the circuit.
</p>
<p>	� Lenz&rsquo;s law states that the direction of the induced current is such that it always 
opposes the cause responsible for its production.
</p>
<p>	� Lenz&rsquo;s law is established on the basis of the law of conservation of energy. 
	� Fleming&rsquo;s right hand rule states that if the index finger points the direction of the 
</p>
<p>magnetic field and the thumb indicates the direction of motion of the conductor, 
then the middle finger will indicate the direction of the induced current. 
</p>
<p>	� Even for a conductor in the form of a sheet or a plate, an emf is induced when magnetic 
flux linked with it changes. The induced currents flow in concentric circular paths 
called Eddy currents or Foucault currents.
</p>
<p>	� Inductor is a device used to store energy in a magnetic field when an electric current 
flows through it.
</p>
<p>	� If the flux linked with the coil is changed, an emf is induced in that same coil. This 
phenomenon is known as self-induction. The emf induced is called self-induced emf.
</p>
<p>	� When an electric current passing through a coil changes with time, an emf is induced 
in the neighbouring coil. This phenomenon is known as mutual induction and the 
emf is called mutually induced emf.
</p>
<p>	� AC generator or alternator is an energy conversion device. It converts mechanical 
energy used to rotate the coil or field magnet into electrical energy. 
</p>
<p>	� In some AC generators, there are three separate coils, which would give three separate 
emfs. Hence they are called three-phase AC generators.
</p>
<p>	� Transformer is a stationary device used to transform AC electric power from one 
circuit to another without changing its frequency. 
</p>
<p>	� The efficiency of a transformer is defined as the ratio of the useful output power to 
the input power.
</p>
<p>	� An alternating voltage is a voltage which changes polarity at regular intervals of time 
and the resulting alternating current changes direction accordingly.
</p>
<p>	� The average value of alternating current is defined as the average of all values of 
current over a positive half-circle or negative half-circle. 
</p>
<p>	� The root mean square value or effective value of an alternating current is defined as 
the square root of the mean of the squares of all currents over one cycle.

</p>
<p>	� A sinusoidal alternating voltage (or current) can be represented by a vector which 
rotates about the origin in anti-clockwise direction at a constant angular velocity. 
Such a rotating vector is called a phasor.
</p>
<p>	� When the frequency of the applied alternating source is equal to the natural frequency 
of the RLC circuit, the current in the circuit reaches its maximum value. Then the 
circuit is said to be in electrical resonance. 
</p>
<p>	� The magnification of voltages at series resonance is termed as Q&ndash;factor.
	� Power of a circuit is defined as the rate of consumption of electric energy in that 
</p>
<p>circuit.  It depends on the components of the circuit.
	� Whenever energy is given to a LC circuit, the electrical oscillations of definite 
</p>
<p>frequency are generated. These oscillations are called LC oscillations.
	� During LC oscillations, the total energy remains constant.  It means that LC 
</p>
<p>oscillations take place in accordance with the law of conservation of energy.

of energy without which human beings 
cannot survive in this planet. Light plays 
crucial role in understanding the structure

INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>and properties of various things from atom 
to universe. Without light, even our eyes 
cannot see objects. What is light?. This puzzle 
made many physicists sleepless until middle 
of 19th century. Earlier, many scientists 
thought that optics and electromagnetism 
are two different branches of physics. But 
from the work of James Clerk Maxwell, who 
actually enlightened the concept of light 
from his theoretical prediction that light 
is an electromagnetic wave which moves 
with the speed equal to 3 &times; 108 ms&ndash;1 (in free 
space or vacuum). Later, it was confirmed 
that visible light is just only small portion 
of electromagnetic spectrum, which ranges 
from gamma rays to radio waves.
</p>
<p>In unit 4, we studied that time varying 
magnetic field produces an electric 
field (Faraday&rsquo;s law of electromagnetic 
induction). Maxwell strongly believed that 
nature must possess symmetry and he asked

<p>In today's digital world, cell phones 
(Figure 5.2 (a)) have greater influence 
in our day to day life. It is a faster and 
more effective mode of transferring 
information from one place to another.  
It works on the basis that light is an 
electromagnetic wave. In hospitals, the 
location of bone fracture can be detected 
using X-rays as shown in Figure 5.2 (b), 
which is also an electromagnetic wave. 
For cooking microwave oven is used. The 
microwave is also an electromagnetic 
wave. There are plenty of applications of 
electromagnetic waves in engineering, 
medicine (example LASER surgery, etc), 
defence (example, RADAR signals) and 
also in fundamental scientific research. 
In this unit, basics of electromagnetic 
waves are discussed.

true. In 1888, H. Hertz experimentally 
verified Maxwell&rsquo;s prediction and 
hence, this understanding resulted in 
new technological invention, especially  
in wireless communication, LASER  
(Light Amplification by Stimulated 
Emission of Radiation) technology, 
RADAR (Radio Detection And Ranging) 
etc.

<p>Ampere&rsquo;s circuital law can be used to find 
the magnetic field produced around the 
current carrying wire.
</p>
<p>To calculate the magnetic field at a point 
P near the wire and outside the capacitor, 
let us draw a circular Amperian loop which 
encloses the circular surface S1 (Figure 5.3). 
Using Ampere&rsquo;s circuital law for this loop, 
we get

</p>
<p>enclosing S1

<p> (5.3)
</p>
<p>where &micro;o is the permeability of free space.

</p>
<p>Now, the same loop is enclosed by 
balloon shaped surface S2 such that 
boundaries of two surfaces S1 and S2 are 
same but the shape of the surfaces is 
different (Figure 5.4). As Ampere&rsquo;s law 
applied for a given closed loop does not 
depend on the shape of the enclosing 
surface, the integrals should give the same 
answer. But by applying Ampere&rsquo;s circuital 
law for the surface S2, we get

<p>� �
� B dl&sdot; =&int; 0
</p>
<p>enclosing S2
</p>
<p> (5.4)
</p>
<p>The right hand side of equation is zero 
because the surface S2 nowhere touches 
the wire carrying conduction current and 
further, there is no current flowing between

<p>From symmetry considerations, James 
Clerk Maxwell showed that the change in 
electric field also produces a magnetic field 
which is given by

</p>
<p>In order to understand how the 
changing electric field induces magnetic 
field, let us consider a situation of charging 
a parallel plate capacitor which contains 
non&minus;conducting medium between the 
plates.
</p>
<p>Let a time&minus;dependent current ic, 
called conduction current be passed 
through the wire to charge the capacitor.

<p> is known as displacement

<p>current or Maxwell&rsquo;s displacement current. 
</p>
<p>The displacement current can be defined 
as the current which comes into play in the 
region in which the electric field (or the 
electric flux) is changing with time. In other 
words, whenever the change in electric field 
takes place, displacement current is produced.

<p>where the total current enclosed by the surface 
becomes the sum of conduction current and 
displacement current. Therefore, = +c di i i .  
The equation (5.6) is known as Ampere&minus;
Maxwell law. When the current in the 
circuit is constant, the displacement current 
is zero. 
</p>
<p>Between the plates, the conduction 
current is zero while the displacement current 
is non&minus;zero. This displacement current or 
time&minus;varying electric field can also produce 
a magnetic field between the plates of the 
capacitor. The magnetic field at a point inside 
the capacitor is perpendicular to the electric 
field and is shown in Figure 5.6. This magnetic 
field can be determined using equation (5.6).  
</p>
<p>the plates of the capacitor (gap between the 
plates). So the magnetic field at a point P 
is zero. Hence there is an inconsistency 
between equations (5.3) and (5.4).
</p>
<p>Maxwell resolved this inconsistency 
as follows: While the capacitor is being 
charged up, varying electric field is 
produced between capacitor plates. There 
must be a current associated with the 
changing electric field between capacitor 
plates. In other words, time&minus;varying 
electric field (or time&minus;varying electric 
flux) produces a current. This is known as 
displacement current flowing between the 
plates of the capacitor (Figure 5.5).

<p>5.1.2 Maxwell&rsquo;s equations in 
integral form
</p>
<p>Electrodynamics can be summarized in 
four basic equations, known as Maxwell&rsquo;s 
equations. These equations are analogous 
to Newton&rsquo;s equations in mechanics. 
Maxwell&rsquo;s equations completely explain 
the behaviour of charges, currents and 
properties of electric and magnetic 
fields. These equations can be written in 
integral form (or integration form) or 
derivative form (or differential form). The 
</p>
<p>Importance of Maxwell&rsquo;s correction:
Earth receives radiations from Sun and 
</p>
<p>other stars. These radiations travel through 
empty space where there are no electric 
charges and hence no electric current. 
Ampere&rsquo;s law says that only electric current 
can produce a magnetic field. If Ampere&rsquo;s law 
alone is true, there will not be any radiation.

</p>
<p>e
</p>
<p>in Ampere&rsquo;s law ensures that time&minus;varying 
electric field or displacement current can 
also produce a magnetic field. Though 
conduction current is zero in an empty 
space, displacement current does exist. So, 
the equation (5.6) becomes
</p>

<p>l
</p>
<p>B.dl = Φ&micro;&int;
 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>e
</p>
<p>In stars, due to thermal excitation 
of atoms, time&minus;varying electric field is 
produced which in turn, produces time&minus;
varying magnetic field. According to 
Faraday&rsquo;s law, this time&minus;varying magnetic 
field produces again time&minus;varying electric 
field and so on. The coupled time&minus;varying 
electric and magnetic fields travel through 
empty space with the speed of light and is 
called electromagnetic wave. 
</p>
<p>Even though Maxwell initially started 
with purely symmetry argument, his 
correction term explains one of the important 
aspects of the universe, namely the existence 
of electromagnetic waves.
</p>
<p>Displacement current
The name stuck because 
Maxwell named it. The word 
</p>
<p>displacement is poorly chosen because 
nothing is being displaced here.

It is Faraday&rsquo;s law of electromagnetic

with the changing magnetic flux which is 
mathematically written as

<p>B&sdot; =&minus;&int; Φ (Faraday&rsquo;s law)  (5.9)

<p>E  is the electric field. This 
equation implies that the line integral of 
the electric field around any closed path 
is equal to the rate of change of magnetic 
flux through the closed path bounded by 
the surface. 
</p>
<p>Our modern technological revolution 
is due to Faraday&rsquo;s laws of electromagnetic 
induction. 
</p>
<p>Fourth equation 
It is modified Ampere&rsquo;s circuital law. 
</p>
<p>This is also known as Ampere &ndash; Maxwell 
law. This law relates the magnetic field 
around any closed path to the conduction 
current and displacement current through 
that path.

<p>where

<p>B is the magnetic field. This equation 
shows that both conduction current and 
displacement current produce magnetic field. 
</p>
<p>These four equations are known as 
Maxwell&rsquo;s equations in electrodynamics. 
This equation ensures the existence 
of electromagnetic waves. The entire 
communication system in the world 
depends on electromagnetic waves. In fact 
our understanding of stars, galaxy, planets 
etc come by analysing the electromagnetic 
waves emitted by these astronomical objects.
</p>
<p>differential form of Maxwell&rsquo;s equation 
is beyond higher secondary level. So we 
focus only the integral form of Maxwell&rsquo;s 
equations.
</p>
<p>First equation
It is nothing but the Gauss&rsquo;s law of 
</p>
<p>electricity. It relates the net electric flux to 
net electric charge enclosed in a surface. 
Mathematically, it is expressed as

</p>
<p>(5.7)
</p>
<p>where 

</p>
<p>E is the electric field and Q enclosed 
is the net charge enclosed by the surface S. 
This equation is true for both discrete and 
continuous distribution of charges. 
</p>
<p>It also indicates that the electric field 
lines start from positive charge and 
terminate at negative charge. This implies 
that the electric field lines do not form a 
continuous closed path. In other words, it 
means that an isolated positive charge or 
negative charge can exist.
</p>
<p> Second equation 
This law is similar to Gauss&rsquo;s law for 
</p>
<p>electricity. So this law can also be called 
as Gauss&rsquo;s law for magnetism. The surface 
integral of magnetic field over a closed 
surface is zero. Mathematically,

</p>
<p>(Gauss&rsquo;s law for magnetism)
 
(5.8)
</p>
<p>where 

</p>
<p>B is the magnetic field. 
This equation implies that the magnetic 
</p>
<p>lines of force form a continuous closed path. 
In other words, it means that no isolated 
magnetic monopole exists.

is transmitted from electrode to the receiver

as electromagnetic waves.

no spark is observed by the receiver. This 
confirms that electromagnetic waves are 
transverse waves as predicted by Maxwell.

wave is a non-mechanical wave.

<p>Production of electromagnetic waves - Hertz 
experiment
</p>
<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s prediction was experimentally 
confirmed by Heinrich Rudolf Hertz in 
1888. The experimental set up used is shown 
in Figure 5.7 (b). 
</p>
<p>It consists of two metal electrodes which 
are made of small spherical metals. These are 
connected to larger spheres and the ends of 
them are connected to induction coil with 
very large number of turns. This is to produce 
very high electromotive force (emf). 
</p>
<p>Since the coil is maintained at very high 
potential, air between the electrodes gets 
ionized and spark (spark means discharge 
of electricity) is produced. This discharge 
of electricity affects another electrode (ring

<p>&bull; It is surprising to realize that EM waves have linear momentum and angular 
momentum like particles. In the year 2018, Nobel prize in physics was awarded 
for the invention of optical tweezers and production of high intense light pulses. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Optical tweezer is nothing but a laser light, used to move micro sized particles or 
molecules from one location to another location. It has a lot of applications in the medical 
field. The bacteria and virus can alone be separated from regular tissue using this optical 
tweezer and cancerous cells can be separated from normal healthy cells. The optical tweezer 
utilizes  momentum property of EM waves.  
&bull; In fact, the comet has tail shape because the sun light impart large amount of linear 
momentum which pushes the masses of the comet away from the sun.
&bull; Angular momentum of EM waves can be understood in simple way. Consider a setup of 
oppositely-charged coaxial cylindrical shells and in between them a solenoid is kept. An AC current 
is flowing through it and when the current in the solenoid is reduced to zero, then the inner and 
outer cylindrical shells start to rotate in opposite directions. The rotation of these cylinders is due to 
the impart of angular momentum from the electromagnetic field produced by the AC current.

<p>particle accelerates, it produces magnetic 
field in addition to electric field. Both 
electric and magnetic fields are time 
varying fields. Since the electromagnetic 
waves are transverse waves, the direction 
of propagation of electromagnetic waves 
is perpendicular to the planes containing 
electric and magnetic field vectors.
</p>
<p>Any oscillatory motion is also an 
accelerated motion. So, when the charge 
oscillates (oscillating molecular dipole) 
about their mean position (Figure 5.9), it 
produces electromagnetic waves. 
</p>
<p>Suppose the electromagnetic field in 
free space propagates along z-direction 
and if the electric field vector points along 
x-axis, then the magnetic field vector will 
be mutually perpendicular to both electric 
field and the direction of wave propagation.

<p>Any stationary charge produces only

produces steady current which gives rise to

<p>Electromagnetic spectrum is an orderly 
distribution of electromagnetic waves in terms 
of wavelength or frequency (Figure 5.10).
Radio waves
</p>
<p>They are produced by accelerated 
motion of charges in conducting wires. The  
frequency range is from a few Hz to 109 Hz.  
They show reflection and diffraction.
</p>
<p>They are used in radio and television 
communication systems and also in cellular 
phones to transmit voice communication 
in the ultra high frequency band. 
Microwaves
</p>
<p>It is produced by special vacuum tubes 
such as klystron, magnetron and gunndiode. 
The frequency range of microwaves is 109 Hz 
to 1011 Hz.These waves undergo reflection 
and can be polarised. 
</p>
<p>It is used in radar system for aircraft 
navigation, speed of the vehicle, microwave 
oven for cooking and very long distance 
wireless communication through satellites.
Infrared radiation
</p>
<p>It is produced by hot bodies (also 
known as heat waves) and also by when 
the molecules undergoing rotational and 
vibrational transitions. The frequency range 
is 1011 Hz to 4 &times; 1014 Hz. 
</p>
<p>It provides electrical energy to satellites 
by means of solar cells. It is used to produce 
</p>
<p>wave and k (unit vector, here it is called 
propagation vector) denotes the direction of 
propagation of electromagnetic wave. 
</p>
<p>Note that both electric field and 
magnetic field oscillate with a frequency 
(frequency of electromagnetic wave) which 
is equal to the frequency of the source 
(here, oscillating charge is the source for 
the production of electromagnetic waves).  
In free space or in vacuum, the ratio 
between Eo and Bo is equal to the speed of 
electromagnetic wave and is equal to speed 
of light c.

</p>
<p>Further, the energy of electromagnetic

</p>
<p>Compute the speed of the electromagnetic 
wave in a medium if the amplitude of 
electric and magnetic fields are 3 &times; 104 N C&ndash;1

</p>
<p>The amplitude of the electric field,  
Eo = 3 &times; 104 N C&ndash;1

<p>The amplitude of the magnetic field,

<p>It has less penetrating power. It can be 
absorbed by atmospheric ozone and is harmful 
to human body. It is used to destroy bacteria 
in sterilizing the surgical instruments, burglar 
alarm, to detect the invisible writing, finger 
prints and also in the study of atomic structure. 
</p>
<p>X-rays
It is produced when there is sudden 
</p>
<p>stopping of high speed electrons at high-
atomic number target, and also by electronic 
transitions among the innermost orbits of 
atoms. The frequency range of X-rays is 
from 1017 Hz to 1019 Hz. 
</p>
<p>X-rays have more penetrating power 
than ultraviolet radiation. X-rays are used 
extensively in studying structures of inner 
atomic electron shells and crystal structures.  
It is used in detecting fractures, diseased 
organs, formation of bones and stones, 
</p>
<p>dehydrated fruits, in green houses to keep 
the plants warm, heat therapy for muscular 
pain or sprain, TV remote as a signal carrier, 
to look through haze fog or mist and used in 
night vision or infrared photography. 
Visible light
</p>
<p>It is produced by incandescent bodies 
and also it is radiated by excited atoms 
in gases. The frequency range is from  
4 &times; 1014 Hz to 8 &times; 1014 Hz. 
</p>
<p>It obeys the laws of reflection and refraction. 
It undergoes interference, diffraction and can 
be polarised. It exhibits photo-electric effect 
also. It can be used to study the structure of 
molecules, arrangement of electrons in external 
shells of atoms. It causes sensation of vision. 
Ultraviolet radiation
</p>
<p>It is produced by Sun, arc and ionized 
gases. Its frequency range is from   
8 &times; 1014 Hz to 1017 Hz. 
</p>
<p>Measuring the speed of light using the microwave oven
Nowadays the microwave oven is very commonly used to heat the food items. Micro waves 
of wavelengths 1 mm to 30 cm are produced in these ovens. Such waves form the standing 
waves between the interior walls of the oven. It is interesting to note that the speed of light 
can be measured using micro wave oven.

</p>
<p>             (c) (d)
</p>
<p>We studied about the standing waves in XI physics, Volume 2, Unit 11. The standing waves 
have nodes and antinodes at fixed points. At node point, the amplitude of the wave is zero 
and at antinodes point, the amplitude is maximum. In other words, the maximal energy of 
microwaves is located at antinode points. When we keep some food items like chappathi or 
choclate (after removing the rotating platform) inside the oven, we can notice that at antinode 
locations, chappathi will be burnt more than other locations. It is shown in the Figure (c) 
and (d). The distance between two successive burnt spots will give the half wavelength of 
microwave. The frequency of microwave is printed in the panel of oven. By knowing wavelength 
and frequency of microwaves, using the formula vλ = c, we can calculate the speed of light c.

for heating and cooking food because they 
are strongly absorbed by water molecules.

TYPES OF SPECTRUM-  
EMISSION AND 
ABSORPTION SPECTRUM- 
FRAUNHOFER LINES
</p>
<p>When an object burns, 
it emits radiations. That is, 
it emits electromagnetic 
radiation which depends on 
temperature. If the object 
becomes hot, it glows in 
red colour. If the temperature of the object is 
further increased, then it glows in reddish-
orange colour and becomes white when it is 
hottest. The spectrum in Figure 5.11 usually 
</p>
<p>observing the progress of healing bones. 
Further, in a finished metal product, it is 
used to detect faults, cracks, flaws and holes. 
Gamma rays
</p>
<p>It is produced by transitions of 
radioactive nuclei and decay of certain 
elementary particles. They produce 
chemical reactions on photographic plates, 
fluorescence, ionisation, diffraction. The 
frequency range is 1018 Hz and above. 
</p>
<p>Gamma rays have higher penetrating 
power than X-rays and ultraviolet radiations; 
it has no charge but harmful to human body. 
Gamma rays provide information about the 
structure of atomic nuclei. It is used in radio 
therapy for the treatment of cancer and 
tumour, in food industry to kill pathogenic 
microorganism.
</p>

<p>emission spectrum. The emission spectrum 
can be divided into three types:
</p>
<p>(i)  Continuous emission spectrum (or 
continuous spectrum)
If the light from incandescent lamp 
</p>
<p>(filament bulb) is allowed to pass through 
prism (simplest spectroscope), it splits 
up into seven colours. Thus, it consists 
of wavelengths containing all the visible 
colours ranging from violet to red (Figure 
5.13). Examples: spectrum obtained from 
carbon arc and incandescent solids. 
</p>
<p>(ii)  Line emission spectrum (or line 
spectrum):
</p>
<p>Suppose light from hot gas is allowed 
to pass through prism, line spectrum is 
observed (Figure 5.14). Line spectra are also 
known as discontinuous spectra. The line 
spectra consists of  sharp lines of definite 
wavelengths or frequencies. Such spectra 
arise due to excited atoms of elements. These 
lines are the characteristics of the element 
and are different for different elements. 
Examples: spectra of atomic hydrogen, 
helium, etc.
</p>
<p>(iii)  Band emission spectrum (or band 
spectrum)
</p>
<p>Band spectrum consists of several 
number of very closely spaced spectral lines 
which overlap together forming specific 
</p>
<p>is called black body spectrum (Refer XI 
Physics Unit 8). It is a continuous frequency 
(or wavelength) curve depending on the 
body&rsquo;s temperature.
</p>
<p>Suppose we allow a beam of white light to 
pass through the prism (as shown in Figure 
5.12). It is split into its seven constituent 
colours which can be viewed on the screen 
as continuous spectrum. This phenomenon 
is known as dispersion of light and the 
definite pattern of colours obtained on the 
screen after dispersion is called as spectrum. 
The spectra can be broadly classified into 
two catagories:
</p>
<p>Figure 5.12 White light passed through 
prism &ndash; dispersion

When the spectrum of self luminous

</p>
<p>known as Fraunhofer lines (Figure 5.16). The 
absorption spectra for various materials are 
compared with the Fraunhofer lines in the 
solar spectrum, which helps in identifying 
elements present in the Sun&rsquo;s atmosphere. 
</p>
<p>Fraunhofer lines
When the spectrum obtained from the 
</p>
<p>Sun is examined, it consists of large number 
of dark lines (line absorption spectrum). 
These dark lines in the solar spectrum are 
</p>
<p>bands which are separated by dark spaces. 
This spectrum has a sharp edge at one end 
and fades out at the other end. Such spectra 
arise when the molecules are excited. 
Band spectrum is the characteristic of the 
molecule and hence the structure of the 
molecules can be studied using their band 
spectra. Example: spectra of ammonia gas 
in the discharge tube etc.
</p>
<p>(b) Absorption spectra
When light is allowed to pass through 
</p>
<p>a medium or an absorbing substance 
then the spectrum obtained is known as 
absorption spectrum. It is the characteristic 
of absorbing substance. Absorption 
spectrum is classified into three types:
</p>
<p>(i) Continuous absorption spectrum
</p>
<p>When we pass white light through a blue 
glass plate, it absorbs all the colours except 
blue and gives continuous absorption 
spectrum.
</p>
<p>Figure 5.15 line absorption spectra
</p>
<p>Cold gas Absorption spectrum
</p>
<p>(ii) Line absorption spectrum
</p>
<p>When light from the incandescent lamp 
is passed through cold gas (medium), the 
spectrum obtained through the dispersion 
due to prism is line absorption spectrum 
(Figure 5.15). Similarly, if the light from 
the carbon arc is made to pass through 
sodium vapour, a continuous spectrum 
of carbon arc with two dark lines in the 
yellow region  are obtained. 
</p>
<p>(iii) Band absorption spectrum
</p>
<p>When white light is passed through the 
iodine vapour, dark bands on continuous

<p>	� Displacement current can be defined as &lsquo;the current which comes into play in the 
region in which the electric field and the electric flux are changing with time&rsquo;.

</p>
<p>	� An electromagnetic wave is radiated by an accelerated charge which propagates 
through space as coupled electric and magnetic fields, oscillating perpendicular to 
each other and to the direction of propagation of the wave.
</p>
<p>	� Electromagnetic waves are non-mechanical and do not require any medium for 
propagation.
</p>
<p>	� The instantaneous magnitude of the electric and magnetic field vectors in 
electromagnetic wave are related by c = E / B.
</p>
<p>	� Electromagnetic waves can show interference, diffraction and also can be polarized
</p>
<p>	� Electromagnetic waves carry not only energy and momentum but also angular 
momentum. 
</p>
<p>	� Types of spectra: emission and absorption spectra.
</p>
<p>	� When the spectrum of self luminous source is taken, we get emission spectrum. Each 
source has its own characteristic emission spectrum. The emission spectrum can be 
divided into three types: continuous, line and band.
</p>
<p>	� When the spectrum obtained from the Sun is examined, it consists of a large number 
of dark lines (line absorption spectrum). These dark lines in the solar spectrum are 
known as Fraunhofer lines.

<p> &bull; A Lechlanche cell is connected across the wire of length 1 m through a key.
</p>
<p> &bull;  A sensitive galvanometer G is connected between the central strip and the jockey through a 
high resistance (HR).
</p>
<p> &bull; With a suitable resistance included in the resistance box, the circuit is switched on.  
</p>
<p> &bull;  To check the circuit connections, the jockey is pressed near one end of the wire, say A.  
The galvanometer will show deflection in one direction. When the jockey is pressed near the 
other end of the wire B, the galvanometer will show deflection in the opposite direction.  
This ensures that the circuit connections are correct.

<p>RESULT

</p>
<p>Note:
</p>
<p>i)  To check the circuit connections:
</p>
<p>  The meter bridge wire is touched near one end (say, end A) with jockey, galvanometer 
shows a deflection in any one direction. Now the other end (say, end B) is touched. If the 
galvanometer shows a deflection in the opposite direction, then the circuit connections are 
correct.
</p>
<p>ii)  The usage of high resistance (HR):
</p>
<p>  The galvanometer is a very sensitive device. If any high current flows through the galvanom-
eter, its coil gets damaged. Therefore in order to protect the galvanometer, a high resistance 
(HR) is used. When HR is connected in series with the galvanometer, the current through it 
is reduced so that the galvanometer is protected. But the balancing length is not accurate.
</p>
<p>iii) To find the accurate balancing length:
</p>
<p>  The HR is first included in the circuit (that is, the plug key in HR is removed), the approx-
imate balancing length is found. Now HR is excluded in the circuit (that is, the plug key in 
HR is closed), then the accurate balancing length is found.

<p>PROCEDURE
</p>
<p>&bull;   The preliminary adjustments are carried out as follows.
</p>
<p> a.  The leveling screws at the base of TG are adjusted so that the circular turn table is horizontal 
and the plane of the circular coil is vertical.
</p>
<p> b.  The circular coil is rotated so that its plane is in the magnetic meridian i.e., along the north-
south direction. 
</p>
<p> c.  The compass box alone is rotated till the aluminium pointer reads 0 0&deg; &minus; &deg;.
</p>
<p>&bull;   The connections are made as shown in Figure (c). 
</p>
<p>&bull;  The number of turns n is selected and the circuit is switched on. 
</p>
<p>&bull;  The range of current through TG is chosen in such a way that the deflection of the aluminium 
pointer lies between 30 60&deg; &minus; &deg;. 
</p>
<p>&bull;  A suitable current is allowed to pass through the circuit, the deflections θ1 and θ2 are noted from 
two ends of the aluminium pointer. 
</p>
<p>&bull;  Now the direction of current is reversed using commutator C, the deflections θ3 and θ4 in the 
opposite directions are noted.
</p>
<p>&bull;  The mean value θ of θ1, θ2, θ3 and θ4 is calculated and tabulated.
</p>
<p>&bull;  The reduction factor k is calculated for each case and it is found that k is a constant.
</p>
<p>&bull;  The experiment is repeated for various values of current and the readings are noted and tabulated. 
</p>
<p>&bull;  The radius of the circular coil is found by measuring the circumference of the coil using a thread 
around the coil.  
</p>
<p>&bull;  From the values of r, n and k, the horizontal component of Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field is determined.
</p>
<p>Commutator:
</p>
<p>It is a kind of switch employed in electrical circuits, electric motors and electric  
generators. It is used to reverse the direction of current in the circuit.

<p>PROCEDURE
</p>
<p>1) Initial adjustments of the spectrometer
</p>
<p> &bull;  Eye-piece: The eye-piece of the telescope is adjusted so that the cross-wires are seen clearly. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Slit: The slit of the collimator is adjusted such that it is very thin and vertical. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Base of the spectrometer: The base of the spectrometer is adjusted to be horizontal using 
leveling screws.
</p>
<p> &bull;  Telescope: The telescope is turned towards a distant object and is adjusted till the clear 
inverted image of the distant object is seen. Now the telescope is adjusted to receive parallel 
rays.
</p>
<p> &bull;  Collimator: The telescope is brought in line with the collimator. Collimator is adjusted until a 
clear image of the slit is seen in the telescope. Now the collimator gives parallel rays.
</p>
<p> &bull;  Prism table: Using a spirit level, the prism table is adjusted to be horizontal with the three 
leveling screws provided in the prism table.
</p>
<p>2) Determination of angle of the prism (A)
</p>
<p>	 &bull;  The slit is illuminated by yellow light from sodium vapour lamp.
</p>
<p>	 &bull;  The given equilateral prism is placed on the prism table in such a way that refracting edge of 
the prism is facing the collimator.
</p>
<p> &bull;  The light emerging from the collimator is incident on both reflecting faces of the prism and is 
reflected.
</p>
<p> &bull;  The telescope is rotated towards left to obtain reflected image of the slit from face 1 of the 
prism and is fixed. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  Using tangential screws, the telescope is adjusted until the vertical cross-wire coincides with 
the reflected image of the slit.
</p>
<p> &bull;  The main scale reading and vernier coincidence are noted from both vernier scales. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  The telescope is now rotated towards right to obtain the reflected image from face 2 of the 
prism. As before, the readings are taken. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  The difference between the two readings gives 2A from which the angle of the prism A is 
calculated.
</p>
<p>3) Determination of angle of minimum deviation (D)
</p>
<p> &bull;  The prism table is rotated such that the light emerging from the collimator is incident on one 
of the refracting faces of the prism, gets refracted and emerges out from the other refracting 
face. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  The telescope is turned to view the refracted image.
</p>
<p> &bull;  Looking through the telescope, the prism table is rotated in such a direction that the image 
moves towards the direct ray.
</p>

</p>
<p> &bull;  At one particular position, the refracted ray begins to retrace its path. The position where the 
refracted image returns is the position of minimum deviation.
</p>
<p> &bull;  The telescope is fixed in this position and is adjusted until the vertical cross-wire coincides 
with the refracted image of the slit.
</p>
<p> &bull;  The readings are taken from both vernier scales.
</p>
<p> &bull;  The prism is now removed and the telescope is rotated to obtain the direct ray image and the 
readings are taken. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  The readings are tabulated and the difference between these two readings gives the angle of 
minimum deviation D.
</p>
<p> &bull;  From the values of A and D, the refractive index of the material of the glass prism is deter-
mined.

<p>	 &bull;  Telescope: The telescope is turned towards a distant object and is adjusted till the clear image 
of the distant object is seen. Now the telescope is adjusted to receive parallel rays.
</p>
<p>	 &bull;  Collimator: The telescope is brought in line with the collimator. Collimator is adjusted until a 
clear image of the slit is seen in the telescope. Now the collimator gives parallel rays.
</p>
<p>	 &bull;  Grating table: Using a spirit level, the grating table is adjusted to be horizontal with the three 
leveling screws provided in the grating table.
</p>
<p>2) Adjustment of the grating for normal incidence
</p>
<p>	 &bull; The slit is illuminated with a composite light (white light) from mercury vapour lamp.
</p>
<p>	 &bull;  The telescope is brought in line with the collimator. The vertical cross-wire is made to coin-
cide with the image of the slit (Figure (a)1). 
</p>
<p>	 &bull;  The vernier disc alone is rotated till the vernier scale reads 00 - 1800 and is fixed. This is the 
reading for the direct ray.
</p>
<p>	 &bull; The telescope is then rotated (anti-clockwise) through an angle of 900 and fixed (Figure (a)2). 
</p>
<p>	 &bull; Now the plane transmission grating is mounted on the grating table.
</p>
<p>	 &bull;  The grating table alone is rotated so that the light reflected from the grating coincides with 
vertical cross-wire of the telescope. The reflected image is white in colour (Figure (a)3).
</p>
<p>	 &bull;  Now the vernier disc is released. The vernier disc along with grating table is rotated through 
an angle of 450 in the appropriate direction such that the light from the collimator is incident 
normally on the grating (Figure (a)4).
</p>
<p>3) Determination of wave length of the constituent colours of the mercury spectrum 
</p>
<p>	 &bull;  The telescope is released and is brought in line with the collimator to receive central direct 
image. This undispersed image is white in colour.
</p>
<p>	 &bull; The diffracted images of the slit are observed on either side of the direct image.
</p>
<p>	 &bull;  The diffracted image consists of the prominent colours of mercury spectrum in increasing 
order of wavelength.
</p>
<p>	 &bull;  The telescope is turned to any one side (say left) of direct image to observe first order dif-
fracted image. 
</p>
<p>	 &bull;  The vertical cross-wire is made to coincide with the prominent spectral lines (violet, blue, 
yellow and red) and the readings of both vernier scales for each case are noted.
</p>
<p>	 &bull;  Now the telescope is rotated to the right side of the direct image and the first order image is 
observed.
</p>
<p>	 &bull;  The vertical cross-wire is made to coincide with the same prominent spectral lines and the 
readings of both vernier scales for each case are again noted.
</p>
<p>	 &bull;  The readings are tabulated.
</p>
<p>	 &bull;  The difference between these two readings gives the value of 2θ for the particular spectral line.
</p>
<p>	 &bull;  The number of lines per metre length of the given grating N is noted from the grating.
</p>
<p>	 &bull;  From the values of N, n and θ, the wave length of the prominent colours of the mercury light 
is determined using the given formula.

<p>PROCEDURE
</p>
<p>i) Forward bias characteristics
</p>
<p> &bull;  In the forward bias, the P- region of the diode is connected to the positive terminal and  
N-region to the negative terminal of the DC power supply.
</p>
<p> &bull; The connections are given as per the circuit diagram.
</p>
<p> &bull;  The voltage across the diode can be varied with the help of the variable DC power supply.
</p>
<p> &bull;  The forward voltage (VF) across the diode is increased from 0.1 V in steps of 0.1 V up to  
0.8 V and the forward current (IF) through the diode is noted from the milli-ammeter.  
The readings are tabulated.
</p>
<p> &bull;  The forward voltage VF and the forward current IF are taken as positive.
</p>
<p> &bull;  A graph is drawn taking the forward voltage (VF) along the x-axis and the forward current 
(IF) along the y-axis. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  The voltage corresponding to the dotted line in the forward characteristics gives the knee 
voltage or threshold voltage or turn-on voltage of the diode. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  The slope in the linear portion of the forward characteristics is calculated. The reciprocal of 
the slope gives the forward resistance of the diode. 
</p>
<p>ii) Reverse bias characteristics
</p>
<p> &bull;  In the reverse bias, the polarity of the DC power supply is reversed so that the P- region of 
the diode is connected to the negative terminal and N-region to the positive terminal of the 
DC power supply
</p>
<p> &bull; The connections are made as given in the circuit diagram.
</p>
<p> &bull;  The voltage across the diode can be varied with the help of the variable DC power supply.
</p>
<p> &bull;  The reverse voltage (VR) across the diode is increased from 1 V in steps of 1 V up to 5 V and 
the reverse current (IR) through the diode is noted from the micro-ammeter. The readings are 
tabulated.
</p>
<p> &bull; The reverse voltage VR and reverse current IR are taken as negative.
</p>
<p> &bull;  A graph is drawn taking the reverse bias voltage (VR) along negative x-axis and the reverse 
bias current (IR) along negative y-axis.

</p>
<p>Practical Tips
</p>
<p>&bull;	 	The DC power supply voltage should be increased only up to the specified range in the for-
ward (0 &ndash; 2V) and reverse (0 &ndash; 15V) directions. Forward bias offers very low resistance and 
hence an external resistance of 470Ω is connected as a safety measure.  
</p>
<p>&bull;	 	The voltage applied beyond this limit may damage the resistance or the diode.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 	In the forward bias, the current flow will be almost zero till it crosses the junction  
potential or knee voltage (approximately 0.7 V). Once knee voltage is crossed, the current 
increases with the applied voltage.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 	The diode voltage in the forward direction should be increased in steps of 0.1 V to  
a maximum of 0.8 V after the threshold voltage to calculate the forward resistance.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 	The diode voltage in the reverse direction is increased in steps of 1 V to a maximum of 5 V. 
The current must be measured using micro-ammeter as the strength of current in the  
reverse direction is very less. This is due to the flow of the minority charge carriers called  
the leakage current.

gion to the negative terminal of the DC power supply.
</p>
<p> &bull;  The connections are given as per the circuit diagram.
</p>
<p> &bull;  The voltage across the diode can be varied with the help of the variable DC power supply.
</p>
<p> &bull;  The forward voltage (VF) across the diode is increased from 0.1V in steps of 0.1V up to 0.8V 
and the forward current (IF) through the diode is noted from the milli-ammeter. The read-
ings are tabulated.
</p>
<p> &bull;  The forward voltage and the forward current are taken as positive.
</p>
<p> &bull;  A graph is drawn taking the forward voltage along the x-axis and the forward current along 
the y-axis.

the slope gives the forward resistance of the diode. 
</p>
<p>ii) Reverse bias characteristics
</p>
<p> &bull;  In the reverse bias, the polarity of the DC power supply is reversed so that the P- region of 
the diode is connected to the negative terminal and N-region to the positive terminal of the 
DC power supply
</p>
<p> &bull;  The connections are made as given in the circuit diagram.
</p>
<p> &bull;  The voltage across the diode can be varied with the help of the variable DC power supply.
</p>
<p> &bull;  The reverse voltage (VR) across the diode is increased from 0.5V in steps of 0.5V up to 6V 
and the reverse current (IR) through the diode is noted from the milli-ammeter. The readings 
are tabulated.
</p>
<p> &bull;  Initially, the voltage is increased in steps of 0.5V. When the breakdown region is approxi-
mately reached, then the input voltage may be raised in steps of, say 0.1V to find the break-
down voltage.
</p>
<p> &bull;  The reverse voltage and reverse current are taken as negative.
</p>
<p> &bull;  A graph is drawn taking the reverse bias voltage along negative x-axis and the reverse bias 
current along negative y-axis. 
</p>
<p> &bull;  In the reverse bias, Zener breakdown occurs at a particular voltage called Zener voltage VZ 
(~5.6 to 5.8V) and a large amount of current flows through the diode which is the character-
istics of a Zener diode.
</p>
<p> &bull;  The breakdown voltage of the Zener diode is determined from the graph as shown.

</p>
<p>&bull;	 The voltage applied beyond this limit may damage the resistor or the diode.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 	Zener diode functions like an ordinary PN junction diode in the forward direction.  
Hence the forward characteristic is the same for both PN junction diode and Zener diode. 
Therefore, knee voltage and forward resistance can be determined as explained in the  
previous experiment.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 	Unlike ordinary PN junction diode, the reverse current in Zener diode is measured using 
milli-ammeter due to the large flow of current.

<p>and is directed inwards. A part of the loop is in 
the magnetic field while the remaining part is 
outside the field as shown in Figure A4.1. 
</p>
<p>When the loop is pulled with a constant 
velocity v
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p> to the right, the area of the portion of 
the loop within the magnetic field will decrease. 
Thus, the flux linked with the loop will also 
decrease. According to Faraday&rsquo;s law, an electric 
current is induced in the loop which flows in a 
direction so as to oppose the pull of the loop.
</p>
<p>Let x be the length of the loop which is still 
within the magnetic field, then its area is lx .

</p>
<p>When the current is passed through the 
loop, the torque is produced. If the torque 
acting on the loop is increased then the loop 
will start to rotate. The loop will start to lift 
if and only if the magnitude of magnetic 
torque due to current applied equals to the 
gravitational torque as shown in Figure
