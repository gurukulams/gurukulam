###   <u> INTRODUCTION </u>

Electromagnetism is one of the most
important branches of physics. The
technological developments of the modern
21st century are primarily due to our
understanding of electromagnetism. The
forces we experience in everyday life are
electromagnetic in nature except gravity.

In standard XI, we studied about the
gravitational force, tension, friction, normal
force etc. Newton treated them to be
independent of each other with each force
being a separate natural force. But what is the
origin of all these forces? It is now understood
that except gravity, all forces which we
experience in every day life (tension in the
string, normal force from the surface, friction
etc.) arise from electromagnetic forces within
the atoms. Some examples are

**(i)** When an object is pushed, the atoms
in our hand interact with the atoms in
the object and this interaction is basically
electromagnetic in nature.

**(ii)** When we stand on Earth's surface, the
gravitational force on us acts downwards
and the normal force acts upward to counter
balance the gravitational force. What is the
origin of this normal force?

It arises due to the electromagnetic
interaction of atoms on the surface of the
Earth with the atoms present in the feet of
the person. Though, we are attracted by the
gravitational force of the Earth, we stand on
Earth only because of electromagnetic force
of atoms.

**(iii)** When an object is moved on a surface,
static friction resists the motion of the
object. This static friction arises due to
electromagnetic interaction between the
atoms present in the object and atoms on
the surface. Kinetic friction also has similar
origin.

From these examples, it is clear that
understanding electromagnetism is very
essential to understand the universe in
a holistic manner. The basic principles
of electromagnetism are dealt with
in volume 1 at XII standard physics.
This unit deals with the behaviour and other
related phenomena of charges at rest. This
**branch of electricity which deals with stationary charges is called Electrostatics.**

### <u>  1.1.1 Historical background of electric charges </u>

Two millenniums ago, Greeks noticed
that amber (a solid, translucent material
formed from the resin of a fossilized tree)
after rubbing with animal fur attracted
small pieces of leaves and dust. The amber
possessing this property is said to be
‘charged’. It was initially thought that amber
has this special property. Later people found
that not only amber but even a glass rod
rubbed with silk cloth, attracts pieces of
papers. So glass rod also becomes ‘charged’
when rubbed with a suitable material.

      Consider a charged rubber rod hanging
from a thread as shown in Figure 1.1. Suppose
another charged rubber rod is brought near
the first rubber rod; the rods repel each other.
Now if we bring a charged glass rod close to
the charged rubber rod, they attract each
other. At the same time, if a charged glass rod
is brought near another charged glass rod,
both the rods repel each other.

From these observations, the following
inferences are made

**(i)** The charging of rubber rod and that of
glass rod are different from one another.

**(ii)** The charged rubber rod repels another
charged rubber rod, which implies
that ‘like charges repel each other’. We
can also arrive at the same inference
by observing that a charged glass rod
repels another charged glass rod.

**(iii)** The charged rubber rod attracts the
charged glass rod, implying that the
charge in the glass rod is not the same
kind of charge present in the rubber.
Thus unlike charges attract each other.
Therefore, two kinds of charges exist
in the universe. In the 18th century, Benjamin
Franklin called one type of charge as
positive (+) and another type of charge as
negative (–). Based on Franklin’s convention,
rubber and amber rods are negatively
charged while the glass rod is positively
charged. **If the net charge is zero in the object, it is said to be electrically neutral.**

Following the pioneering work of
J. J. Thomson and E. Rutherford, in the late
19th century and in the beginning of 20th
century, we now understand that the atom
is electrically neutral and is made up of
the negatively charged electrons, positively
charged protons, and neutrons which have
zero charge. The material objects made
up of atoms are neutral in general. When
an object is rubbed with another object
(for example rubber with silk cloth), some
amount of charge is transferred from
one object to another due to the friction
between them and the object is then
said to be electrically charged. **Charging the objects through rubbing is called triboelectric charging.**

### <u>  Basic properties of charges </u>

**(i)** Electric charge
Most objects in the universe are made
up of atoms, which in turn are made up
of protons, neutrons and electrons. These
particles have mass, an inherent property
of particles. Similarly, the electric charge
is another intrinsic and fundamental
property of particles. The nature of charges
is understood through various experiments
performed in the 19th and 20th century. The
SI unit of charge is coulomb.

**(ii) Conservation of charges**

Benjamin Franklin argued that when one
object is rubbed with another object, charges
get transferred from one to the other. Before
rubbing, both objects are electrically neutral
and rubbing simply transfers the charges
from one object to the other. (For example,
when a glass rod is rubbed against silk cloth,
some negative charge are transferred from
glass to silk. As a result, the glass rod is
positively charged and silk cloth becomes
negatively charged).


From these observations, he concluded
that charges are neither created or nor
destroyed but can only be transferred
from one object to other. This is called
conservation of total charges and is one of the
fundamental conservation laws in physics. It
is stated more generally in the following way.


**The total electric charge in the universe**
**is constant and charge can neither be created nor be destroyed. In any physical process, the net change in charge will**
**always be zero.**

**(iii) Quantisation of charges**

What is the smallest amount of charge
that can be found in nature? Experiments
show that the charge on an electron is −e
and the charge on the proton is +e. Here, e
denotes the fundamental unit of charge. The
charge q on any object is equal to an integral
multiple of this fundamental unit of charge e.

q = ne                                (1.1)

Here n is any integer (0, ±1, ±2, ±3,
±4...........). This is called quantisation of
electric charge.

Robert Millikan in his famous experiment
found that the value of e = 1.6 × 10<sup>–19</sup> C. The
charge of an electron is −1.6 × 10<sup>–19</sup> C and
the charge of the proton is +1.6 × 10<sup>–19</sup> C.
When a glass rod is rubbed with silk cloth,
the number of charges transferred is usually
very large, typically of the order of 1010. So
the charge quantisation is not appreciable
at the macroscopic level. Hence the charges
are treated to be continuous (not discrete).
But at the microscopic level, quantisation of
charge plays a vital role.


### EXAMPLE 1.1

According to the quantisation of charge,

**q = ne**     ----------(1.1)

Here q = 1C. So the number of electrons in
1 coulomb of charge is

\\( n = \dfrac{q}{e}= \dfrac{IC}{1.6 * 10^-19}\\) =  \\(6.25 * 10^{18} electrons\\).


### <u>  1.2 COULOMB’S LAW </u>

n the year 1786, Coulomb deduced
the expression for the force between two
stationary point charges in vacuum or
free space. Consider two point charges q1
and q2 at rest in vacuum, and separated
by a distance of r as shown in Figure 1.2.
According to Coulomb, the force on the
point charge q<sub>2</sub> exerted by another point
charge q<sub>1</sub> is

![Figure 1.2 Coulomb force between two positive point charges](/books/12-physics/unit1/pic2.png)

**Important aspects of Coulomb’s law**

(i) Coulomb's law states that the electrostatic
force is directly proportional to the product of
the magnitude of the two point charges and
is inversely proportional to the square of the
distance between the two point charges.

(ii) The force on the charge q<sub>2</sub> exerted
by the charge q<sub>1 always lies along the line
joining the two charges. 
\\( \hat{r}_ {12}\\) is the unit vector
pointing from charge q<sub>1</sub> to q<sub>2</sub> .It is shown
in the Figure 1.2. Likewise, the force on the
charge q<sub>1</sub> exerted by q<sub>2</sub> is along -\\( \hat{r}_ {12}\\)(i.e., in
the direction opposite to \\( \hat{r}_ {12}\\)
.

(iii)  In SI units, \\(\ k = \dfrac{1}{4\pi\in_0}\\) and its value is \\(\ 9 * 10^9 N m^2 C^-2\\). Here \\(\in_0\\) is the permittivity of free
space or vacuum and its value is 

\\(\ \in_0 = \dfrac{1}{4\pi k} = 8.85 * 10^{-12}C^{2}N^{-1}m{-2}\\).

(iv) The magnitude of the electrostatic
force between two charges each of one
coulomb and separated by a distance of 1 m
is calculated as follows:


\\(|F| = \dfrac{9*10^9 *1 *1}{1^2} = 9 * 10^9 N\\)

This is a huge quantity, almost equivalent
to the weight of one million ton. We
never come across 1 coulomb of charge in
practice. Most of the electrical phenomena
in day-to-day life involve electrical charges
of the order of µC (micro coulomb) or nC
(nano coulomb).


(v) In SI units, Coulomb’s law in vacuum
takes the form \\(\ vec{F_21}\\) = \\(\dfrac{1}{4\pi\in_0} \dfrac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\hat{r}_ {12}\\).
In a medium of permittivity \\(\isin_0\\), the force between two point charges is given by 
\\(\vec{F_21}\\) = \\(\dfrac{1}{4\pi\in_0} \dfrac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\hat{r}_ {12}\\).

Since \\(\isin \ge \isin_0\\), the force between two point
charges in a medium other than vacuum is
always less than that in vacuum. We define
the relative permittivity for a given medium
\\(\isin_r = \dfrac{\isin}{\isin_0}.\\) 
For vacuum or air, \\(\isin_r = 1\\)  and for
all other media \\(\isin_r \ge 1\\).

**(vi)** Coulomb’s law has same structure
as Newton’s law of gravitation. Both are
inversely proportional to the square of
the distance between the particles. The
electrostatic force is directly proportional
to the product of the magnitude of
two point charges and gravitational force
is directly proportional to the product
of two masses. But there are some
important differences between these two
laws.


* The gravitational force between two
masses is always attractive but Coulomb
force between two charges can be attractive
or repulsive, depending on the nature of
charges.

* The gravitational force between two
masses is independent of the medium. For
example, if 1 kg of two masses are kept in
air or inside water, the gravitational force
between two masses remains the same.
But the electrostatic force between the two
charges depends on nature of the medium
in which the two charges are kept at rest.

**(vii)** The force on a charge q<sub>1</sub> exerted by a
point charge q<sub>2</sub>is given by




\\(\vec{} \\) = \\(\dfrac{1}{4\pi\in_0} \dfrac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\hat{r}_ {12}\\)



The value of the gravitational constant
\\(G  = 6.67 × 10^{-11} N m2 kg^{-2}\\). The value
of the constant k in Coulomb law is
k = 9 × 109 N m2 C–2. Since k is much
more greater than G, the electrostatic
force is always greater in magnitude than
gravitational force for smaller size objects.

\\(\vec{F_21}\\) = \\(\dfrac{1}{4\pi\in_0} \dfrac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\hat{r}_ {12}\\).

Here \\( \hat{r}_ {12}\\)  is the unit vector from charge q<sub>2</sub> to q<sub>1</sub>.

But \\(\hat{r_21} =   \hat{r_12}\\).

\\(\vec{F_{12}}\\) = \\(\dfrac{1}{4\pi\in_0} \dfrac{q_1q_2}{r^2}(-\hat{r}_ {12})\\).

Therefore, the electrostatic force obeys
Newton’s third law.

(viii) The expression for Coulomb force
is true only for point charges. But the point
charge is an ideal concept. However we
can apply Coulomb’s law for two charged
objects whose sizes are very much smaller
than the distance between them. In fact,
Coulomb discovered his law by considering
the charged spheres in the torsion balance
as point charges. The distance between the
two charged spheres is much greater than the
radii of the spheres.

### EXAMPLE 1.2 

Consider two point charges q1 and q2 at rest as shown in the figure.

![](/books/12-physics/unit1/pic3.png)

![](/books/12-physics/unit1/pic4.png)

According to Newton’s third law, the force
experienced by the charge q<sub></sub>1 due to q<sub>2</sub> is

\\(\vec{F_{12}}\\) = -\\(\vec{F_{21}}\\). Therefore


\\(\vec{F_{12}}\\)  = -54 * 10^{-3}\hat{i} N.\\)

The directions of \\(\vec{F_{21}}\\)  and \\(\vec{F_{12}}\\) are shown in the above figure in case (a)

The directions of F<sub>21</sub> and F<sub>12</sub> are shown in
the above figure in case (a) 

(b) q<sub>1</sub> = +2 μC, q<sub>2</sub> = –3 μC, and r = 1m.
They are unlike charges. So the force will
be attractive.

Force experienced by the charge  q<sub>2</sub> due to q<sub>1</sub> iss given by

\\(\vec{F_{12}}\\)  = \\(\dfrac{9*10^9(2*10^{-6})*(-3*10^{-6})}{1^2}\\)  \\( \hat{r}_ {12}\\)
