### 4.1 ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION

#### 4.1.1 Introduction

In the previous chapter, we have learnt
that whenever an electric current flows
through a conductor, it produces a magnetic
field around it. This was discovered by
Christian Oersted. Later, Ampere proved
that a current-carrying loop behaves like a
bar magnet. These are the magnetic effects
produced by the electric current.

Physicists then began to think of the
converse effect. Is it possible to produce an
electric current with the help of a magnetic
field? A series of experiments were
conducted to establish the converse effect.
These experiments were done by Michael
Faraday of UK and Joseph Henry of USA,
almost simultaneously and independently.
These attempts became successful and
led to the discovery of the phenomenon,
called Electromagnetic Induction. Michael
Faraday is credited with the discovery of
electromagnetic induction in 1831. 

In this chapter, let us see a few
experiments of Faraday, the results and the
phenomenon of Electromagnetic Induction.
Before that, we will recollect the concept of
magnetic flux linked with a surface area.

{{<box title = "An anecdote!">}}

Michael Faraday was enormously
popular for his lectures as well. In
one of his lectures, he demonstrated
his experiments which led to
the discovery of electromagnetic
induction.

At the end of the lecture, one
member of the audience approached
Faraday and said, “Mr. Faraday, the
behaviour of the magnet and the coil
of wire was interesting, but what is the
use of it?”  Faraday answered politely,
“Sir, what is the use of a newborn
baby?”

**Note**: We will soon see the greatness
of ‘that little child’ who has now
grown as an adult to cater to the
energy needs.

#### 4.1.2 Magnetic Flux (\\(\Phi_B\\))

The magnetic flux \\(\Phi_B\\) through an area A
in a magnetic field is defined as the number
of magnetic field lines passing through that
area normally and is given by the equation
(Figure 4.1(a)).

\\(\Phi_B = \int_A \overrightharpoon{B}.\overrightharpoon{dA}\\)


where the integral is taken over the area
A and θ is the angle between the direction of
the magnetic field and the outward normal
to the area. 

**figure 4.1**

If the magnetic field \overrightharpoon{B}
 is uniform over
the area A and is perpendicular to the area
as shown in Figure 4.1(b), then the above
equation becomes 

\\(\Phi_B = \int_A \overrightharpoon{B}.\overrightharpoon{dA} = BA cos \theta \\)


\\(=BA since \theta = 0° , cos0° = 1 \\)

The SI unit of magnetic flux is \\(T m^2\\)
. It is also measured in weber or \\(Wb\\).

\\(1 Wb = 1 T m^2\\)

### EXAMPLE 4.1

A circular antenna of area \\(3 m^2\\)
 is installed
at a place in Madurai. The plane of the
area of antenna is inclined at  \\(47°\\)
 with the
direction of Earth’s magnetic field. If the
magnitude of Earth’s field at that place is
\\(4.1 × 10^{–5} T\\) find the magnetic flux linked
with the antenna.

**Solution**

\\(B = 4.1 × 10^{–5} T; \theta = 90° – 47° = 43°;\\) 

\\(A = 3m^2\\)

\\(We know that \phi_B = BA cos \theta \\)

\\(\phi_B = 4.1 × 10^{–5} × 3 × cos 43°\\)

\\(= 4.1 × 10^{–5} × 3 × 0.7314\\)

\\(= 89.96 \mu Wb\\)

### EXAMPLE 4.2

A circular loop of area \\(5 \times 10^{–2} m^2\\)
 rotates
in a uniform magnetic field of \\(0.2 T.\\)
If the loop rotates about its diameter which
is perpendicular to the magnetic field as
shown in figure. Find the magnetic flux
linked with the loop when its plane is
(i) normal to the field (ii) inclined 60o
 to
the field and (iii) parallel to the field.


**figure**

**Solution**

\\(A = 5 \times 10^{–2} m^2; B = 0.2 T\\)

\\((i) θ = 0°;\\)

\\(\phi_B = BA cos \theta = 0.2 \times 5 \times 10^{-2} 0°\\)

\\(\phi_B = 1 \times 10^{-3} Wb\\)

\\((ii) θ = 90° – 60° = 30° ;\\)
