### 7.1 Introduction

The term 'Thermodynamics' means
flow of heat and is derived from the Greek
`Thermos' (heat) and `dynamics' (flow),
In our daily life, we come across many
useful reactions such as burning of fuel
to produce heat energy, flow of electrons
through circuit to produce electrical
energy, metabolic reactions to produce the
necessary energy for biological functions
and so on. Thermodynamics, the study of
the transformation of energy, explains all
such processes quantitatively and allows
us to make useful predictions.

In the 19th century, scientists tried
to understand the underlying principles
of steam engine which were already
in operation, in order to improve their
efficiency. The basic problem of the
investigation was the transformation of
heat into mechanical work. However,
over time, the laws of thermodynamics
were developed and helped to understand
the process of steam engine. These laws
have been used to deduce powerful
mathematical relationships applicable to a
broad range of processes.
Thermodynamics evaluates the
macroscopic properties (heat, work) and
their inter relationships. It deals with
properties of systems in equilibrium
and is independent of any theories or
properties of the individual molecules
which constitute the system.

The principles of thermodynamics
are based on three laws of thermodynamics.
The first two laws (First and second law)
summarise the actual experience of inter
conversion of different forms of energy.
The third law deals with the calculation
of entropy and the unattainability of
absolute zero Kelvin. Thermodynamics
carries high practical values but bears
certain limitations. It is independent
of atomic and molecular structure and
reaction mechanism. The laws can be
used to predict whether a particular
reaction is feasible or not under a given
set of conditions, but they cannot give the
rate at which the reaction takes place. In
other words, thermodynamics deals with
equilibrium conditions quantitatively,
but does not take into account the kinetic
approach to the equilibrium state.

### 7.2 System and Surrounding

Before studying the laws of
thermodynamics and their applications,
it is important to understand the meaning
of a few terms used frequently in
thermodynamics.

The universe is divided into two
parts, the system and its surroundings.
The system is the part of universe which
is under thermodynamic consideration. It
is separated from the rest of the universe
by real or imaginary boundaries.

![Figure 7.1 System, surrounding & boundary Homogeneous and
heterogeneous systems](/books/chemistry/part-1/thermodynamics/pic1.png)

**Example:**

The system may be water in a
beaker, a balloon filled with air, an aqueous
solution of glucose etc.

On the basis of physical and
chemical properties, systems can be
divided into two types.

A system is called homogeneous
if the physical state of all its constituents
are the same. Example: a mixture of gases,
completely miscible mixture of liquids etc.

A system is called heterogeneous, if
physical state of all its constituents is not
the same.
Example: mixture of oil and water

**Surrounding:**

Everything in the universe that
is not the part of the system is called
surroundings.

**Boundary:**
Anything which separates the
system from its surrounding is called
boundary.

**7.2.1 Types of systems:**

There are three types of
thermodynamic systems depending on
the nature of the boundary.

![Figure 7.2Types of Systems](/books/chemistry/part-1/thermodynamics/pic2.png)

**Isolated system:**


A system which can exchange
neither matter nor energy with its
surroundings is called an isolated system.
Here boundary is sealed and insulated.
Hot water contained in a thermos flask, is
an example for an isolated system. In this
isolated system both energy (heat) and
matter (water vapour) neither enter nor
leave the system.

**Closed system:**

A system which can exchange
only energy but not matter with its
surroundings is called a closed system.
Here the boundary is sealed but not
insulated. Hot water contained in a closed
beaker is an example for a closed system.
In this system energy (heat) is transferred
to the surroundings but no matter (water
vapour) can escape from this system. A
gas contained in a cylinder fitted with a
piston constitutes a closed system.

**Open system:**

A System which can exchange both
matter and energy with its surrounding is
called an open system. Hot water contained
in an open beaker is an example for open
system. In this system both matter (water
vapour) and energy (heat) is transferred
to the surrounding.
All living things and chemical
reactions are open systems because they
exchange matter and energy with the
surroundings.

### 7.2.2 Properties of the system:

**Intensive and extensive properties**

Some of the properties of a system
depend on its mass or size whereas other
properties do not depend on its mass or
size. Based on this, the properties of a
system are grouped as **extensive** property
and **intensive**property.

**Extensive properties:**

The property that depends on the mass or
the size of the system is called an extensive
property.

**Examples:** Volume, Number of moles,
Mass, Internal energy, etc.,

**Intensive properties:**

The property that is independent of the
mass or the size of the system is called an
intensive property.

**Examples :**Refractive index, Surface
tension, density, temperature, Boiling
point, Freezing point, molar volume, etc.,

### 7.2.3 Thermodynamic processes

The method of operation which
can bring about a change in the system is
called thermodynamic process. Heating,
cooling, expansion, compression, fusion,
vaporization etc., are some examples of a
thermodynamic process.

**Types of processes:**

A thermodynamic process can be
carried out in different ways and under
different conditions. The processes can be
classified as follows:

**Reversible process:**

The process in which the system
and surrounding can be restored to
the initial state from the final state
without producing any changes in the
thermodynamic properties of the universe
is called a reversible process. There are two
important conditions for the reversible
process to occur. Firstly, the process should
occur infinitesimally slowly and secondly
throughout the process, the system and
surroundings must be in equilibrium with
each other.

**Irreversible Process:**

The process in which the system
and surrounding cannot be restored to the
initial state from the final state is called
an irreversible process. All the processes
occurring in nature are irreversible
processes. During the irreversible process
the system and surroundings are not in
equilibrium with each other.

**Adiabatic process:**

An adiabatic process is defined as
one in which there is no exchange of heat
(q) between the system and surrounding
during the process. Those processes in
which no heat can flow into or out of the
system are called **<i>adiabatic processes**</i>.
This condition is attained by thermally
insulating the system. In an adiabatic
process if work is done by the system its
temperature decreases, if work is done
on the system its temperature increases,
because, the system cannot exchange heat
with its surroundings.


For an adiabatic process q = 0

**Isothermal process :**

An isothermal process is defined as
one in which the temperature of the system
remains constant, during the change
from its initial to final state. The system
exchanges heat with its surrounding and
the temperature of the system remains
constant. For this purpose the experiment
is often performed in a thermostat.
For an isothermal process dT = 0

**Isobaric process**
An isobaric process is defined as
one in which the pressure of the system
remains constant during its change from
the initial to final state.

For an isobaric process dP= 0 .

**Isochoric process**

An isochoric process is defined as
the one in which the volume of system
remains constant during its change from
initial to final state. Combustion of a fuel
in a bomb calorimeter is an example of an
isochoric process.

For an isochoric process, dV= 0.

**Cyclic process:**

When a system returns to its
original state after completing a series
of changes, then it is said that a cycle is
completed. This process is known as a
cyclic process.

For a cyclic process dU = 0, dH = 0, dP=0, dV=0, dT=0

**State functions, path functions:**

**State function**

A thermodynamic system can be defined
by using the variables P, V, T and `n'. A state
function is a thermodynamic property of
a system, which has a specific value for a
given state and does not depend on the
path (or manner) by which the particular
state is reached.

Example : Pressure (P), Volume (V),
Temperature(T), Internal energy (U),
Enthalpy (H), free energy (G) etc.

**Path functions:**

A path function is a thermodynamic
property of the system whose value
depends on the path by which the system
changes from its initial to final states.

**Example: Work (w), Heat (q).**

Work (w) will have different values
if the process is carried out reversibly or
irreversibly.


**Internal Energy (U)**

The internal energy is a
characteristic property of a system which
is denoted by the symbol U. The internal
energy of a system is equal to the energy
possessed by all its constituents namely
atoms, ions and molecules. The total
energy of all molecules in a system is equal
to the sum of their translational energy
(U<sub>t</sub>), vibrational energy (U<sub>v</sub>), rotational
energy (U<sub>r</sub>), bond energy (U<sub>b</sub>), electronic
energy (U<sub>e</sub>) and energy due to molecular
interactions (U<sub>i</sub>).

Thus:
U = U<sub>t</sub> + U<sub>v</sub> + U<sub>r</sub>+U<sub>b</sub> +U<sub>e</sub> + U<sub>i</sub>

The total energy of all the molecules of
the system is called internal energy. In
thermodynamics one is concerned only
with the change in internal energy (ΔU)
rather than the absolute value of energy.


**Importance of Internal energy**

The internal energy possessed by
a substance differentiates its physical
structure. For example, the allotropes of
carbon, namely, graphite (C<sub>graphite</sub>) and
diamond (C<sub>diamond</sub>), differ from each other
because they possess different internal
energies and have different structures.

**Characteristics of internal energy (U):**

* The internal energy of a system is an
extensive property. It depends on the
amount of the substances present in
the system. If the amount is doubled,
the internal energy is also doubled.

* The internal energy of a system is a
state function. It depends only upon
the state variables (T, P, V, n) of the
system. The change in internal energy
does not depend on the path by which
the final state is reached.

* The change in internal energy of a
system is expressed as ΔU= U<sub>f</sub> – U<sub>i</sub>

* In a cyclic process, there is no internal
energy change. ΔU(cyclic) = 0

* If the internal energy of the system
in the final state (U<sub>f</sub>) is less than the
internal energy of the system in its
initial state (U<sub>i</sub>), then ΔU would be
negative.

ΔU=U<sub>f</sub> – U<sub>i</sub>= −ve (U<sub>f</sub> < U<sub>f</sub>)


• If the internal energy of the system
in the final state (U<sub>f</sub>) is greater than
the internal energy of the system in
its initial state (U<sub>i</sub>), then ΔU would be
positive.

ΔU=U<sub>f</sub> − U<sub>i</sub>= +ve (U<sub>f</sub>) > U<sub>i</sub>

The heat (q) is regarded as an energy
in transit across the boundary separating
a system from its surrounding. Heat
changes lead to temperature differences
between system and surrounding. Heat is
a path function.

**Units of heat:**

The SI unit of heat is joule (J).
Heat quantities are generally measured
in calories (cal). A calorie is defined as
the quantity of heat required to raise the
temperature of 1 gram of water by 1° C in
the vicinity of 15° C.

**Sign convention of heat:**

The symbol of heat is q.

If heat flows into the system from
the surrounding, energy of a system
increases. Hence it is taken to be positive
(+q).

If heat flows out of the system into
the surrounding, energy of the system
decreases. Hence, it is taken to be negative
(–q).

**Work(w)**

Work is defined as the force (F) multiplied
by the displacement(x).

−w = F. x –––––––––––(7.1)

The negative sign (−) is introduced
to indicate that the work has been done
by the system by spending a part of its
internal energy.

The work,

(i) is a path function.

(ii) appears only at the boundary of the
system.

(iii) appears during the change in the state
of the system.

(iv) In thermodynamics, surroundings is
so large that macroscopic changes to
surroundings do not happen.

**Units of work:**

The SI unit of work is joule (J),
which is defined as the work done
by a force of one Newton through a
displacement of one meter ( J= Nm). We
often use kilojoule (kJ) for large quantities
of work. 1 kJ = 1000 J.

**Sign convention of work:**

The symbol of work is 'w'.

If work is done by the system, the
energy of the system decreases, hence by
convention, work is taken to be negative
(− w).

If work is done on the system, the
energy of the system increases, hence
by convention, the work is taken to be
positive (+w).

**Pressure - volume work**

In elementary thermodynamics the
only type of work generally considered
is the work done in expansion (or
compression) of a gas. This is known
as pressure-volume work, PV work or
expansion work.

**Work involved in expansion and compression processes:**

In most thermodynamic
calculations we are dealing with the
evaluation of work involved in the
expansion or compression of gases.
The essential condition for expansion
or compression of a system is that there
should be difference between external
pressure (P<sub>ext</sub>) and internal pressure (P<sub>int</sub>).

For understanding pressure-
volume work, let us consider a cylinder
which contains 'n' moles of an ideal gas
fitted with a frictionless piston of cross
sectional area A. The total volume of the
gas inside is V<sub>i</sub> and pressure of the gas
inside is P<sub>int</sub>.


If the external pressure P<sub>ext</sub> is
greater than P<sub>int</sub>, the piston moves inward
till the pressure inside becomes equal to
Pext. Let this change be achieved in a single
step and the final volume be V<sub>f</sub>.

In this case, the work is done on the system
(+w). It can be calculated as follows

w = –F .Δx ------------ (7.2)

where dx is the distance moved by
the piston during the compression and F
is the force acting on the gas.



![Figure 7.3 showing work involved in
compression processes] (/books/chemistry/part-1/thermodynamics/pic3.png)

F = P<sub>ext</sub> A---- (7.3)

             Substituting 7.3 in 7.2

w = – P<sub>ext</sub> . A. Δx    

A.Δx = change in volume = V<sub>f</sub>-V<sub>i</sub>

w = – P<sub>ext</sub> . (V<sub>f</sub>-V<sub>i</sub>) -––––– (7.4)


 w = –P<sub>ext</sub> . (–ΔV) –––––– (7.5)

= P<sub>ext</sub> . ΔV

Since work is done on the system, it
is a positive quantity.
If the pressure is not constant, but
changes during the process such that it
is always infinitesimally greater than the
pressure of the gas, then, at each stage of
compression, the volume decreases by an
infinitesimal amount, dV. In such a case
we can calculate the work done on the gas
by the relation

In a compression process, Pext the
external pressure is always greater than
the pressure of the system.

i.e P<sub>ext</sub> = (P<sub>int</sub> + dP).

In an expansion process, the
external pressure is always less than the
pressure of the system

i.e. P<sub>ext</sub> = (P<sub>int</sub> - dP).

![Figure 7.4](/books/chemistry/part-1/thermodynamics/pic4.png)

When pressure is not constant and changes
in infinitesimally small steps (reversible
conditions) during compression from V<sub>i</sub>
to V<sub>f</sub>
, the P-V plot looks like in fig 7.4
Work done on the gas is represented by
the shaded area.

In general case we can write,

P<sub>ext</sub> = (P<sub>int</sub> + dP). Such processes
are called reversible processes. For a
compression process work can be related
to internal pressure of the system under
reversible conditions by writing equation

For a given system with an ideal gas

P<sub>int</sub> V = <sub>n</sub>RT

P<sub>int</sub> = <sub>n</sub>RT/V

If V<sub>f</sub> > V<sub>i</sub> (expansion), the sign of work
done by the process is negative.

If V<sub>f</sub> < V <sub>i</sub>
(compression) the sign of work
done on the process is positive.

**7.3 Zeroth law of thermodynamics:**

The zeroth law of thermodynamics,
also known as the law of thermal
equilibrium, was put forward much after
the establishment of the first and second
laws of thermodynamics. It is placed
before the first and second laws as it
provides a logical basis for the concept of
temperature of the system.

![Figure : 7.5 Zeroth law of thermodynamics:](/books/chemistry/part-1/thermodynamics/pic5.png)


The law states that `If two systems
are separately in thermal equilibrium with
a third one, then they tend to be in thermal
equilibrium with themselves'.


According to this law, if systems
B and C separately are in thermal
equilibrium with another system A, then
systems B and C will also be in thermal
equilibrium with each other. This is also
the principle by which thermometers are
used.

**7.4 First Law of Thermodynamics:**

The first law of thermodynamics,
known as the law of conservation of
energy, states that the total energy of an
isolated system remains constant though
it may change from one form to another.

When a system moves from state 1
to state 2, its internal energy changes from
U<sub>1</sub> to U<sub>2</sub>. Then change in internal energy


ΔU = U<sub>2</sub> – U<sub>1</sub>.

This internal energy change is
brought about by the either absorption
or evolution of heat and/or by work being
done by/on the system.

Because the total energy of the
system must remain constant, we can
write the mathematical statement of the
First Law as:

ΔU = q + w –––––––––––––––––(7.7)

Where q - the amount of heat supplied to
the system; w - work done on the system
Other statements of first law of
thermodynamics

(1) Whenever an energy of a particular type
disappears, an equivalent amount of
another type must be produced.


(2) The total energy of a system and
surrounding remains constant (or
conserved)


(3) "Energy can neither be created nor
destroyed, but may be converted from
one form to another".


(4) "The change in the internal energy of
a closed system is equal to the energy
that passes through its boundary as
heat or work".


(5) "Heat and work are two ways of
changing a system's internal energy".

### 7.4.1 Mathematical statement of the first law

The mathematical statement of the first
law of thermodynamics is

ΔU = q + w --------- (7.7)

Case 1 : For a cyclic process
involving isothermal expansion of an
ideal gas,

ΔU = 0.

eqn (7.7) ⇒∴ q = -w

In other words, during a cyclic
process, the amount of heat absorbed by
the system is equal to work done by the
system.


Case 2 : For an isochoric process
(no change in volume) there is no work of
expansion. i.e. ΔV = 0


ΔU = q + w

   = q - PΔV

ΔV = 0

ΔU = q<sub>v</sub>

In other words, during an isochoric
process, the amount of heat supplied to the
system is converted to its internal energy.


Case 3 : For an adiabatic process
there is no change in heat. i.e. q= 0. Hence

q = 0
eqn (7.7) ⇒ ΔU = w

In other words, in an adiabatic
process, the decrease in internal energy
is exactly equal to the work done by the
system on its surroundings.


Case 4 : For an isobaric process.
There is no change in the pressure. P
remains constant. Hence

ΔU = q + w

ΔU = q - P ΔV

In other words, in an isobaric
process a part of heat absorbed by the
system is used for P-V expansion work
and the remaining is added to the internal
energy of the system.

**Problem: 7.1**

A gas contained in a cylinder fitted
with a frictionless piston expands against
a constant external pressure of 1 atm from
a volume of 5 litres to a volume of 10 litres.
In doing so it absorbs 400 J of thermal
energy from its surroundings. Determine
the change in internal energy of system.

**Solution:**

Given data q = 400 J V<sub>1</sub>=5L V2 = 10L

Δu = q-w (heat is given to
the system (+q); work is done by the
system(-w)
Δu = q - PdV

   = 400 J - 1 atm (10-5)L

   = 400 J - 5 atm L

[∴1L atm = 101.33 J]

         = 400 J - 5 × 101.33 J

         = 400 J - 506.65 J

         = - 106.65 J

**7.5 Enthalpy (H)**


The enthalpy (H), is a
thermodynamic property of a system, is
defined as the sum of the internal energy
(U) of a system and the product of pressure
and volume of the system. That is,

H = U + PV –––––––––––––––––(7.8)

It reflects the capacity to do
mechanical work and the capacity to
release heat by the system. When a process
occurs at constant pressure, the heat
involved (either released or absorbed) is
equal to the change in enthalpy.
Enthalpy is a state function which
depends entirely on the state functions T,
P and U. Enthalpy is usually expressed as
the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for a process
between initial and final states at constant
pressure.

ΔH = ΔU + PΔV ––––––––––––––––(7.9)

The change in enthalpy (ΔH) is
equal to the heat supplied at the constant
pressure to a system (as long as the system
does no additional work).

ΔH=q<sub>q</sub>

In an endothermic reaction heat
is absorbed by the system from the
surroundings that is q>0 (positive).
Therefore, ΔH is also positive. In an
exothermic reaction heat is evolved by the
system to the surroundings that is, q<0
(negative). If q is negative, then ΔH will
also be negative.


**7.5.1 Relation between enthalpy `H' and internal energy U'**

When the system at constant
pressure undergoes changes from an
initial state with H<sub>1</sub>, U<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>1</sub> to a final
state with H<sub>2</sub>, U<sub>2</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> the change in
enthalpy ΔH, can be calculated as follows:

H = U + PV 

In the initial state

H<sub>1</sub> = U<sub>1</sub> + PV<sub>1</sub>−−−−−(7.10)

In the final state

H<sub>2</sub> = U<sub>2</sub> + PV<sub>2</sub>    −−−−(7.11)

change in enthalpy is (7.11) - (7.10)

(H<sub>2</sub>−H<sub>1</sub>) = (U<sub>2</sub>−U<sub>1</sub>) + P(V<sub>2</sub>−V<sub>1</sub>)


ΔH=ΔU + PΔV --------- (7.12)

As per first law of thermodynamics,

ΔU = q+w

Equation 7.12 becomes

ΔH = q + w + PΔV

w= -PΔV

ΔH = q<sub>p</sub> - PΔV + PΔV

ΔH = q<sub>p</sub>–––––––––– (7.13)

q<sub>p</sub> − is the heat absorbed at constant
pressure and is considered as heat content.
Consider a closed system of gases
which are chemically reacting to form
gaseous products at constant temperature

as the number of moles of gaseous reactants and products,
then,

For reactants (initial state) :

For products (final state) :

### <ins>7.5.2 Enthalpy Changes for Different Types of Reactions and Phase Transitions:</ins>


The heat or enthalpy changes
accompanying chemical reactions is
expressed in different ways depending
on the nature of the reaction. These are
discussed below.

Standard heat of formation
The standard heat of formation of
a compound is defined as “the change in
enthalpy that takes place when one mole of
a compound is formed from its elements,
present in their standard states (298 K
and 1 bar pressure)". By convention the
standard heat of formation of all elements
is assigned a value of zero.


Fe(s)+ S(s) → FeS(s)

ΔH<sub>f</sub>0 = – 100.42 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

2C(s)+H<sub>2</sub>(g)→ C<sub>2</sub>H2<sub>(g)</sub>

ΔH<sub>f</sub> <sup>0</sup>= + 222.33 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

1/2 Cl<sub>2</sub>(g) + 1/2H<sub>2</sub>(g) --> HCl(g)

ΔH<sub>f</sub> 0 = – 92.4 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

The standard heats of formation of
some compounds are given in Table 7.4.

**<ins>Table: 7.4 standard heat of formation of some compunds</ins>**

| **substance**     | **ΔHf<sub>0</sub>(k)mol<sup>-1</sup>** | **substance**                 | **ΔHf<sub>0</sub>(k)mol<sup>-1</sup>** |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| H2<sub>o</sub>(l) | −242                                   | CH<sub>4</sub>(g)             | -74.85                                 |
| HCl(g)            | −92.4                                  | C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>(g) | −84.6                                  |
| HBr(g)            | −36.4                                  | C<sub>6</sub>H<sub></sub>(g)  | +49.6                                  |

| CO2(g)            | -393.5                                 | CH<sub>3</sub>OH
(l)           | −239.2 
                                               |

**<ins>7.6 Thermochemical Equations:**</ins>


A thermochemical equation is
a balanced stoichiometric chemical
equation that includes the enthalpy
change (ΔH). The following conventions
are adopted in thermochemical equations:

(i) The coefficients in a balanced
thermochemical equation refer to
number of moles of reactants and
products involved in the reaction.

(ii) The enthalpy change of the reaction
ΔHr has to be specified with
appropriate sign and unit.

(iii) When the chemical reaction is
reversed, the value of ΔH is reversed
in sign with the same magnitude.

(iv) The physical states (gas, liquid,
aqueous, solid in brackets) of all
species are important and must
be specified in a thermochemical
reaction, since ΔH depends on
the physical state of reactants and
products.

(v) If the thermochemical equation is
multiplied throughout by a number,
the enthalpy change is also multiplied
by the same number.

(vi) The negative sign of ΔHr

indicates
that the reaction is exothermic and
the positive sign of ΔHr
indicates an endothermic reaction.

For example, consider the following
reaction,

2 H<sub>2</sub>(g)+O<sub>2</sub>(g)→2 H<sub>2</sub>O(g)

  ΔH<sub>r</sub>0 =− 967.4 kJ

  2 H<sub>2</sub> O (g) → 2 H<sub>2</sub>(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g)

  ΔH<sub>r</sub>0 = + 967.4 kJ

  Standard enthalpy of reaction (ΔH<sub>r</sub><sup>o</sup>) from standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) <sup>o</sup>

  The standard enthalpy of a reaction
is the enthalpy change for a reactionwhen all the reactants and products are
present in their standard states. Standard
conditions are denoted by adding the
superscript 0 to the symbol (ΔH<sup>o</sup>)

We can calculate the enthalpy of
a reaction under standard conditions
from the values of standard enthalpies
of formation of various reactants and
products. The standard enthalpy of
reaction is equal to the difference between
standard enthalpy of formation of products
and the standard enthalpies of formation
of reactants.

ΔHr<sup>0</sup>= Σ ΔHr<sup>0</sup><sub>(products)</sub>

For a general reaction

aA + bB → cC +dD

ΔHf<sup>0</sup> = Σ ΔHr<sup>0</sup><sub>(products) -  Σ ΔHr<sup>0</sup><sub>(reactants)

ΔHf<sup>0</sup> = { c ΔHf<sup>0</sup>(C) + d ΔHf<sup>0</sup>(D)} –
 {a ΔHf<sup>0</sup>(A) + b ΔHf<sup>0</sup>(B)}

 **<ins>Problem : 7.2</ins>**

 The standard enthalpies of formation of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH(l),CO<sub>2</sub>(g)CO<sub>2</sub>(g) are - 277,-393.5 and -285.5 kJ mol-1 respectively.

Calculate the standard enthalpy change
for the reaction

C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH(l)+3O<sub>2</sub>(g)→2CO<sub>2</sub>(g)+3 H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

The enthalpy of formation of O<sub>2</sub>(g) in the
standard state is Zero, by definition

**<ins>Solution:</ins>**

For example, the standard enthalpy
change for the combustion of ethanol can
be calculated from the standard enthalpies
of formation of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH(l), CO<sub>2</sub>(g)
and H<sub>2</sub>O(l). The enthalpies of formation
are –277, – 393.5 and –285.5 kJ mol–1
respectively.

C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH(l) + 3O<sub>2</sub>(g) → 2CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + 3H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

∆H<sub>r</sub><sup>0</sup>  = {(∆H<sub>r</sub><sup>0</sup><sub>products</sub>)  - 
(∆H<sub>r</sub><sup>0</sup><sub>rectants</sub>) }

∆H<sub>r</sub><sup>0</sup> = -1366.5 J


{{< box title="Evaluate Yourself - 1" type="objective" >}} 

Calculate ∆H<sub>r</sub><sup>0</sup> for the reaction

CO<sub>2</sub>(g)+ H<sub>2</sub>(g) → CO(g)+ H<sub>2</sub>O(g)

given that ∆H<sub>r</sub><sup>0</sup>  for  CO<sub>2</sub>(g), CO(g) and
H<sub>2</sub>O(g) are – 393.5, – 111.31 and – 242
kJ mol–1 respectively.

{{< /box >}}

**<ins>Heat of combustion</ins>**

The heat of combustion of a
substance is defined as “The change in
enthalpy of a system when one mole of the
substance is completely burnt in excess
of air or oxygen”. It is denoted by ΔH<sub>C</sub>.
For example, the heat of combustion of
methane is – 87.78 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>.

CH<sub>4</sub>(g)+ 2O<sub>2</sub>(g)→ CO<sub>2</sub>(g)+ 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

ΔHC = – 87.78 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

For the combustion of carbon,

C (s)+ O<sub>2</sub>(g) → CO<sub>2</sub>(g)

ΔHC = – 394.55 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

Combustion reactions are always
exothermic. Hence the enthalpy change is
always negative.

**<ins>Molar heat capacities</ins>**

When heat (q) is supplied to a system, the
molecules in the system absorb the heat
and hence their kinetic energy increases,
which in turn raises the temperature of the
system from T<sub>1</sub> to T<sub>2</sub>. This increase (T2 - T1)
in temperature is directly proportional to
the amount of heat absorbed and inversely
proportional to mass of the substance. In
other words,

q α mΔT

q = c m ΔT

c = q/m ΔT

The constant c is called heat
capacity.

<!-- Equation coming here-->

when m=1 kg and (T<sub>2</sub> - T<sub>1</sub>) = 1 K
then the heat capacity is referred as specific
heat capacity. The equation 7.18 becomes
c = q

Thus specific heat capacity of a
system is defined as “The heat absorbed
by one kilogram of a substance to raise its
temperature by one Kelvin at a specified
temperature”.

The heat capacity for 1 mole of
substance, is called molar heat capacity
(c<sub>m</sub>). It is defined as “The amount of heat
absorbed by one mole of the substance to
raise its temperature by 1 kelvin”.

**<ins>Units of Heat Capacity:</ins>**

The SI unit of molar heat capacity
is JK<sup>-1</sup>mol<sup>-1</sup>

The molar heat capacities can be
expressed either at constant volume (C<sub>v</sub>)
or at constant pressure (C<sub>p</sub>).

According to the first law of
thermodynamics

U = q + w or U = q - PdV

q = U + PdV ---------------------(7.19)

Differentiate (7.19) with respect to
temperature at constant volume i.e dV=0,

<!-- equation comming here-->

Thus the heat capacity at constant
volume (C<sub>V</sub>) is defined as the rate of
change of internal energy with respect to
temperature at constant volume.
Similarly the molar heat capacity at
constant pressure (C<sub>P</sub>) can be defined as
the rate of change of enthalpy with respect
to temperature at constant pressure.

<!-- equation coming soon-->

**<ins>Relation between Cp and Cv for an ideal gas.</ins>**


From the definition of enthalpy

H=U+PV ------(7.8)

for 1 mole of an ideal gas

PV = nRT -----(7.22)

By substituting (7.22) in (7.8)

H = U + nRT ---- (7.23)

Differentiating the above equation with
respect to T,

At constant pressure processes,
a system has to do work against the
surroundings. Hence, the system would
require more heat to effect a given
temperature rise than at constant volume,
so C<sub>p</sub> is always greater than C<sub>v</sub>

### <ins>Calculation of ΔU and ΔH</ins>

For one mole of an ideal gas, we have

C<sub>v</sub> = dU /dt

For a finite change, we have

ΔU = C<sub>V</sub> ΔT

ΔU= C<sub>V</sub> (T<sub>2</sub> – T<sub>1</sub>)

and for n moles of an ideal gas we get

ΔU = n C<sub>v</sub>(T<sub>2</sub> – T<sub>1</sub>) –––––––––– (7.25)

Similarly for n moles of an ideal gas we get

Δ H = n CP (T<sub>2</sub>-T<sub>1</sub>)–––––– (7.26)

**Problem 7.3**

Calculate the value of ΔU and ΔH
on heating 128.0 g of oxygen from 0o C
to 1000 C. C<sub>V</sub> and C<sub>P</sub> on an average are
21 and 29 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>. (The difference is
8Jmol-1 K-1 which is approximately equal
to R)

**Solution.**

We know

ΔU = n C<sub>v</sub> (T<sub>2</sub>-T<sub>1</sub>)

ΔU = n C<sub>P</sub> (T<sub>2</sub>-T<sub>1</sub>)

Here n =  128 /32 = 4 moles ;

T2 = 100<sup>0</sup> C =373K; T<sub>1</sub> = 00 C = 273K

ΔU = n C<sub>v</sub> (T<sub>2</sub>-T<sub>1</sub>)

ΔU = 4 x 21 x (373 - 273)

ΔU = 8400 J

ΔU = 8.4 KJ

ΔH = n C<sub>p</sub> (T<sub>2</sub>- T<sub>1</sub>)

ΔH = 4 × 29 × (373- 273)

ΔH = 11600 J

ΔH = 11.6 kJ

### <ins>7.7 Measurement of ΔU and ΔH using Calorimetry.</ins><hr>

Calorimeter is used for measuring
the amount of heat change in a chemical
or physical change. In calorimetry, the
temperature change in the process is
measured which is inversely proportional
to the heat change. By using the expression
C = q/mΔT, we can calculate the amount
of heat change in the process. Calorimetric
measurements are made under two
different conditions

i) At constant volume (q<sub>V</sub>)

ii) At constant pressure (q<sub>p</sub>)

**(A) ΔU Measurements**

For chemical reactions, heat
evolved at constant volume, is measured
in a bomb calorimeter.

The inner vessel (the bomb) and its
cover are made of strong steel. The cover
is fitted tightly to the vessel by means of
metal lid and screws.


![Figure 7.6 Bomb calorimeter:](/books/chemistry/part-1/thermodynamics/pic6.png)

A weighed amount of the substance
is taken in a platinum cup connected with
electrical wires for striking an arc instantly
to kindle combustion. The bomb is then
tightly closed and pressurized with excess
oxygen. The bomb is immersed in water,
in the inner volume of the calorimeter.
A stirrer is placed in the space between
the wall of the calorimeter and the bomb,
so that water can be stirred, uniformly.
The reaction is started by striking the
substance through electrical heating.

A known amount of combustible
substance is burnt in oxygen in the
bomb. Heat evolved during the reaction
is absorbed by the calorimeter as well as
the water in which the bomb is immersed.
The change in temperature is measured
using a Beckman thermometer. Since the
bomb is sealed its volume does not change
and hence the heat measurements is equal
to the heat of combustion at a constant
volume (ΔU<sub>c</sub><sup>0</sup>).

The amount of heat produced in
the reaction (ΔU<sub>c</sub><sup>0</sup>) is equal to the sum of
the heat abosrbed by the calorimeter and
water.


Heat absorbed by the calorimeter

q<sub>1</sub> = k.ΔT

where k is a calorimeter constant
equal to m<sub>c</sub>C<sub>c</sub> ( m<sub>c</sub> is mass of the
calorimeter and C<sub>c</sub> is heat capacity of
calorimeter)

Heat absorbed by the water

q<sub>2</sub> = m<sub>w</sub> C<sub>w</sub> ΔT

where m<sub>w</sub> is molar mass of water

C<sub>w</sub> is molar heat capacity of water
(75.29 J K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>).

Therefore ΔU<sub></sub>c = q<sub>1</sub> + q<sub>2</sub>

= k.ΔT + m<sub>w</sub>C<sub>w</sub> ΔT

= (k+m<sub>w</sub> C<sub>w</sub>)ΔT

Calorimeter constant can be determined
by burning a known mass of standard
sample (benzoic acid) for which the heat
of combustion is known (-3227 kJmol<sup>-1</sup>

The enthalpy of combustion at
constant pressure of the substance is
calculated from the equation (7.17)

ΔHC<sup>0</sup>
(pressure) = ΔU<sub>c</sub><sup>0</sup>
(Vol) + Δn<sub>g</sub>RT


**Applications of bomb** **calorimeter:**

1. Bomb calorimeter is used to determine
the amount of heat released in
combustion reaction.

2. It is used to determine the calorific
value of food.

3. Bomb calorimeter is used in many
industries such as metabolic study, food
processing, explosive testing etc.


**(b) ΔH Measurements**

Heat change at constant pressure (at
atmospheric pressure) can be measured
using a coffee cup calorimeter. A schematic
representation of a coffee cup calorimeter
is given in Figure 7.7. Instead of bomb, a
styrofoam cup is used in this calorimeter.
It acts as good adiabatic wall and doesn't
allow transfer of heat produced during
the reaction to its surrounding. This
entire heat energy is absorbed by the
water inside the cup. This method can be
used for the reactions where there is noappreciable change in volume. The change
in the temperature of water is measured
and used to calculate the amount of heat
that has been absorbed or evolved in the
reaction using the following expression.


q = m<sub>w</sub> C<sub>w</sub> ΔT

where m<sub>w</sub> is the molar mass of
water and C<sub>w</sub> is the molar heat capacity of
water (75.29 J K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>)

**Problem 7. 4**

Calculate the enthalpy of combustion of
ethylene at 300 K at constant pressure, if
its heat of combustion at constant volume
(ΔU) is −1406 kJ .

The complete ethylene combustion

C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO<sub>2</sub> (g)+2H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

ΔU = −1406 kJ

Δn = np<sub>(g)</sub> - nr<sub>(g)</sub>

Δn = 2 - 4 = -2

ΔH = ΔU + RTΔn<sub>g</sub>

ΔH = -1406 + (8.314 × 10-3 × 300 ×(-2)

ΔH = -1410.9 kJ

{{< /box >}}


**Applications of the heat of combustion:**

**(1) Calculation of heat of**
**formation:** Since the heat of combustion
of organic compounds can be determined
with considerable ease, they are employed
to calculate the heat of formation of other
compounds.

For example let us calculate
the standard enthalpy of formation
ΔH<sub>f</sub>0 of CH<sub>4</sub> from the values
of enthalpy of combustion for
H<sub>2</sub>, C(graphite) and CH<sub>4</sub> which are - 285.8,
- 393.5, and -890.4 kJ mol-1 respectively.

Let us interpret the information
about enthalpy of formation by writing
out the equations. It is important to note
that the standard enthalpy of formation
of pure elemental gases and elements
is assumed to be zero under standard
conditions. Thermochemical equation
for the formation of methane from its
constituent elements is,

C<sub>(graphite)</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>(g) → CH<sub>4</sub>(g)

ΔH<sub>f</sub><sup>0</sup> = X kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>    --- (i)

Thermo chemical equations for the
combustion of given substances are,

H<sub>2</sub>(g)+1/2O<sub>2</sub>--> H<sub>2</sub>0(I)


ΔH0 = –285.8 kJ <sup>-1</sup>--- (ii)

C<sub>(graphite)</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → CO<sub>2</sub>

ΔH0 = –393.5 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>--- (iii)

CH<sub>4</sub>(g) + 2 O<sub>2</sub> → CO<sub>2</sub>(g)+ 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

ΔH0 = –890.4 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>--- (iv)

Since methane is in the product side
of the required equation (i), we have to
reverse the equation (iv)

CO<sub>2</sub> (g)+2 H<sub>2</sub>O (l) → CH<sub>4</sub> (g) + 2 O<sub>2</sub>

ΔH0 = + 890.4 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>--- (v)

In order to get equation (i) from the
remaining,


(i) = [(ii) × 2] + (iii) + (v)

X = [(–285.8) × 2] + [–393.5] + [+ 890.4]

= –74.7 kJ

Hence, the amount of energy required
for the formation of 1 mole of methane is
-74.7 kJ

The heat of formation methane =
-74.7 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>.

**(2) Calculation of calorific**
**value of food and fuels:** The calorific
value is defined as the amount of heat
produced in calories (or joules) when one
gram of the substance is completely burnt.
The SI unit of calorific value is J kg<sup>-1</sup>.
However, it is usually expressed in cal g<sup>-1</sup>.

**Heat of solution:**

Heat changes are usually observed
when a substance is dissolved in a solvent.
The heat of solution is defined as the
change in enthalpy when one mole of
a substance is dissolved in a specified
quantity of solvent at a given temperature.

**Heat of neutralisation:**

The heat of neutralisation is defined
as “The change in enthalpy when one
gram equivalent of an acid is completely
neutralised by one gram equivalent of a
base or vice versa in dilute solution”.

HCl(aq)+NaOH(aq)→ NaCl (aq)+ H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

ΔH = – 57.32 kJ

H+(aq) + OH-(aq) → H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

ΔH = – 57.32 kJ

The heat of neutralisation of a
strong acid and strong base is around –
57.32 kJ, irrespective of nature of acid or
base used which is evident from the below
mentioned examples.

HCl (aq) + KOH(aq) → KCl (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

ΔH = – 57.32 kJ

HNO<sub>3</sub>(aq)+KOH(aq) → KNO<sub>3</sub>(aq)+ H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

ΔH = – 57.32 kJ

H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>(aq) + 2KOH(aq) →

K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>(aq) + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

ΔH = – 57.32 kJ x 2

The reason for this can be explained
on the basis of Arrhenius theory of acids
and bases which states that strong acids
and strong bases completely ionise in
aqueous solution to produce H+ and OH-
ions respectively. Therefore in all the above
mentioned reactions the neutralisation
can be expressed as follows.

H+(aq) + OH-(aq) → H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

ΔH = – 57.32 kJ

**Molar heat of fusion**

The molar heat of fusion is defined
as “the change in enthalpy when one mole
of a solid substance is converted into the
liquid state at its melting point”.

For example, the heat of fusion of
ice can be represented as
                  
H<sub>2</sub>O(s)  ___273k_______> H2O(l) ΔH<sub>fusion</sub> = + 5.98kJ 


**Molar heat of vapourisation**

The molar heat of vaporisation is
defined as “the change in enthalpy when
one mole of liquid is converted into
vapour state at its boiling point”.

For example, heat of vaporisation
of water can be represented as

H<sub>2</sub>O(l) __373k______>H2O(v)  ΔH<sub>vap</sub>= + 40.626 kJ 

**Molar heat of sublimation**

Sublimation is a process when a
solid changes directly into its vapour state
without changing into liquid state. Molar
heat of sublimation is defined as “the
change in enthalpy when one mole of a
solid is directly converted into the vapour
state at its sublimation temperature”. For
example, the heat of sublimation of iodine
is represented as

I<sub>2</sub>(s)__373k________> I2(v) ΔH<sub.sub> = + 62.42 kJ 


Another example of sublimation process
is solid CO<sub>2</sub> to gas at atmospheric pressure
at very low temperatures.

**Heat of transition**

The heat of transition is defined as
“The change in enthalpy when one mole
of an element changes from one of its
allotropic form to another. For example,
the transition of diamond into graphite
may be represented as

C<sub>(diamond)</sub> C<sub>(graphite)</sub>

ΔH<sub>trans</sub>= +13.81 kJ

Similarly the allotropic transitions in
sulphur and phsphorous can be represented
as follows,

S<sub>(monoclinic)</sub> S<sub>(rhombic)</sub>

ΔHtrans= – 0.067 kJ

P<sub>(white)</sub>------------>  P(red)

ΔHtrans = – 4.301 kJ

**7.8 Hess’s law of constant heat summation**

We have already seen that the heat
changes in chemical reactions are equal
to the difference in internal energy (ΔU)
or heat content (ΔH) of the products and
reactants, depending upon whether the
reaction is studied at constant volume
or constant pressure. Since ΔU and ΔH
are functions of the state of the system,
the heat evolved or absorbed in a given
reaction depends only on the initial state
and final state of the system and not on
the path or the steps by which the change
takes place.

This generalisation is known as
**Hess’s law** and stated as:

The enthalpy change of a reaction
either at constant volume or constant
pressure is the same whether it takes place
in a single or multiple steps provided the
initial and final states are same.

**Application of Hess's Law:** Hess's law can be
applied to calculate enthalpies of reactions
that are difficult to measure. For example,
it is very difficult to measure the heat of
combustion of graphite to give pure CO.

However, enthalpy for the oxidation of
graphite to CO2 and CO to CO2 can easily
be measured. For these conversions, the
heat of combustion values are –393.5 kJ
and – 283.5 kJ respectively.

From these data the enthalpy of
combustion of graphite to CO can be
calculated by applying Hess's law.

The reactions involved in this process can
be expressed as follows
O2(g) C(graphite)

ΔH<sub>1</sub> = ΔH<sub>2</sub> + ΔH<sub>3</sub>

–393.5 kJ= X – 283.5 kJ

X= -110.5 kJ

**7.9 Lattice energy (ΔH<sub>lattice</sub>)**

Lattice energy is defined as the
amount of energy required to completely
remove the constituent ions from its
crystal lattice to an infinite distance from
one mole of crystal. It is also referred as
lattice enthalpy.

NaCl(s) → Na<sup>+</sup>(g) + Cl<sup>-</sup>(g)

ΔH<sub>lattice</sub> = + 788 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

From the above equation it is clear
that 788 kJ of energy is required to separate
Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions from 1 mole of NaCl.

**Born - Haber cycle**

The Born–Haber cycle is an
approach to analyse reaction energies. It
was named after two German scientists
Max Born and Fritz Haber who developed
this cycle. The cycle is concerned with the
formation of an ionic compound from the
reaction of a metal with a halogen or other
non-metallic element such as oxygen.

Born–Haber cycle is primarily used
in calculating lattice energy, which cannot
be measured directly. The Born–Haber
cycle applies Hess's law to calculate the
lattice enthalpy. For example consider the
formation of a simple ionic solid such as
an alkali metal halide MX, the following
steps are considered.

ΔH<sub>1</sub> - enthalpy change for the sublimation
M(s) to M(g)

ΔH<sub>2</sub>- enthalpy change for the dissociation of 1/2X2(g)toX(g).

ΔH<sub>3</sub>- Ionisation energy for M(g) to M<sup>+</sup>(g)

ΔH<sub>4</sub> - electron affinity for the conversion
of X(g) to X<sup>-</sup>(g)

U - the lattice enthalpy for the formation
of solid MX

ΔH<sub>f</sub>- enthalpy change for the formation of
solid MX directly form elements
According to Hess's law of heat summation

∆H<sub>f</sub> =∆H<sub>1</sub> +∆H<sub>2</sub> +∆H<sub>3</sub> +∆H<sub>4</sub>+U

Let us use the Born - Haber cycle for
determining the lattice enthalpy of NaCl
as follows:

Since the reaction is carried out with
reactants in elemental forms and products
in their standard states, at 1 bar, the overall
enthalpy change of the reaction is also the
enthalpy of formation for NaCl. Also, the
formation of NaCl can be considered in 5
steps. The sum of the enthalpy changes of
these steps is equal to the enthalpy change
for the overall reaction from which the
lattice enthalpy of NaCl is calculated.

 Let us calculate the lattice energy of
sodium chloride using Born-Haber cycle

∆H<sub>f</sub> = heat of formation of sodium chloride = – 411.3 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

∆H<sub>1</sub> = heat of sublimation of Na(g) =
108.7 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

∆H<sub>2</sub> = ionisation energy of Na(g) =
495.0 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>.

∆H<sub>3</sub> = dissociation energy of Cl2(g)
= 244 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

∆H<sub>4</sub> = Electron affinity of Cl(S)=
– 349.0 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

U = lattice energy of NaCl

∆H<sub>f</sub> = ∆H<sub>1</sub> + ∆H<sub>2</sub> + 1/2 ∆H<sub>3</sub> + ∆H<sub>4</sub> +U

therfore U = (∆H<sub>f</sub>) -  (∆)H<sub>1</sub> + ∆H<sub>2</sub> + 1/2 ∆H<sub>3</sub> + ∆H<sub>4</sub>)

⇒ U = (–411.3) – (108.7 + 495.0 + 122 –
349)

 U = (–411.3) – (376.7)

 ∴ U = – 788 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

 This negative sign in lattice energy indicates
that the energy is released when sodium is
formed from its constituent gaseous ions Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>.

##### 7.10. Second Law of thermodynamics:

###### Need for the second law of thermodynamics:

We know from the first law of
thermodynamics, the energy of the
universe is conserved. Let us consider the
following processes:

1. A glass of hot water over time loses
heat energy to the surrounding and
becomes cold.

2. When you mix hydrochloric acid with
sodium hydroxide, it forms sodium
chloride and water with evolution of
heat.

In both these processes, the total
energy is conserved and are consistent
with the first law of thermodynamics.
However, the reverse process i.e. cold
water becoming hot water by absorbing
heat from surrounding on its own does
not occur spontaneously even though the
energy change involved in this process is
also consistent with the first law. However,
if the heat energy is supplied to cold water,
then it will become hot. i.e. the change
that does not occur spontaneously and an
be driven by supplying energy.

Similarly, a solution of sodium
chloride does not absorb heat energy
on its own, to form hydrochloric acid
and sodium hydroxide. But, this process
can not be driven even by supplying
energy. From these kinds of our natural
experiences, we have come to know that
certain processes are spontaneous while
the others are not, and some processes
have a preferred direction. In order to
explain the feasibility of a process, we
need the second law of thermodynamics.

##### 7.10.1 Various statements of the second law of thermodynamics

###### Entropy

The second law of thermodynamics
introduces another state function called
entropy. Entropy is a measure of the
molecular disorder (randomness) of a
system. But thermodynamic definition of
entropy is concerned with the change in
entropy that occurs as a result of a process.

It is defined as, dS = dqrev / T

##### Entropy statement:

The second law of thermodynamics
can be expressed in terms of entropy.
i.e “the entropy of an isolated system
increases during a spontaneous process”.
For an irreversible process such as
spontaneous expansion of a gas,

ΔS<sub>total</sub> > 0

ΔS<sub>total</sub> > ΔS<sub>system</sub> + ΔS<sub>surrounding</sub>

i.e. ΔS<sub>total</sub> > ΔS<sub>system</sub> + ΔS<sub>surrounding</sub>

For a reversible process such as melting of
ice,

ΔS<sub>system</sub> = - ΔS<sub>surrounding</sub>

ΔS<sub>total</sub> = 0

**Kelvin-Planck statement:**

It is impossible to construct a machine
that absorbs heat from a hot source and
converts it completely into work by a
cyclic process without transferring a part
of heat to a cold sink. The second law of
thermodynamics explains why even an
ideal, frictionless engine cannot convert
100% of its input heat into work. Carnot
on his analysis of heat engines, found that
the maximum efficiency of a heat engine
which operates reversibly, depends only
on the two temperatures between which it
is operated.

Efficiency = work performed / heat
absorbed

η = (q<sub>h</sub> - q<sub>r</sub>) / q<sub>h</sub>

q<sub>h</sub> - heat absorbed from the hot reservoir

q<sub>c</sub> - heat transferred to cold reservoir

η = 1- q<sub>c</sub> / q<sub>h</sub> --- (7.27) 

For a reversible cyclic process

ΔS<sub>total</sub> = ΔS<sub>system</sub> + ΔS<sub>surroundings</sub>= 0

ΔS<sub>system</sub> = - ΔS<sub>surroundings</sub>

q<sub>h</sub> / T<sub>h</sub> = -q<sub>c</sub> /t<sub>c</sub>

T<sub>c</sub> / T<sub>h</sub>  = -q<sub>c</sub> / q<sub>h</sub>

T<sub>c</sub> / T<sub>h</sub>  = -q<sub>c</sub> / q<sub>h</sub> ----> 7.28

Sustituting 7.28 into 7.27

⇒  η = T<sub>c</sub> / T<sub>h</sub> −−−−−−> 7.29

T<sub>h</sub> >> T<sub>c</sub>

Hence, η < 1

efficiency in percentage can be expressed
as 

Efficiency  in percentage  = [ 1-( T<sub>c</sub> / T<sub>h</sub>) ]

Clausius statement:
It is impossible to transfer heat
from a cold reservoir to a hot reservoir
without doing some work.

**Problem: 7.10**

If an automobile engine burns
petrol at a temperature of 816o C and if
the surrounding temperature is 21o C,
calculate its maximum possible efficiency.

**Solution:**

% Efficiency = [ T<sub>h</sub>- T<sub>c</sub> / T<sub>h</sub>]  * 100

Here

T<sub>h</sub> = 816+273= 1089 K;


T<sub>c</sub>  = 21+273= 294K


% Efficiency = [ 1089 -294 / 1089] * 100

% Efficiency=73%

An engine operating between 1270 C
and 470 C takes some specified amount

**Unit of entropy:**

The entropy (S) is equal to heat
energy exchanged (q) divided by the
temperature (T) at which the exchange
takes place. Therefore, The SI unit of
entropy is JK<sup>-1</sup>.

**Spontaneity and Randomness**

Careful examination shows that
in each of the processes viz., melting of
ice and evaporation of water, there is an
increase in randomness or disorder of
the system. The water molecules in ice
are arranged in a highly organised crystal
pattern which permits little movement. As
the ice melts, the water molecules become
disorganised and can move more freely.
The movement of molecules becomes
freer in the liquid phase and even more
free in the vapour phase. In other words,
we can say that the randomness of the
water molecules increases, as ice melts
into water or water evaporates. Both are
spontaneous processes which result in a
increase in randomness (entropy).


![Figure 7.8 Illustration showing an increase in disorder.](/books/chemistry/part-1/thermodynamics/pic8.png)

**Standard Entropy Change(ΔS<sup>0</sup>):**

It is possible to calculate the actual
entropy of a substance at any temperature
above 0 K. The absolute entropy of a
substance at 298 K and one bar pressure is
called the standard entropy So

. The third
law of thermodynamics states, according
to Nernst, that the absolute entropy of
elements is zero only at 0 K in a perfect
crystal, and standard entropies of all
substances at any temperature above 0 K
always have positive values. Once we know
the entropies of different substances, we
can calculate the standard entropy change
( ∆Sr<sup>0</sup> ) for chemical reactions.

( ∆Sr<sup>0</sup>) = E S<sup>0</sup><sub>products></sub> - E S<sup>0</sup><sub>rectants
</sub>


Standard Entropy of Formation:
Standard entropy of formation is
defined as “the entropy of formation of 1
mole of a compound from the elements
under standard conditions”. It is denoted
>as ∆Sf<suP>0</suP>. We can calculate the value of
entropy of a given compound from the
values of S0 of elements.

**Problem: 7.6**

Calculate the standard entropy
change for the following reaction( ∆Sf<sup>0</sup>),
given the standard entropies of CO<sub>2</sub>(g),
C(s),O<sub>2</sub>(g) as 213.6 , 5.740 and 205 JK<sup>-1</sup>
respectively.

C(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g) → CO<sub>2</sub>(g)


( ∆Sr<sup>0</sup>) = E S<sup>0</sup><sub>products></sub> - E S<sup>0</sup><sub>rectants
</sub>

( ∆Sr<sup>0</sup>) = 213.6 - [5.74+205]

( ∆Sr<sup>0</sup>) = 213.6 - [210.74]

( ∆Sr<sup>0</sup>) = 2.86 JK<sup>-1</sup>

respectively. Calculate the entropy

**Entropy change accompanying change**
**of phase**


When there is a change of state from
solid to liquid (melting), liquid to
vapour (evaporation) or solid to vapour
(sublimation) there is a change in entropy.
This change may be carried out at constant
temperature reversibly as two phases are
in equilibrium during the change.

**Entropy of fusion:**

The heat absorbed, when one mole of a
solid melts at its melting point reversibly,
is called molar heat of fusion. The entropy
change for this process is given by


( ∆S<sub>rev</sub>) = dq<sub>rev</sub> / T


( ∆S<sub>fusion</sub>) = ( ∆H<sub>fusion</sub>) / T<sub>f</sub>  --- > 7.32

where ΔH<sub>fusion</sub> is Molar heat of fusion. Tf
is the melting point.

**Entropy of vapourisation:**

The heat absorbed, when one mole of liquid
is boiled at its boiling point reversibly, is
called molar heat of vapourisation. The
entropy change is given by

 ∆S<sub>v</sub>  =   ∆H<sub>v</sub> / T<sub>h</sub>  ......>(7.33)

 where ΔH<sub>v</sub> is Molar heat of vaporisation.
T<sub>b</sub> is the boiling point.

**Entropy of transition:**

The heat change, when one mole
of a solid changes reversibly from one
allotropic form to another at its transition
temperature is called enthalpy of
transition. The entropy change is given

 ∆S<sub>t</sub> =  ∆H<sub>t</sub>  / T<sub>h</sub> ------->   7.34

where ΔH<sub>t</sub> is the molar heat of transition, T<sub>t</sub> is the transition temperature.

**Problem: 7.7**

T<sub>f</sub> = 0<sup>o</sup> C = 273 k

H<sub>2</sub>O(S) = H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

∆S<sub>fusion</sub> = ∆H<sub>fusion</sub>  / T<sub>f</sub>

**7.11 Gibbs free energy (G)**

One of the important applications
of the second law of thermodynamics is to
predict the spontaneity of a reaction under
a specific set of conditions. A reaction that
occurs under the given set of conditions
without any external driving force is
called a spontaneous reaction. Otherwise,
it is said to be non-spontaneous. In our
day today life, we observe many
spontaneous physical and chemical
processes, which includes the following
examples.

1. A waterfall runs downhill, but never
uphill, spontaneously.

2. A lump of sugar dissolves spontaneously
in a cup of coffee, but never reappears
in its original form spontaneously.

3. Heat flows from hotter object to a
colder one, but never flows from colder
to hotter object spontaneously.

4. The expansion of a gas into an evacuated
bulb is a spontaneous process, the
reverse process that is gathering of
all molecules into one bulb is not.
spontaneous.

![Figure 7.9 Spontaneous process illustration](/books/chemistry/part-1/thermodynamics/pic9.png)

These examples show that the
processes that occur spontaneously in one
direction, cannot take place in opposite
direction spontaneously.

Similarly a large number of
exothermic reactions are spontaneous. An
example is combustion of methane.

CH<sub>4</sub>+ 2O<sub>2</sub> → CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O

ΔH<sup>0</sup> = −890.4 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

Another example is acid-base
neutralization reaction:

H<sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>-</sup> → H<sub>2</sub>O


ΔH<sup>0</sup> = −57.32 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

However, some endothermic
processes are also spontaneous. For
example ammonium nitrate dissolves
in water spontaneously though this
dissolution is endothermic.

From the above examples we can
come to the conclusion that exothermicity
favors the spontaneity but does not
guarantee it. We cannot decide whether
or not a chemical reaction will occur
spontaneously solely on the basis of
energy changes in the system. We know
from second law of thermodynamics that
in a spontaneous process, the entropy
increases. But not all the processes which
are accompanied by an increase in entropy
are spontaneous. In order to predict the
spontaneity of a reaction, we need some
other thermodynamic function.

The second law of thermodynamics
introduces another thermodynamic
function called Gibbs free energy which
finds useful in predicting the spontaneity
of a reaction. The Gibbs free energy (G)
was developed in the 1870’s by Josiah
Willard Gibbs. He originally termed this
energy as the “available energy” to do work
in a system. This quantity is the energy
associated with a chemical reaction that
can be used to do work.

Gibbs free energy is defined as below

G = H - TS ------------ (7.35)

Gibbs free energy (G) is an
extensive property and it is a single valued
state function.

Let us consider a system which
undergoes a change of state from state (1)
to state (2) at constant temperature.

G<sub>2</sub> – G<sub>1</sub> = (H<sub>2</sub> – H<sub>1</sub>) – T(S<sub>2</sub> – S<sub>1</sub>)


ΔG =ΔH – T ΔS−−−−−−(7.36)

Now let us consider how ΔG is
related to reaction spontaneity.

We know that

ΔS<sub>total</sub> = ΔS<sub>Sys</sub> + ΔS<sub>surr</sub>

For a reversible process
(equilibrium), the change in entropy of
universe is zero. ΔS<sub>total</sub> = 0

[∴ΔS<sub>Sys</sub> = − ΔS <sub>surr</sub>]

Similarly, for an equilibrium process
ΔG=0

For spontaneous process, ΔS<sub>total</sub>>0


ΔS<sub>sys</sub> + ΔS<sub>surr</sub> >0

ΔS<sub>sys</sub> + dq<sub>sys</sub> >0

ΔS<sub>sys</sub> – ΔH<sub>sys</sub> >0

TΔS<sub>sys</sub> − ΔH<sub>sys</sub> >0

− (ΔH<sub>sys</sub> − TΔS<sub>sys</sub>)>0

− ΔG>0

hence for a spontaneous process,

ΔG < 0

i.e. ΔH – T ΔS < 0 −−−−−−(7.37)

ΔH<sub>sys</sub> is the enthalpy change of
a reaction, TΔSsys is the energy which is
not available to do useful work. So ΔG
is the net energy available to do useful
work and is thus a measure of the ‘free
energy’. For this reason, it is also known
as the free energy of the reaction. For non
spontaneous process, ΔG > 0

**Gibbs free energy and the net work done**
**by the system:**

For any system at constant pressure
and temperature

ΔG = ΔH – T ΔS −−−− (7.36)

We know that,

ΔH =ΔU + PΔV

∴ ΔG = ΔU + PΔV – TΔS

from first law of thermodynamics
if work is done by the system

ΔU = q – w

from second law of thermodynamics

∆ = S q / t

∆ = q - w + P∆V  - T [ q/t]

ΔG = –w + PΔV

−ΔG = w − PΔV ............(7.38)

Here, −PΔV represents the work
done due to expansion against a constant
external pressure. Therefore, it is clear
that the decrease in free energy (–ΔG)
accompanying a process taking place
at constant temperature and pressure is
equal to the maximum work obtainable
from the system other than the work of
expansion.

**7.11.1 Criteria for spontaneity of a process**

The spontaneity of any process depends
on three different factors.

• If the enthalpy change of a process
is negative, then the process is
exothermic and may be spontaneous.
(ΔH is negative)

• If the entropy change of a process is
positive, then the process may occur
spontaneously. (ΔS is positive)

• The gibbs free energy which is the combination of the above two (ΔH -TΔS) should
be negative for a reaction to occur spontaneously, i.e. the necessary condition for a
reaction to be spontaneous is ΔH -TΔS < 0

The Table assumes ΔH and ΔS will remain
the way indicated for all temperatures.
It may not be necessary that way. The
Spontaneity of a chemical reaction is only
the potential for the reaction to proceed
as written. The rate of such processes is
determined by kinetic factors, outside of
thermodynamical prediction.

**7.11.2 Relationship between standard free energy change ΔG<sup>0</sup><sub>****(reaction)</sub> and equilibrium constant (K<sub>eq</sub>):**

In a reversible process, the system is in
perfect equilibrium with its surroundings
at all times. A reversible chemical
reaction can proceed in either direction
simultaneously, so that a dynamic
equilibrium is set up. This means that the
reactions in both the directions should
proceed with decrease in free energy,
which is impossible. It is possible only if
at equilibrium, the free energy of a system
is minimum. Lets consider a general equilibrium reaction

A+B ⇌ C + D

The free energy change of the
above reaction in any state (ΔG) is related
to the standard free energy change of the
reaction (ΔG<sup>0</sup> ) according to the following
equation.


ΔG= ΔG<sup>0</sup> + RT ln Q −−−−−−(7.39)

where Q is reaction quotient and
is defined as the ratio of concentration
of the products to the concentrations
of the reactants under non equilibrium
condition.


When equilibrium is attained, there
is no further free energy change i.e. ΔG
= 0 and Q becomes equal to equilibrium
constant. Hence the above equation
becomes.

  ΔG<sup>0</sup> = –RT ln Keq

  This equation is known as Van’t
Hoff equation.

ΔG<sup>0</sup> = –2.303 RT log Keq ----------(7.40)

We also know that
ΔG<sup>0</sup>= ΔH<sup>0</sup> – T ΔS<sup>0</sup> = − RT ln Keq


**Problem: 7.9**

Calculate ΔG<sup>0</sup> for conversion of
oxygen to ozone 3/2 O2 O3(g) at 298
K, if Kp for this conversion is 2.47 × 10−29
in standard pressure units.
Solution:

ΔG<sup>0</sup> = − 2.303 RT log K<sub>p</sub>

Where

R = 8.314 JK<sup>-1</sup>mol<sup>-1</sup>

K<sub>p</sub> = 2.47 × 10−29

T = 298K

ΔG<sup>0</sup>=−2.303(8.314)(298)log(2.47×10<sup>-29</sup>)

ΔG<sup>0</sup> = 163229 Jmol<sup>-1</sup>

ΔG<sup>0</sup> = 163.229 KJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

**7.12 Third law of Thermodynamics**

The entropy of a substance varies
directly with temperature. Lower the
temperature, lower is the entropy. For
example, water above 1000 C at one
atmosphere exists as a gas and has higher
entropy (higher disorder). The water
molecules are free to roam about in
the entire container. When the system
is cooled, the water vapour condenses
to form a liquid. The water molecules
in liquid phase still can move about
somewhat freely. Thus the entropy of
the system has decreased. On further
cooling, water freezes to form ice crystal.
The water molecules in the ice crystal are
highly ordered and entropy of the system
is very low.

If we cool the solid crystal still
further, the vibration of molecules held
in the crystal lattice gets slower and they
have very little freedom of movement
(very little disorder) and hence very small
entropy.

At absolute zero {0 K (or) − 2730C},
theoretically all modes of motion stop.

Absolute zero is a temperature that an object can get arbitrarily close to but absolute zero will remain unattainable.

Thus the third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of pure crystalline
substance at absolute zero is zero. Otherwise it can be stated as it is impossible to lower the temperature of an object to absolute zero in a finite number of steps. 

Mathematically,

T<sup>tim</sup> --> 0<sup>S=0</sup> for a perfectly ordered crystalline state.



![Figure 7.10 Third law of Thermodynamics](/books/chemistry/part-1/thermodynamics/pic10.png)

Crystals with defects (imperfection) at absolute zero, have entropy greater than zero.
Absolute entropy of a substance can never be negative.



### SUMMARY

The branch of science which deals
the relation between energy, heat and work
is called Thermodynamics. The main aim
of the study of chemical thermodynamics
is to learn (i) transformation of energy
from one form into another form (ii)
Utilization of various forms of energies.

System: A system is defined as
any part of universe under consideration.
There are three types of thermodynamic
systems. They are (i) isolated system (ii)
closed system and (iii) open system.

**Surrounding**: Everything in the
universe that is not the part of the system
is called surrounding.

**Boundary:** Anything which
separates the system from its surrounding
is called boundary.

**Thermodynamic Properties:**

Any quantity that depends only on the
state of system is called thermodynamic
property of a system. There are two kinds
of thermodynamic properties called (1)
intensive - independent of the quantity
of material and (2) extensive - directly
proportional to the quantity of material.
There are five basic thermodynamic
properties. (U,H,S and G)


**Thermodynamic Processes:**

Adiabatic process in which no heat
transfer takes place (q = 0)
Isothermal process in which
temperature remains constant (dT =0).

Isobaric process in which pressure
remains constant(dP =0).

Isochoric process in which volume
remains constant(dV =0).

Cyclic process in which the system
returns to its original state after completing
a series of changes.

**Internal energy (U):** Internal
energy of a system is equal to the energy
possessed by all its constituents namely
atoms, ions and molecules. The energy of
a system of molecules is equal to the sum
of its translational energy, vibrational
energy, rotational energy, bond energy,
electronic energy and energy due to
molecular interactions.

**Heat:** Heat is regarded as the energy in
transit across the boundary separating
a system from its surrounding. Heat is a
path function. The SI unit of heat is joule
(J)

**Work :** Work is defined as the force (F)
multiplied by the displacement -w=F.x,
work is measured in Joules, i.e the SI
unit of work is Joule. During expansion
or compression of a gas the work done is
calculated by the relation w= -P∆V.

The sign conventions for heat and work
are as follows:
If heat is absorbed by the system : +q

If heat is evolved by the system : -q

If work is done by the system : -w

If work is done on the system : +w

**Laws of Thermodynamics:**

**Zeroth law :** When two systems
are separately in equilibrium with a third
system, they are in equilibrium with each
other.


**First law:** "Energy can neither
be created nor destroyed, but may be
converted from one form to another".
∆U = q + w.

Enthalpy is a thermodynamic
property of a system. Enthalpy H is
defined as the sum of the internal energy
and pressure volume work.

H=U+PV.

Enthalpy change, ∆H = ∆U + ∆n<sub>g</sub>RT.

Hess's law: It states that “the enthalpy
change of a reaction either at constant
volume or constant pressure is the same
whether it takes place in a single or
multiple steps”. Hess's law can be applied
to calculate enthalpies of reactions that
are difficult to measure.
Heat capacities: [Cp and Cv]
Heat capacity is defined as the
amount of energy required to increase
the temperature of one unit quantity of
material by one degree, under specific
conditions. It can be measured under two
different conditions, namely,


(a) constant pressure C<sub>p</sub> = (dH/dT)<sub>p</sub>

(b) constant volume C<sub>v</sub> = (dU/dT)<sub>v</sub>

**Second law of thermodynamics:**

The second law of thermodynamics
helps us to predict whether the reaction is
feasible or not and also tells the direction
of the flow of heat.

To predict spontaneity of a process,
a new thermodynamic quantity namely
entropy (S) was introduced. Entropy
is a measure of the randomness or
disorderliness of the system.

**Entropy statement:** “whenever a
spontaneous process takes place, it is
accompanied by an increase in the total
entropy of the universe”.
Kelvin-Planck statement: It is
impossible to take heat from a hotter
reservoir and convert it completely
into work by a cyclic process without
transferring a part of that heat to a colder
reservoir.

**Clausius statement:** This statement
recognises that heat flows spontaneously
from hot objects to cold objects and to get
it flow in the opposite direction, we have
to spend some work.


**Gibbs Free Energy (G):**

G is expressed as G=H-TS, free
energy change of a process is given by the
relation ∆G= ∆H-T∆S.

Standard free energy change and
equilibrium constants are related by the
equation ∆G<sup>0</sup> = -RTlnK<sub>eq</sub>

**Third law:**
The entropy of a perfectly crystalline
material at absolute zero is zero.
