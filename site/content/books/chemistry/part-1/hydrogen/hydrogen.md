#### 4.1 Introduction

Hydrogen is the simplest atom which
contains one electron and one proton. In
contrast to other elements (except helium)
its valence electron is directly in the sphere of
action of the nucleus. It is invariably present
in most of the compounds we come across
in our daily life such as water, carbohydrate,
proteins etc. As it has an unpaired electron, it
is reactive and exists as a diatomic molecule
(H<sub>2</sub>). However, the abundance of hydrogen
gas in the earth’s atmosphere is very small.

#### 4.1.1 Position in Periodic Table

Th e hydrogen has the electronic
confi guration of 1s1 which resembles with
ns1
general valence shell confi guration of
alkali metals and shows similarity with them
as follows:

1. It forms unipositive ion (H+) like alkali
metals (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup>)

2. It forms halides (HX), oxides (H<sub>2</sub>O),peroxides (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and sulphides (H<sub>2</sub>S) like alkali metals (NaX, Na<sub>2</sub>O, Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,Na<sub>2</sub>S)

3. It also acts as a reducing agent.

However, unlike alkali metals which
have ionization energy ranging from 377 to
520 kJ mol-1, the hydrogen has 1,314 KJ mol<sup>-1</sup>
which is much higher than alkali metals.

Like the formation of halides (X-)
from halogens, hydrogen also has a tendency
to gain one electron to form hydride ion
(H-) whose electronic confi guration is
similar to the noble gas, helium. However,
the electron affi nity of hydrogen is much
less than that of halogen atoms. Hence, the
tendency of hydrogen to form hydride ion
is low compared to that of halogens to form
the halide ions as evident from the following
reactions:

<code> 1⁄2 H<sub>2</sub> + e- → H<sup>-</sup>

ΔH = + 36 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup></code>

<code> 1⁄2 Br<sub>2</sub>  + e- → Br-

ΔH = - 55 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> </code>

Since, hydrogen has similarities
with alkali metals as well as the halogens;
it is diffi cult to fi nd the right position in
the periodic table. However, in most of its
compounds hydrogen exists in +1 oxidation
state. Th erefore, it is reasonable to place
the hydrogen in group 1 along with alkali
metals as shown in the latest periodic table
published by IUPAC.

#### 4.1.2 Isotopes of Hydrogen

Hydrogen has three naturally
occurring isotopes, viz., protium (1
H<sub>1</sub>or H), deuterium (<sub>1</sub>
H<sub>1</sub>or D) and tritium (<sub>1</sub>
H<sub>3</sub> or T). Protium (<sub>1</sub>
H<sub>1</sub>) is the predominant form
(99.985 %) and it is the only isotope that
does not contain a neutron.

![](/books/chemistry/part-1/Hydrogen/pic2.png)

Deuterium, also known as heavy
hydrogen, constitutes about 0.015 %. Th e
third isotope, tritium is a radioactive isotope
of hydrogen which occurs only in traces
(~1 atom per 10<sup>18</sup> hydrogen atoms). Due
to the existence of these isotopes naturally
occurring hydrogen exists as H<sub>2</sub>
, HD, D<sub>2</sub>, HT, T<sub>2</sub>, and DT. Th e properties of these
isotopes are shown in Table 4.1.

#### 4.1.3 Ortho and Para−Hydrogen:

In the hydrogen atom, the nucleus has a spin. When molecular hydrogen is formed,
the spins of two hydrogen nuclei can be in the same direction or in the opposite direction
as shown in the figure. These two forms of hydrogen molecules are called ortho and para
hydrogens respectively.


![](/books/chemistry/part-1/Hydrogen/pic3.png)

At room temperature, normal hydrogen consists of about 75% ortho-form and 25% para-
form. As the ortho-form is more stable than para-form, the conversion of one isomer into the

other is a slow process. However, the equilibrium shifts in favour of para hydrogen when the
temperature is lowered. The para-form can be catalytically transformed into ortho-form using
platinum or iron. Alternatively, it can also be converted by passing an electric discharge, heating
above 800° C and mixing with paramagnetic molecules such as O<sub>2</sub>
, NO, NO<sub>2</sub> or with nascent/atomic hydrogen.

Ortho and para hydrogen are similar in
chemical properties but differ in some of the
physical properties. For example, the melting
point of para hydrogen is 13.83 K while that
of ortho hydrogen 13.95 K; boiling point of
para hydrogen is 20.26 K while that of ortho
hydrogen 20.39 K. Since the nuclear spins are
in opposite directions the magnetic moment
of para hydrogen is zero and ortho hydrogen
has magnetic moment twice that of a proton.

#### 4.2 Preparation of Hydrogen

High purity hydrogen (>99.9 %) is obtained
by the electrolysis of water containing
traces of acid or alkali or the electrolysis of
aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide or
potassium hydroxide using a nickel anode
and iron cathode. However, this process is
not economical for large-scale production.

At anode : 2 OH- → H<sub>2</sub> O + 1⁄2 O<sub>2</sub> + 2e<sup>-</sup>

At cathode : 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + 2 e<sup>-</sup> → 2 OH<sup>-</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>

Overall reaction : H<sub>2</sub> O → H<sub>2</sub>  + 1⁄2 O<sub>2</sub>

#### 4.2.1 Laboratory Preparation

Hydrogen is conveniently prepared in
laboratory by the reaction of metals, such as
zinc, iron, tin with dilute acid.

![Figure 4.2 Laboratory preparation of hydrogen](/books/chemistry/part-1/Hydrogen/pic4.png)


#### 4.2.2 Industrial Production

In the large-scale, hydrogen is produced
by steam-reforming of hydrocarbons. In
this method hydrocarbon such as methane
is mixed with steam and passed over nickel
catalyst in the range 800-900 °C and 35 atm
pressures.
                                       <br>
<code>CH<sub>4</sub> +H<sub>2</sub>O ------> CO + 3H<sub>2</sub></code>

In an another process, steam is passed
over a red-hot coke to produce carbon
monoxide and hydrogen. The mixture
of gases produced in this way is known as
<i>water gas</i> (CO+H<sub>2</sub>).  This is also called <i>syngas
(Synthetic gas)</i> as it is used in the synthesis
of organic compounds such as methanol
and simple hydrocarbons.

#### Conversion of Carbon monoxide in water gas to Carbon dioxide:

The carbon monoxide of the water
gas can be converted to carbon dioxide by
mixing the gas mixture with more steam
at 400°C and passed over a shift converter
containing iron/copper catalyst. This
reaction is called as <i>water-gas shift reaction.</i>

CO + H<sub>2</sub> O → CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>

The CO2
formed in the above process
is absorbed in a solution of potassium
carbonate.

CO<sub>2</sub> + K<sub>2</sub> CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O → 2 KHCO<sub>3</sub>


#### 4.2.3 Preparation of Deuterium:

##### Electrolysis of heavy water:

Normal water contains 1.6 x 10-4
percentage of heavy water. The dissociation
of protium water (H2

O) is more than heavy

water (D2

O). Therefore, when water is
electrolysed, hydrogen is liberated much
faster than D<sub>2</sub>. The electrolysis is continued
until the resulting solution becomes
enriched in heavy water. Further electrolysis
of the heavy water gives deuterium.

<code> 2D<sub>2</sub>O  ---Electrolysis--->  2D<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub></code>

#### 4.2.4 Preparation of Tritium:

As explained earlier the tritium is
present only in trace amounts. So it can be
artificially prepared by bombarding lithium
with slow neutrons in a nuclear fission
reactor. The nuclear transmutation reaction
for this process is as follows.

#### 4.3 Properties of Hydrogen

**4.3.1 Physical Properties:**

Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless,
tasteless, lightest and highly flammable
gas. It is a non-polar diatomic molecule.
It can be liquefied under low temperature
and high pressure. Hydrogen is a good
reducing agent. Various physical co

nstants
of hydrogen molecule are listed in Table 4.1.

**4.3.2 Chemical Properties:**

Hydrogen reacts with oxygen to give
water. This is an explosive reaction and
releases lot of energy. This is used in fuel
cells to generate electricity.

2 H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2 H<sub>2</sub>O


   <div> Similarly, hydrogen also reacts with halogens
to give corresponding halides. Reaction
with fluorine takes place even in dark with
explosive violence while with chlorine at
room temperature under light. It combines
with bromine on heating and reaction with
iodine is a photochemical reaction.</div>

H<sub>2</sub> + X<sub>2</sub> → 2 HX (X = F, Cl, Br & I)

In the above reactions the hydrogen
has an oxidation state of +1. It also has
a tendency to react with reactive metals
such as lithium, sodium and calcium to
give corresponding hydrides in which the
oxidation state of hydrogen is -1.

2 Li + H<sub>2</sub> → 2 LiH

2 Na + H<sub>2</sub> → 2 NaH

These hydrides are used as reducing
agents in synthetic organic chemistry. It is
used to prepare other important hydrides
such as lithium aluminium hydride and
sodium boro hydride.

**4.3.3 Chemical properties of Deuterium**

Like hydrogen, deuterium also reacts
with oxygen to form deuterium oxide called
heavy water. It also reacts with halogen to
give corresponding halides.

2 D<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2 D<sub>2</sub>O

D<sub>2</sub> + X<sub>2</sub>  → 2 DX

(X = F, Cl, Br & I)

#### Deuterium exchange reactions:

Deuterium can replace reversibly
hydrogen in compounds either partially or
completely depending upon the reaction
conditions. These reactions occur in the
presence of deuterium or heavy water.

CH<sub>4</sub> + 2 D<sub>2</sub> → CD<sub>4</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>

2 NH<sub>3</sub> + 3 D<sub>2</sub> →2 ND<sub>3</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>

#### 4.3.4 Properties of Tritium

It is a β-emitter with a half-life
period of 12.3 years .

#### 4.4 Uses of Hydrogen


1. Over 90 % hydrogen produced
in industry is used for synthetic
applications. One such process is Haber
process which is used to synthesis
ammonia in large scales. Ammonia is
used for the manufacture of chemicals
such as nitric acid, fertilizers and
explosives.

2. Unsaturated fatty oils can be converted
into saturated fats called Vanaspati
(margarine) by the reduction reaction
with Pt/H<sub>2</sub>

3. It can be used to manufacture the
industrial solvent, methanol from
carbon monoxide using copper as
catalyst.

4. In metallurgy, hydrogen can be used to
reduce many metal oxides to metals at
high temperatures.

CuO+ H<sub>2</sub> → Cu + H<sub>2</sub>O 

WO<sub>3</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub> → W+ 3 H<sub>2</sub>O

5. Atomic hydrogen and oxy-hydrogen
torches are used for cutting and
welding.

6. Liquid hydrogen is used as a rocket
fuel.

7. Hydrogen is also used in fuel cells
for generating electrical energy. The
reversible uptake of hydrogen in metals
is also attractive for rechargeable metal
hydride battery.

#### 4.5 Compounds of Hydrogen

##### 4.5.1 Water

Water is one of the most abundant
compounds of hydrogen and our earth’s
surface contains approximately 70 % of
ocean which is the major source of water.
However, sea water contains many dissolved
salts hence it can not be used directly. Water
is essential for all living things and our body
contains about 65% water.


![](/books/chemistry/part-1/Hydrogen/pic6.png)

{{< box title=" Do You Know"="objective" >}} 


**Ortho-H<sub>2</sub>O and Para-H<sub>2</sub>O**

Water exists in the
interstellar clouds and icy satellites
of the solar system. In particular, the
ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) of water in
space has recently received attention.
Like hydrogen, water can also be
classified into ortho-H<sub>2</sub>O, in which
the spin directions of the nuclei of
the hydrogen atoms are parallel, and
para-H<sub>2</sub>O, in which the directions
are antiparallel. OPR of H<sub>2</sub> (300K) on
earth should be 3:1. OPR of H2
O(50K)
in interstellar clouds and comets
should be 2:5:1.

{{< /box >}}

**4.5.2 Physical Properties:**

Water is a colourless and volatile
liquid. The peculiar properties of water
in the condensed phases are due to the
presence of inter molecular hydrogen
bonding between water molecules.
Hydrogen bonding is responsible for the
high melting and boiling points of water.
Some of the physical parameters of water
are listed in Table 4.2.

![](/books/chemistry/part-1/Hydrogen/pic7.png)

†
Unless otherwise stated, all data are at 298 K.


**4.5.3 Chemical Properties:**

Water reacts with metals, non-metals and other compounds differently. The most
reactive metals are the alkali metals. They decompose water even in cold with the evolution of
hydrogen leaving an alkali solution.

2Na + 2 H<sub></sub>2 O → 2 NaOH + H<sub>2</sub>

The group 2 metals (except beryllium) react in a similar way but less violently. The
hydroxides are less soluble than those of Group 1.

Ba + 2H<sub>2</sub>O → Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>

Some transition metals react with hot water or steam to form the corresponding oxides.
For example, steam passed over red hot iron results in the formation of iron oxide with the
release of hydrogen.

3Fe + 4H<sub>2</sub>O → Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>+ 4H<sub>2</sub>

Lead and copper decompose water only at a white heat. Silver, gold, mercury and
platinum do not have any effect on water. In the elemental form, the non-metals such as
carbon, sulphur and phosphorus normally do not react with water. However, as we have seen
earlier, carbon will react with steam when it is red (or white) hot to give <i>water gas.</i>

On the other hand, the halogens react
with water to give an acidic solution. For
example, chlorine forms hydrochloric acid
and hypo chlorous acid. It is responsible for
the antibacterial action of chlorine water,
and for its use as bleach.

Cl<sub>2</sub>+ H<sub>2</sub>O→ HCl + HOCl

Fluorine reacts diff erently to liberate
oxygen from water.

2F<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O → 4HF + O<sub>2</sub>

In a similar way, compounds of non-
metals react with water to give acidic or
alkaline solutions. For example, solutions
of carbonates are slightly alkaline.

CO<sub>3</sub><sup>-2</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O → HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> + OH<sup>-</sup>

Water is an amphoteric oxide. It has
the ability to accept as well as donate protons
and hence it can act as an acid or a base. For
example, in the reaction with HCl it accepts
proton where as in the reaction with weak
base ammonia it donates proton.

NH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O → NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> + OH<suP>-</suP>

HCl + H<sub>2</sub>O → H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>-</sup>

Water dissolves ionic compounds. In
addition, it also hydrolyses some covalent
compounds.

SiCl<sub>4</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O → SiO<sub>2</sub> + 4 HCl


P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub> + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O → 4 H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>

Many salts crystallized from aqueous
solutions form hydrated crystals. Th e water
in the hydrated salts may form co-ordinate
bond or just present in interstitial positions
of crystals.

Examples: [Cr(H<sub>6</sub>O)6]Cl<sub>3</sub> – All six water molecules form co-ordinate bond

BaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O – Both the water molecules are present in interstitial
positions.

CuSO<sub>4</sub> .5H<sub>2</sub>O – In this compound
four water molecules form co-ordinate
bonds while the fi ft h water molecule,
present outside the co-ordination, can form
intermolecular hydrogen bond with another
molecule. 

[Cu(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>]SO<sub>4</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O

#### 4.5.4 Hard and Soft Water:

Hard water contains high amounts of
mineral ions. Th e most common ions found
in hard water are the soluble metal cations
such as magnesium & calcium, though iron,
aluminium, and manganese may also be
found in certain areas. Presence of these
metal salts in the form of bicarbonate,
chloride and sulphate in water makes water
‘hard’. When hard water is boiled carbonates
of magnesium and calcium present in it gets
precipitated. On the other hand, water free
from soluble salts of calcium and magnesium
is called soft water. The hardness of water is
of two types, viz., temporary hardness and
permanent hardness.

#### Temporary Hardness and its removal:

Temporary hardness is primarily
due to the presence of soluble bicarbonates
of magnesium and calcium. This can be
removed by boiling the hard water followed
by filtration. Upon boiling, these salts
decompose into insoluble carbonate which
leads to their precipitation. The magnesium
carbonate thus formed further hydrolysed
to give insoluble magnesium hydroxide.

Ca(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> → CaCO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub>O

Mg(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> → MgCO<sub>3</sub>+ H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub>

MgCO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O → Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>

The resulting precipitates can be
removed by filtration.

Alternatively, we can use Clark’s
method in which, calculated amount of
lime is added to hard water containing the
magnesium and calcium, and the resulting
carbonates and hydroxides can be filtered-
off.

Ca(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + Ca(OH )<sub>2</sub> → 2CaCO<sub>3</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O

  Mg (HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2 Ca(OH )<sub>2</sub>

  2CaCO<sub>3</sub> + Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> +2 H<sub>2</sub>O

#####  Permanent Hardness:

Permanent hardness of water is due
to the presence of soluble salts of magnesium
and calcium in the form of chlorides and
sulphates in it. It can be removed by adding
washing soda, which reacts with these metal
(M = Ca or Mg) chlorides and sulphates in
hard water to form insoluble carbonates.

MCl<sub>2</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> → MCO<sub>3</sub> + 2 NaCl

MSO<sub>4</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> → MCO<sub>3</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>4</sub>

In another way to soften the hard

water is by using a process called ion-
exchange. That is, hardness can be removed

by passing through an ion-exchange bed

like zeolites or column containing ion-
exchange resin. Zeolites are hydrated

sodium alumino-silicates with a general
formula, Na<sub>2</sub>O∙Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>∙xSiO<sub>2</sub>∙yH<sub>2</sub>O<br>
(x = 2 to10, y = 2 to 6). Zeolites have porous structure
in which the monovalent sodium ions are
loosely held and can be exchanged with
hardness producing metal ions (M = Ca<sup>2+</sup> or
Mg<sup>2+</sup>) in water. The complex structure can
conveniently be represented as Na<sub>2</sub>
-Z with sodium as exchangeable cations.


Na<sub>2</sub> -Z + M<sub>2</sub>+ → M-Z + 2 Na<sup>+</sup>

When exhausted, the materials can be
regenerated by treating with aqueous
sodium chloride. The metal ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>
and Mg<sup>2+</sup>) caught in the zeolite (or resin)
are released and they get replenished with
sodium ions.

M-Z + 2NaCl → Na<sub>2</sub>-Z + MCl<sub>2</sub>


![](/books/chemistry/part-1/Hydrogen/pic9.png)

##### 4.6 Heavy Water:

Heavy water (D<sub>2</sub>O) is the oxide
of heavy hydrogen. One part of heavy
water is present in 5000 parts of ordinary
water. It is mainly obtained as the product
of electrolysis of water, as D<sub>2</sub>O does not
undergo electrolysis as easily as H<sub>2</sub>O.

{{< box title=**"Hard water produces  less foam with detergents. Do You Know why??**"="objective" >}} 


The cleaning capacity of soap is reduced
when used in hard water. Soaps are
sodium or potassium salts of long chain
fatty acids (e.g., coconut oil). When
soap is added to hard water, the divalent
magnesium and calcium ions present in
hard water react with soap. Th e sodium
salts present in soaps are converted to
their corresponding magnesium and
calcium salts which are precipitated as
scum/precipitate.

M<sup>2+</sup> + 2RCOONa → (RCOO)<sub>2</sub>M + 2Na<sup>+</sup>

M = Ca or Mg

R = C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>35</sub>

{{< /box >}}

#### 4.6.1 Chemical properties of heavy water:

When compounds containing
hydrogen are treated with D2O, hydrogen
undergoes an exchange for deuterium

2NaOH + D<sub>2</sub>O → 2NaOD + HOD

HCl + D<sub>2</sub>O → DCl + HOD

NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + 4D<sub>2</sub>O → ND<sub>4</sub>Cl + 4HOD

These exchange reactions are
useful in determining the number of ionic
hydrogens present in a given compound.

For example, when D2

O is treated with of
hypo-phosphorus acid only one hydrogen
atom is exchanged with deuterium. It
indicates that, it is a monobasic acid.

H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>+ D<sub>2</sub>O → H<sub>2</sub>DPO<sub>2</sub>+ HDO

It is also used to prepare some deuterium
compounds:

Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub>+ 12D<sub>2</sub>O → 4Al(OD)<sub>3</sub>+ 3CD<sub>4</sub>

CaC<sub>2</sub> + 2 D<sub>2</sub>O → Ca(OD)<sub>2</sub>+ C<sub>2</sub>D<sub>2</sub>

Mg<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>N2  + 6D<sub>2</sub>O   →   3Mg(OD)<sub>2</sub> + 2 ND<sub>3</sub>

Ca<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub> + 6D<sub>2</sub>O  →  3Ca(OD)<sub>2</sub> + 2PD<sub>3</sub>

#### 4.6.2 Uses of heavy water:

1. Heavy water is widely used as
moderator in nuclear reactors as
it can lower the energies of fast
neutrons

2. It is commonly used as a tracer to
study organic reaction mechanisms
and mechanism of metabolic
reactions

3. It is also used as a coolant in nuclear
reactors as it absorbs the heat
generated.

#### 4.7 Hydrogen Peroxide:

Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is one
of the most important peroxides. It can be
prepared by treating metal peroxide with
dilute acid.

BaO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> → BaSO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>



Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> → Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>

On an industrial scale, hydrogen
peroxide is now prepared exclusively by
autoxidation of 2-alkyl anthraquinol.

#### 4.7.1 Physical properties:

Pure hydrogen peroxide is almost a
colorless liquid (pale blue), less volatile and
more viscous than water.

A 30 % solution of hydrogen peroxide
is marketed as ‘100-volume’ hydrogen
peroxide indicating that at S.T.P., 100 ml of
oxygen is liberated by 1 ml of this solution
on heating.


#### 4.7.2 Chemical properties:

Hydrogen peroxide is highly unstable
and the aqueous solution spontaneously
disproportionates to give oxygen and
water. The reaction is, however, slow but
is explosive when catalyzed by metal. If it
is stored in glass container, it dissolves the
alkali metals from the glass, which catalyzes
the disproportionation reaction. For this
reason, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
solutions are stored in plastic bottles.

H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> → H<sub>2</sub>O +  1⁄2 O<sub>2</sub>

Hydrogen peroxide can act both as
an oxidizing agent and a reducing agent.
Oxidation is usually performed in acidic
medium while the reduction reactions are
performed in basic medium

**In acidic conditions:**

H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+ 2 H<sup>+</sup> +2 e<sup>-</sup> → 2 H<sub>2</sub>O (E0
= + 1.77 V)


For example

2FeSO<sub>4</sub>O + +H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> → Fe<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O

In basic conditions:

HO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> + OH<sup>-</sup> → O<sub>2</sub>+ H<sub>2</sub>O + 2 e<sup>-</sup>

(E<sup>0</sup>= + 0.08 V)

For Example,

2KMnO<sub>4</sub>(aq)+ 3H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (aq)

2MnO<sub>4</sub> + 2 KOH + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O +3O<sub>2</sub> (g)

#### 4.7.3 Uses of hydrogen peroxide:

The oxidizing ability of hydrogen
peroxide and the harmless nature of its
products, i.e., water and oxygen, lead to
its many applications. It is used in water
treatment to oxidize pollutants, as a mild
antiseptic, and as bleach in textile, paper
and hair-care industry.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to restore
the white colour of the old paintings which
was lost due to the reaction of hydrogen
sulphide in air with the white pigment
Pb<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>
to form black colored lead
sulphide. Hydrogen peroxide oxidises black
coloured lead sulphide to white coloured
lead sulphate, there by restoring the colour.

PbS + 4H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> → PbSO<sub>4</sub> + 4 H<sub>2</sub>O

#### 4.7.4 Structure of hydrogen peroxide:

Both in gas-phase and solid-phase,
the molecule adopts a skew conformation
due to repulsive interaction of the OH bonds
with lone-pairs of electrons on each oxygen
atom. Indeed, it is the smallest molecule
known to show hindered rotation about a
single bond.

![](/books/chemistry/part-1/Hydrogen/pic11.png)


H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has a non-planar structure.
The molecular dimensions in the gas phase
and solid phase differ as shown in figure
4.5. Structurally, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is represented by the
dihydroxyl formula in which the two OH-
groups do not lie in the same plane. One
way of explaining the shape of hydrogen
peroxide is that the hydrogen atoms would
lie on the pages of a partly opened book,
and the oxygen atoms along the spine. In the
solid phase of molecule, the dihedral angle
reduces to 90.2<sup>o</sup>
due to hydrogen bonding
and the O-O-H angle expands from 94.8<sup>o</sup>
to 101.9<sup>o</sup>

#### 4.8 Hydrides

Hydrogen forms binary hydrides with
many electropositive elements including
metals and non-metals. It also forms ternary
hydrides with two metals. E.g., LiBH<sub>4</sub>
and LiAlH<sub>4</sub>
. The hydrides are classified as ionic,
covalent and metallic hydrides according
to the nature of bonding. Hydrides formed
with elements having lower electronegativity
than hydrogen are often ionic, whereas with
elements having higher electronegativity
than hydrogen form covalent hydrides.

Ionic (Saline) hydrides: These are
hydrides composed of an electropositive
metal, generally, an alkali or alkaline-earth
metal, except beryllium and magnesium,
formed by transfer of electrons from metal
to hydrogen atoms. They can be prepared
by the reaction of elements at about 400°
C. These are salt-like, high-melting, white
crystalline solids having hydride ions (H<sup>-</sup>)
and metal cations (Mn<sup>+</sup>).

2 Li + H<sub>2</sub> → 2 LiH

2 Ca + 2H<sub>2</sub> → 2 CaH<sub>2</sub>

**Covalent (Molecular) hydrides:**

They are compounds in which hydrogen
is attached to another element by sharing
of electrons. The most common examples
of covalent hydrides of non-metals are
methane, ammonia, water and hydrogen
chloride. Covalent hydrides are further
divided into three categories, viz., electron
precise (CH<sub>4</sub> , C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> ,SiH<sub>4</sub>, GeH<sub>4</sub>), electron-
deficient (B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) and electron-rich hydrides
(NH<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O). Since most of the covalent
hydrides consist of discrete, small molecules
that have relatively weak intermolecular
forces, they are generally gases or volatile
liquids.


**Metallic (Interstitial) hydrides:**

Metallic hydrides are usually obtained by
hydrogenation of metals and alloys in which
hydrogen occupies the interstitial sites
(voids). Hence, they are called interstitial
hydrides; the hydrides show properties
similar to parent metals and hence they
are also known as metallic hydrides. Most
of the hydrides are non-stoichiometric
with variable composition (TiH1.5-1.8 and
PdH0.6-0.8), some are relatively light,
inexpensive and thermally unstable which
make them useful for hydrogen storage
applications. Electropositive metals and
some other metals form hydrides with the
stoichiometry MH or sometimes MH2
(M = Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Zn).

**4.9 Hydrogen Bonding**

Hydrogen bonding is one of the most
important natural phenomena occurring
in chemical and biological sciences.
These interactions play a major role in the
structure of proteins and DNA. When a
hydrogen atom (H) is covalently bonded
to a highly electronegative atom such as
fluorine (F) or oxygen (O) or nitrogen (N),
the bond is polarized. Due to this effect, the
polarized hydrogen atom is able to form a
weak electrostatic interaction with another
electronegative atom present in the vicinity.
This interaction is called as a hydrogen bond
(20-50 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) and is denoted by dotted
lines (...).

It is weaker than covalent bond (>
100 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) but stronger than the van der
Waals interaction (< 20 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>). Hydrogen
bond has profound effect on various physical
properties including vapour pressure (H<sub>2</sub>O
and H<sub>2</sub>S), boiling point, miscibility of
liquids (H<sub>2</sub>O and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>
OH), surface tension,
densities, viscosity, heat of vaporization and
fusion, etc. Hydrogen bonds can occur
within a molecule (<i>intramolecular hydrogen
bonding</i>) and between two molecules of the
same type or different type (<i>intermolecular
hydrogen bonding)</i>.

**Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond**

Intramolecular hydrogen bonds are
those which occur within a single molecule.

![](/books/chemistry/part-1/Hydrogen/pic12.png)


**Intermolecular hydrogen bond**

Intermolecular hydrogen bonds occur
between two separate molecules. They can
occur between any numbers of like or unlike
molecules as long as hydrogen donors and
acceptors are present in positions which
enable the hydrogen bonding interactions. For
example, intermolecular hydrogen bonds can
occur between ammonia molecule themselves
or between water molecules themselves or
between ammonia and water.

Water molecules form strong
hydrogen bonds with one another. For
example, each water molecule is linked to
four others through hydrogen bonds. The
shorter distances (100 pm) correspond to
covalent bonds (solid lines), and the longer
distances (180 pm) correspond to hydrogen
bonds (dotted lines).

In ice, each atom is surrounded
tetrahedrally by four water molecules through
hydrogen bonds. That is, the presence of two
hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs of electron
on oxygen atoms in each water molecule allows
formation of a three-dimensional structure.
This arrangement creates an open structure,
which accounts for the lower density of ice
compared with water at 0°C. While in liquid
water, unlike ice where hydrogen bonding
occurs over a long-range, the strong hydrogen
bonding prevails only in a short range and
therefore the denser packing.

![Figure 4.7 (b) Hydrogen bonding in water](/books/chemistry/part-1/Hydrogen/pic14.png)

Hydrogen bond occurs not only in simple molecules but also in complex biomolecules
such as proteins, and they are crucial for biological processes. For example, hydrogen bonds
play an important role in the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), since they hold
together the two helical nucleic acid chains (strands).

#### SUMMARY

Hydrogen is the simplest atom which
contains one electron and one proton. It has
three isotopes namely protium, deuterium
and tritium. The hydrogen exists as diatomic
gaseous molecule. The molecule has two

nuclear spin isomers namely ortho and para-
hydrogen. Elemental hydrogen having an
electronic configuration of 1s<sup>1</sup>
, has properties similar to alkali metals as well as halogens.
Based on its electronic configuration and
existence of the +1 oxidation state in most of
the compounds it is placed in group 1 along
with alkali metals.


Hydrogen is prepared by the action
of metal with mineral acids in laboratory. In
industrial scale, hydrogen is produced by the
steam-reforming of hydrocarbons. Deuterium
can be synthesized by the electrolysis of
heavy water, while the radioactive tritium
is prepared by the nuclear transmutation
reaction of lithium with slow neutrons.


Hydrogen reacts with nonmetals
like oxygen and halogens to form water and
hydrogen halides respectively. It reacts with
metals to form metal hydrides. It acts as
good reducing agent. Deuterium undergoes
exchange reactions with hydrogen. Tritium
with a half-life period of 12.3 years and emits
β-particles spontaneously. Hydrogen has
many uses including in the preparation of
ammonia, methanol, and hydrogenation of
oils and reduction of metal oxides. It can also
be used as fuel.


Water is an important amphoteric
oxide of hydrogen and used a universal
solvent. It hydrolyses oxides and forms metal
hydroxides with metals such as sodium and
barium. Due to the presence of soluble salts
of calcium and magnesium in water, the
water shows hardness. Clark's method can
be used to remove temporary hardness. Like
water, another important oxide is hydrogen
peroxide. It is used as a mild antiseptic and
as a bleaching agent in textile and paper
industries. Hydrogen bound to strong
electronegative atoms such as fluorine,
nitrogen or oxygen atoms, forms a peculiar
type of electrostatic interactions with another
strong electronegative atom. This is called
hydrogen bond. This is one of important
interactions observed in many biological
molecules such as proteins, DNA etc...
