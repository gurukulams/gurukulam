#### 4.1 Introduction

Hydrogen is the simplest atom which
contains one electron and one proton. In
contrast to other elements (except helium)
its valence electron is directly in the sphere of
action of the nucleus. It is invariably present
in most of the compounds we come across
in our daily life such as water, carbohydrate,
proteins etc. As it has an unpaired electron, it
is reactive and exists as a diatomic molecule
(H<sub>2</sub>). However, the abundance of hydrogen
gas in the earth’s atmosphere is very small.

#### 4.1.1 Position in Periodic Table

Th e hydrogen has the electronic
confi guration of 1s1 which resembles with
ns1
general valence shell confi guration of
alkali metals and shows similarity with them
as follows:

1. It forms unipositive ion (H+) like alkali
metals (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup>)

2. It forms halides (HX), oxides (H<sub>2</sub>O),peroxides (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and sulphides (H<sub>2</sub>S) like alkali metals (NaX, Na<sub>2</sub>O, Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,Na<sub>2</sub>S)

3. It also acts as a reducing agent.

However, unlike alkali metals which
have ionization energy ranging from 377 to
520 kJ mol-1, the hydrogen has 1,314 KJ mol<sup>-1</sup>
which is much higher than alkali metals.

Like the formation of halides (X-)
from halogens, hydrogen also has a tendency
to gain one electron to form hydride ion
(H-) whose electronic confi guration is
similar to the noble gas, helium. However,
the electron affi nity of hydrogen is much
less than that of halogen atoms. Hence, the
tendency of hydrogen to form hydride ion
is low compared to that of halogens to form
the halide ions as evident from the following
reactions:

<code> 1⁄2 H<sub>2</sub> + e- → H<sup>-</sup>

ΔH = + 36 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup></code>

<code> 1⁄2 Br<sub>2</sub>  + e- → Br-

ΔH = - 55 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> </code>

Since, hydrogen has similarities
with alkali metals as well as the halogens;
it is diffi cult to fi nd the right position in
the periodic table. However, in most of its
compounds hydrogen exists in +1 oxidation
state. Th erefore, it is reasonable to place
the hydrogen in group 1 along with alkali
metals as shown in the latest periodic table
published by IUPAC.

#### 4.1.2 Isotopes of Hydrogen

Hydrogen has three naturally
occurring isotopes, viz., protium (1
H<sub>1</sub>or H), deuterium (<sub>1</sub>
H<sub>1</sub>or D) and tritium (<sub>1</sub>
H<sub>3</sub> or T). Protium (<sub>1</sub>
H<sub>1</sub>) is the predominant form
(99.985 %) and it is the only isotope that
does not contain a neutron.

![](/books/chemistry/part-1/Hydrogen/pic2.png)

Deuterium, also known as heavy
hydrogen, constitutes about 0.015 %. Th e
third isotope, tritium is a radioactive isotope
of hydrogen which occurs only in traces
(~1 atom per 10<sup>18</sup> hydrogen atoms). Due
to the existence of these isotopes naturally
occurring hydrogen exists as H<sub>2</sub>
, HD, D<sub>2</sub>, HT, T<sub>2</sub>, and DT. Th e properties of these
isotopes are shown in Table 4.1.

#### 4.1.3 Ortho and Para−Hydrogen:

In the hydrogen atom, the nucleus has a spin. When molecular hydrogen is formed,
the spins of two hydrogen nuclei can be in the same direction or in the opposite direction
as shown in the figure. These two forms of hydrogen molecules are called ortho and para
hydrogens respectively.


![](/books/chemistry/part-1/Hydrogen/pic3.png)

At room temperature, normal hydrogen consists of about 75% ortho-form and 25% para-
form. As the ortho-form is more stable than para-form, the conversion of one isomer into the

other is a slow process. However, the equilibrium shifts in favour of para hydrogen when the
temperature is lowered. The para-form can be catalytically transformed into ortho-form using
platinum or iron. Alternatively, it can also be converted by passing an electric discharge, heating
above 800° C and mixing with paramagnetic molecules such as O<sub>2</sub>
, NO, NO<sub>2</sub> or with nascent/atomic hydrogen.

Ortho and para hydrogen are similar in
chemical properties but differ in some of the
physical properties. For example, the melting
point of para hydrogen is 13.83 K while that
of ortho hydrogen 13.95 K; boiling point of
para hydrogen is 20.26 K while that of ortho
hydrogen 20.39 K. Since the nuclear spins are
in opposite directions the magnetic moment
of para hydrogen is zero and ortho hydrogen
has magnetic moment twice that of a proton.

#### 4.2 Preparation of Hydrogen

High purity hydrogen (>99.9 %) is obtained
by the electrolysis of water containing
traces of acid or alkali or the electrolysis of
aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide or
potassium hydroxide using a nickel anode
and iron cathode. However, this process is
not economical for large-scale production.

At anode : 2 OH- → H<sub>2</sub> O + 1⁄2 O<sub>2</sub> + 2e<sup>-</sup>

At cathode : 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + 2 e<sup>-</sup> → 2 OH<sup>-</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>

Overall reaction : H<sub>2</sub> O → H<sub>2</sub>  + 1⁄2 O<sub>2</sub>

#### 4.2.1 Laboratory Preparation

Hydrogen is conveniently prepared in
laboratory by the reaction of metals, such as
zinc, iron, tin with dilute acid.

![Figure 4.2 Laboratory preparation of hydrogen](/books/chemistry/part-1/Hydrogen/pic4.png)


#### 4.2.2 Industrial Production

In the large-scale, hydrogen is produced
by steam-reforming of hydrocarbons. In
this method hydrocarbon such as methane
is mixed with steam and passed over nickel
catalyst in the range 800-900 °C and 35 atm
pressures.
                                       <br>
<code>CH<sub>4</sub> +H<sub>2</sub>O ------> CO + 3H<sub>2</sub></code>

In an another process, steam is passed
over a red-hot coke to produce carbon
monoxide and hydrogen. The mixture
of gases produced in this way is known as
<i>water gas</i> (CO+H<sub>2</sub>).  This is also called <i>syngas
(Synthetic gas)</i> as it is used in the synthesis
of organic compounds such as methanol
and simple hydrocarbons.

#### Conversion of Carbon monoxide in water gas to Carbon dioxide:

The carbon monoxide of the water
gas can be converted to carbon dioxide by
mixing the gas mixture with more steam
at 400°C and passed over a shift converter
containing iron/copper catalyst. This
reaction is called as <i>water-gas shift reaction.</i>

CO + H<sub>2</sub> O → CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>

The CO2
formed in the above process
is absorbed in a solution of potassium
carbonate.

CO<sub>2</sub> + K<sub>2</sub> CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O → 2 KHCO<sub>3</sub>


#### 4.2.3 Preparation of Deuterium:

##### Electrolysis of heavy water:

Normal water contains 1.6 x 10-4
percentage of heavy water. The dissociation
of protium water (H2

O) is more than heavy

water (D2

O). Therefore, when water is
electrolysed, hydrogen is liberated much
faster than D<sub>2</sub>. The electrolysis is continued
until the resulting solution becomes
enriched in heavy water. Further electrolysis
of the heavy water gives deuterium.

<code> 2D<sub>2</sub>O  ---Electrolysis--->  2D<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub></code>

#### 4.2.4 Preparation of Tritium:

As explained earlier the tritium is
present only in trace amounts. So it can be
artificially prepared by bombarding lithium
with slow neutrons in a nuclear fission
reactor. The nuclear transmutation reaction
for this process is as follows.

#### 4.3 Properties of Hydrogen

**4.3.1 Physical Properties:**

Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless,
tasteless, lightest and highly flammable
gas. It is a non-polar diatomic molecule.
It can be liquefied under low temperature
and high pressure. Hydrogen is a good
reducing agent. Various physical co

nstants
of hydrogen molecule are listed in Table 4.1.

**4.3.2 Chemical Properties:**

Hydrogen reacts with oxygen to give
water. This is an explosive reaction and
releases lot of energy. This is used in fuel
cells to generate electricity.

2 H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2 H<sub>2</sub>O


   <div> Similarly, hydrogen also reacts with halogens
to give corresponding halides. Reaction
with fluorine takes place even in dark with
explosive violence while with chlorine at
room temperature under light. It combines
with bromine on heating and reaction with
iodine is a photochemical reaction.</div>

H<sub>2</sub> + X<sub>2</sub> → 2 HX (X = F, Cl, Br & I)

In the above reactions the hydrogen
has an oxidation state of +1. It also has
a tendency to react with reactive metals
such as lithium, sodium and calcium to
give corresponding hydrides in which the
oxidation state of hydrogen is -1.

2 Li + H<sub>2</sub> → 2 LiH

2 Na + H<sub>2</sub> → 2 NaH

These hydrides are used as reducing
agents in synthetic organic chemistry. It is
used to prepare other important hydrides
such as lithium aluminium hydride and
sodium boro hydride.

**4.3.3 Chemical properties of Deuterium**

Like hydrogen, deuterium also reacts
with oxygen to form deuterium oxide called
heavy water. It also reacts with halogen to
give corresponding halides.

2 D<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2 D<sub>2</sub>O

D<sub>2</sub> + X<sub>2</sub>  → 2 DX

(X = F, Cl, Br & I)

#### Deuterium exchange reactions:

Deuterium can replace reversibly
hydrogen in compounds either partially or
completely depending upon the reaction
conditions. These reactions occur in the
presence of deuterium or heavy water.

CH<sub>4</sub> + 2 D<sub>2</sub> → CD<sub>4</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>

2 NH<sub>3</sub> + 3 D<sub>2</sub> →2 ND<sub>3</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>

#### 4.3.4 Properties of Tritium

It is a β-emitter with a half-life
period of 12.3 years .

#### 4.4 Uses of Hydrogen


1. Over 90 % hydrogen produced
in industry is used for synthetic
applications. One such process is Haber
process which is used to synthesis
ammonia in large scales. Ammonia is
used for the manufacture of chemicals
such as nitric acid, fertilizers and
explosives.

2. Unsaturated fatty oils can be converted
into saturated fats called Vanaspati
(margarine) by the reduction reaction
with Pt/H<sub>2</sub>

3. It can be used to manufacture the
industrial solvent, methanol from
carbon monoxide using copper as
catalyst.

4. In metallurgy, hydrogen can be used to
reduce many metal oxides to metals at
high temperatures.

CuO+ H<sub>2</sub> → Cu + H<sub>2</sub>O 

WO<sub>3</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub> → W+ 3 H<sub>2</sub>O

5. Atomic hydrogen and oxy-hydrogen
torches are used for cutting and
welding.

6. Liquid hydrogen is used as a rocket
fuel.

7. Hydrogen is also used in fuel cells
for generating electrical energy. The
reversible uptake of hydrogen in metals
is also attractive for rechargeable metal
hydride battery.
