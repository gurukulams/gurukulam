After studying this unit, students will be able to
• distinguish between the system and surroundings
• define closed, open and isolated systems
• distinguish between state and path functions
• describe the relation between internal energy,
work and heat
• state four laws of thermodynamics
• correlate internal energy change (ΔU) and
enthalpy change (ΔH)and their measurement.
• calculate enthalpy changes for various types of
reactions
• apply Hess’s law to calculate lattice energy of
crystals
• define spontaneous and non spontaneous
processes
• establish the relationship between thermodynamic
state functions enthalpy (H), entropy (S) and
Gibbs free energy (G)
• list the factors that determines spontaneity of the
process
• establish the link between ΔG and spontaneity,
and the relationship
