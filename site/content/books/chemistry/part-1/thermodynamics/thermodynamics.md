### 7.1 Introduction

The term 'Thermodynamics' means
flow of heat and is derived from the Greek
`Thermos' (heat) and `dynamics' (flow),
In our daily life, we come across many
useful reactions such as burning of fuel
to produce heat energy, flow of electrons
through circuit to produce electrical
energy, metabolic reactions to produce the
necessary energy for biological functions
and so on. Thermodynamics, the study of
the transformation of energy, explains all
such processes quantitatively and allows
us to make useful predictions.

In the 19th century, scientists tried
to understand the underlying principles
of steam engine which were already
in operation, in order to improve their
efficiency. The basic problem of the
investigation was the transformation of
heat into mechanical work. However,
over time, the laws of thermodynamics
were developed and helped to understand
the process of steam engine. These laws
have been used to deduce powerful
mathematical relationships applicable to a
broad range of processes.
Thermodynamics evaluates the
macroscopic properties (heat, work) and
their inter relationships. It deals with
properties of systems in equilibrium
and is independent of any theories or
properties of the individual molecules
which constitute the system.

The principles of thermodynamics
are based on three laws of thermodynamics.
The first two laws (First and second law)
summarise the actual experience of inter
conversion of different forms of energy.
The third law deals with the calculation
of entropy and the unattainability of
absolute zero Kelvin. Thermodynamics
carries high practical values but bears
certain limitations. It is independent
of atomic and molecular structure and
reaction mechanism. The laws can be
used to predict whether a particular
reaction is feasible or not under a given
set of conditions, but they cannot give the
rate at which the reaction takes place. In
other words, thermodynamics deals with
equilibrium conditions quantitatively,
but does not take into account the kinetic
approach to the equilibrium state.

### 7.2 System and Surrounding

Before studying the laws of
thermodynamics and their applications,
it is important to understand the meaning
of a few terms used frequently in
thermodynamics.

The universe is divided into two
parts, the system and its surroundings.
The system is the part of universe which
is under thermodynamic consideration. It
is separated from the rest of the universe
by real or imaginary boundaries.

![Figure 7.1 System, surrounding & boundary Homogeneous and
heterogeneous systems](/books/chemistry/part-1/thermodynamics/pic1.png)

**Example:**

The system may be water in a
beaker, a balloon filled with air, an aqueous
solution of glucose etc.

On the basis of physical and
chemical properties, systems can be
divided into two types.

A system is called homogeneous
if the physical state of all its constituents
are the same. Example: a mixture of gases,
completely miscible mixture of liquids etc.

A system is called heterogeneous, if
physical state of all its constituents is not
the same.
Example: mixture of oil and water

**Surrounding:**

Everything in the universe that
is not the part of the system is called
surroundings.

**Boundary:**
Anything which separates the
system from its surrounding is called
boundary.

**7.2.1 Types of systems:**

There are three types of
thermodynamic systems depending on
the nature of the boundary.

![Figure 7.2Types of Systems](/books/chemistry/part-1/thermodynamics/pic2.png)

**Isolated system:**


A system which can exchange
neither matter nor energy with its
surroundings is called an isolated system.
Here boundary is sealed and insulated.
Hot water contained in a thermos flask, is
an example for an isolated system. In this
isolated system both energy (heat) and
matter (water vapour) neither enter nor
leave the system.

**Closed system:**

A system which can exchange
only energy but not matter with its
surroundings is called a closed system.
Here the boundary is sealed but not
insulated. Hot water contained in a closed
beaker is an example for a closed system.
In this system energy (heat) is transferred
to the surroundings but no matter (water
vapour) can escape from this system. A
gas contained in a cylinder fitted with a
piston constitutes a closed system.

**Open system:**

A System which can exchange both
matter and energy with its surrounding is
called an open system. Hot water contained
in an open beaker is an example for open
system. In this system both matter (water
vapour) and energy (heat) is transferred
to the surrounding.
All living things and chemical
reactions are open systems because they
exchange matter and energy with the
surroundings.

### 7.2.2 Properties of the system:

**Intensive and extensive properties**

Some of the properties of a system
depend on its mass or size whereas other
properties do not depend on its mass or
size. Based on this, the properties of a
system are grouped as **extensive** property
and **intensive**property.

**Extensive properties:**

The property that depends on the mass or
the size of the system is called an extensive
property.

**Examples:** Volume, Number of moles,
Mass, Internal energy, etc.,

**Intensive properties:**

The property that is independent of the
mass or the size of the system is called an
intensive property.

**Examples :**Refractive index, Surface
tension, density, temperature, Boiling
point, Freezing point, molar volume, etc.,

### 7.2.3 Thermodynamic processes

The method of operation which
can bring about a change in the system is
called thermodynamic process. Heating,
cooling, expansion, compression, fusion,
vaporization etc., are some examples of a
thermodynamic process.

**Types of processes:**

A thermodynamic process can be
carried out in different ways and under
different conditions. The processes can be
classified as follows:

**Reversible process:**

The process in which the system
and surrounding can be restored to
the initial state from the final state
without producing any changes in the
thermodynamic properties of the universe
is called a reversible process. There are two
important conditions for the reversible
process to occur. Firstly, the process should
occur infinitesimally slowly and secondly
throughout the process, the system and
surroundings must be in equilibrium with
each other.

**Irreversible Process:**

The process in which the system
and surrounding cannot be restored to the
initial state from the final state is called
an irreversible process. All the processes
occurring in nature are irreversible
processes. During the irreversible process
the system and surroundings are not in
equilibrium with each other.

**Adiabatic process:**

An adiabatic process is defined as
one in which there is no exchange of heat
(q) between the system and surrounding
during the process. Those processes in
which no heat can flow into or out of the
system are called **<i>adiabatic processes**</i>.
This condition is attained by thermally
insulating the system. In an adiabatic
process if work is done by the system its
temperature decreases, if work is done
on the system its temperature increases,
because, the system cannot exchange heat
with its surroundings.


For an adiabatic process q = 0

**Isothermal process :**

An isothermal process is defined as
one in which the temperature of the system
remains constant, during the change
from its initial to final state. The system
exchanges heat with its surrounding and
the temperature of the system remains
constant. For this purpose the experiment
is often performed in a thermostat.
For an isothermal process dT = 0

**Isobaric process**
An isobaric process is defined as
one in which the pressure of the system
remains constant during its change from
the initial to final state.

For an isobaric process dP= 0 .

**Isochoric process**

An isochoric process is defined as
the one in which the volume of system
remains constant during its change from
initial to final state. Combustion of a fuel
in a bomb calorimeter is an example of an
isochoric process.

For an isochoric process, dV= 0.

**Cyclic process:**

When a system returns to its
original state after completing a series
of changes, then it is said that a cycle is
completed. This process is known as a
cyclic process.

For a cyclic process dU = 0, dH = 0, dP=0, dV=0, dT=0

**State functions, path functions:**

**State function**

A thermodynamic system can be defined
by using the variables P, V, T and `n'. A state
function is a thermodynamic property of
a system, which has a specific value for a
given state and does not depend on the
path (or manner) by which the particular
state is reached.

Example : Pressure (P), Volume (V),
Temperature(T), Internal energy (U),
Enthalpy (H), free energy (G) etc.

**Path functions:**

A path function is a thermodynamic
property of the system whose value
depends on the path by which the system
changes from its initial to final states.

**Example: Work (w), Heat (q).**

Work (w) will have different values
if the process is carried out reversibly or
irreversibly.


**Internal Energy (U)**

The internal energy is a
characteristic property of a system which
is denoted by the symbol U. The internal
energy of a system is equal to the energy
possessed by all its constituents namely
atoms, ions and molecules. The total
energy of all molecules in a system is equal
to the sum of their translational energy
(U<sub>t</sub>), vibrational energy (U<sub>v</sub>), rotational
energy (U<sub>r</sub>), bond energy (U<sub>b</sub>), electronic
energy (U<sub>e</sub>) and energy due to molecular
interactions (U<sub>i</sub>).

Thus:
U = U<sub>t</sub> + U<sub>v</sub> + U<sub>r</sub>+U<sub>b</sub> +U<sub>e</sub> + U<sub>i</sub>

The total energy of all the molecules of
the system is called internal energy. In
thermodynamics one is concerned only
with the change in internal energy (ΔU)
rather than the absolute value of energy.


**Importance of Internal energy**

The internal energy possessed by
a substance differentiates its physical
structure. For example, the allotropes of
carbon, namely, graphite (C<sub>graphite</sub>) and
diamond (C<sub>diamond</sub>), differ from each other
because they possess different internal
energies and have different structures.

**Characteristics of internal energy (U):**

* The internal energy of a system is an
extensive property. It depends on the
amount of the substances present in
the system. If the amount is doubled,
the internal energy is also doubled.

* The internal energy of a system is a
state function. It depends only upon
the state variables (T, P, V, n) of the
system. The change in internal energy
does not depend on the path by which
the final state is reached.

* The change in internal energy of a
system is expressed as ΔU= U<sub>f</sub> – U<sub>i</sub>

* In a cyclic process, there is no internal
energy change. ΔU(cyclic) = 0

* If the internal energy of the system
in the final state (U<sub>f</sub>) is less than the
internal energy of the system in its
initial state (U<sub>i</sub>), then ΔU would be
negative.

ΔU=U<sub>f</sub> – U<sub>i</sub>= −ve (U<sub>f</sub> < U<sub>f</sub>)


• If the internal energy of the system
in the final state (U<sub>f</sub>) is greater than
the internal energy of the system in
its initial state (U<sub>i</sub>), then ΔU would be
positive.

ΔU=U<sub>f</sub> − U<sub>i</sub>= +ve (U<sub>f</sub>) > U<sub>i</sub>

The heat (q) is regarded as an energy
in transit across the boundary separating
a system from its surrounding. Heat
changes lead to temperature differences
between system and surrounding. Heat is
a path function.

**Units of heat:**

The SI unit of heat is joule (J).
Heat quantities are generally measured
in calories (cal). A calorie is defined as
the quantity of heat required to raise the
temperature of 1 gram of water by 1° C in
the vicinity of 15° C.

**Sign convention of heat:**

The symbol of heat is q.

If heat flows into the system from
the surrounding, energy of a system
increases. Hence it is taken to be positive
(+q).

If heat flows out of the system into
the surrounding, energy of the system
decreases. Hence, it is taken to be negative
(–q).

**Work(w)**

Work is defined as the force (F) multiplied
by the displacement(x).

−w = F. x –––––––––––(7.1)

The negative sign (−) is introduced
to indicate that the work has been done
by the system by spending a part of its
internal energy.

The work,

(i) is a path function.

(ii) appears only at the boundary of the
system.

(iii) appears during the change in the state
of the system.

(iv) In thermodynamics, surroundings is
so large that macroscopic changes to
surroundings do not happen.

**Units of work:**

The SI unit of work is joule (J),
which is defined as the work done
by a force of one Newton through a
displacement of one meter ( J= Nm). We
often use kilojoule (kJ) for large quantities
of work. 1 kJ = 1000 J.

**Sign convention of work:**

The symbol of work is 'w'.

If work is done by the system, the
energy of the system decreases, hence by
convention, work is taken to be negative
(− w).

If work is done on the system, the
energy of the system increases, hence
by convention, the work is taken to be
positive (+w).

**Pressure - volume work**

In elementary thermodynamics the
only type of work generally considered
is the work done in expansion (or
compression) of a gas. This is known
as pressure-volume work, PV work or
expansion work.

**Work involved in expansion and compression processes:**

In most thermodynamic
calculations we are dealing with the
evaluation of work involved in the
expansion or compression of gases.
The essential condition for expansion
or compression of a system is that there
should be difference between external
pressure (P<sub>ext</sub>) and internal pressure (P<sub>int</sub>).

For understanding pressure-
volume work, let us consider a cylinder
which contains 'n' moles of an ideal gas
fitted with a frictionless piston of cross
sectional area A. The total volume of the
gas inside is V<sub>i</sub> and pressure of the gas
inside is P<sub>int</sub>.


If the external pressure P<sub>ext</sub> is
greater than P<sub>int</sub>, the piston moves inward
till the pressure inside becomes equal to
Pext. Let this change be achieved in a single
step and the final volume be V<sub>f</sub>.

In this case, the work is done on the system
(+w). It can be calculated as follows

w = –F .Δx ------------ (7.2)

where dx is the distance moved by
the piston during the compression and F
is the force acting on the gas.



![Figure 7.3 showing work involved in
compression processes] (/books/chemistry/part-1/thermodynamics/pic3.png)

F = P<sub>ext</sub> A---- (7.3)

             Substituting 7.3 in 7.2

w = – P<sub>ext</sub> . A. Δx    

A.Δx = change in volume = V<sub>f</sub>-V<sub>i</sub>

w = – P<sub>ext</sub> . (V<sub>f</sub>-V<sub>i</sub>) -––––– (7.4)


 w = –P<sub>ext</sub> . (–ΔV) –––––– (7.5)

= P<sub>ext</sub> . ΔV

Since work is done on the system, it
is a positive quantity.
If the pressure is not constant, but
changes during the process such that it
is always infinitesimally greater than the
pressure of the gas, then, at each stage of
compression, the volume decreases by an
infinitesimal amount, dV. In such a case
we can calculate the work done on the gas
by the relation

In a compression process, Pext the
external pressure is always greater than
the pressure of the system.

i.e P<sub>ext</sub> = (P<sub>int</sub> + dP).

In an expansion process, the
external pressure is always less than the
pressure of the system

i.e. P<sub>ext</sub> = (P<sub>int</sub> - dP).

![Figure 7.4](/books/chemistry/part-1/thermodynamics/pic4.png)

When pressure is not constant and changes
in infinitesimally small steps (reversible
conditions) during compression from V<sub>i</sub>
to V<sub>f</sub>
, the P-V plot looks like in fig 7.4
Work done on the gas is represented by
the shaded area.

In general case we can write,

P<sub>ext</sub> = (P<sub>int</sub> + dP). Such processes
are called reversible processes. For a
compression process work can be related
to internal pressure of the system under
reversible conditions by writing equation

For a given system with an ideal gas

P<sub>int</sub> V = <sub>n</sub>RT

P<sub>int</sub> = <sub>n</sub>RT/V

If V<sub>f</sub> > V<sub>i</sub> (expansion), the sign of work
done by the process is negative.

If V<sub>f</sub> < V <sub>i</sub>
(compression) the sign of work
done on the process is positive.

**7.3 Zeroth law of thermodynamics:**

The zeroth law of thermodynamics,
also known as the law of thermal
equilibrium, was put forward much after
the establishment of the first and second
laws of thermodynamics. It is placed
before the first and second laws as it
provides a logical basis for the concept of
temperature of the system.

![Figure : 7.5 Zeroth law of thermodynamics:](/books/chemistry/part-1/thermodynamics/pic5.png)


The law states that `If two systems
are separately in thermal equilibrium with
a third one, then they tend to be in thermal
equilibrium with themselves'.


According to this law, if systems
B and C separately are in thermal
equilibrium with another system A, then
systems B and C will also be in thermal
equilibrium with each other. This is also
the principle by which thermometers are
used.

**7.4 First Law of Thermodynamics:**

The first law of thermodynamics,
known as the law of conservation of
energy, states that the total energy of an
isolated system remains constant though
it may change from one form to another.

When a system moves from state 1
to state 2, its internal energy changes from
U<sub>1</sub> to U<sub>2</sub>. Then change in internal energy


ΔU = U<sub>2</sub> – U<sub>1</sub>.

This internal energy change is
brought about by the either absorption
or evolution of heat and/or by work being
done by/on the system.

Because the total energy of the
system must remain constant, we can
write the mathematical statement of the
First Law as:

ΔU = q + w –––––––––––––––––(7.7)

Where q - the amount of heat supplied to
the system; w - work done on the system
Other statements of first law of
thermodynamics

(1) Whenever an energy of a particular type
disappears, an equivalent amount of
another type must be produced.


(2) The total energy of a system and
surrounding remains constant (or
conserved)


(3) "Energy can neither be created nor
destroyed, but may be converted from
one form to another".


(4) "The change in the internal energy of
a closed system is equal to the energy
that passes through its boundary as
heat or work".


(5) "Heat and work are two ways of
changing a system's internal energy".

### 7.4.1 Mathematical statement of the first law

The mathematical statement of the first
law of thermodynamics is

ΔU = q + w --------- (7.7)

Case 1 : For a cyclic process
involving isothermal expansion of an
ideal gas,

ΔU = 0.

eqn (7.7) ⇒∴ q = -w

In other words, during a cyclic
process, the amount of heat absorbed by
the system is equal to work done by the
system.


Case 2 : For an isochoric process
(no change in volume) there is no work of
expansion. i.e. ΔV = 0


ΔU = q + w

   = q - PΔV

ΔV = 0

ΔU = q<sub>v</sub>

In other words, during an isochoric
process, the amount of heat supplied to the
system is converted to its internal energy.


Case 3 : For an adiabatic process
there is no change in heat. i.e. q= 0. Hence

q = 0
eqn (7.7) ⇒ ΔU = w

In other words, in an adiabatic
process, the decrease in internal energy
is exactly equal to the work done by the
system on its surroundings.


Case 4 : For an isobaric process.
There is no change in the pressure. P
remains constant. Hence

ΔU = q + w

ΔU = q - P ΔV

In other words, in an isobaric
process a part of heat absorbed by the
system is used for P-V expansion work
and the remaining is added to the internal
energy of the system.

**Problem: 7.1**

A gas contained in a cylinder fitted
with a frictionless piston expands against
a constant external pressure of 1 atm from
a volume of 5 litres to a volume of 10 litres.
In doing so it absorbs 400 J of thermal
energy from its surroundings. Determine
the change in internal energy of system.

**Solution:**

Given data q = 400 J V<sub>1</sub>=5L V2 = 10L

Δu = q-w (heat is given to
the system (+q); work is done by the
system(-w)
Δu = q - PdV

   = 400 J - 1 atm (10-5)L

   = 400 J - 5 atm L

[∴1L atm = 101.33 J]

         = 400 J - 5 × 101.33 J

         = 400 J - 506.65 J

         = - 106.65 J

**7.5 Enthalpy (H)**


The enthalpy (H), is a
thermodynamic property of a system, is
defined as the sum of the internal energy
(U) of a system and the product of pressure
and volume of the system. That is,

H = U + PV –––––––––––––––––(7.8)

It reflects the capacity to do
mechanical work and the capacity to
release heat by the system. When a process
occurs at constant pressure, the heat
involved (either released or absorbed) is
equal to the change in enthalpy.
Enthalpy is a state function which
depends entirely on the state functions T,
P and U. Enthalpy is usually expressed as
the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for a process
between initial and final states at constant
pressure.

ΔH = ΔU + PΔV ––––––––––––––––(7.9)

The change in enthalpy (ΔH) is
equal to the heat supplied at the constant
pressure to a system (as long as the system
does no additional work).

ΔH=q<sub>q</sub>

In an endothermic reaction heat
is absorbed by the system from the
surroundings that is q>0 (positive).
Therefore, ΔH is also positive. In an
exothermic reaction heat is evolved by the
system to the surroundings that is, q<0
(negative). If q is negative, then ΔH will
also be negative.


**7.5.1 Relation between enthalpy `H' and internal energy U'**

When the system at constant
pressure undergoes changes from an
initial state with H<sub>1</sub>, U<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>1</sub> to a final
state with H<sub>2</sub>, U<sub>2</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> the change in
enthalpy ΔH, can be calculated as follows:

H = U + PV 

In the initial state

H<sub>1</sub> = U<sub>1</sub> + PV<sub>1</sub>−−−−−(7.10)

In the final state

H<sub>2</sub> = U<sub>2</sub> + PV<sub>2</sub>    −−−−(7.11)

change in enthalpy is (7.11) - (7.10)

(H<sub>2</sub>−H<sub>1</sub>) = (U<sub>2</sub>−U<sub>1</sub>) + P(V<sub>2</sub>−V<sub>1</sub>)


ΔH=ΔU + PΔV --------- (7.12)

As per first law of thermodynamics,

ΔU = q+w

Equation 7.12 becomes

ΔH = q + w + PΔV

w= -PΔV

ΔH = q<sub>p</sub> - PΔV + PΔV

ΔH = q<sub>p</sub>–––––––––– (7.13)

q<sub>p</sub> − is the heat absorbed at constant
pressure and is considered as heat content.
Consider a closed system of gases
which are chemically reacting to form
gaseous products at constant temperature

as the number of moles of gaseous reactants and products,
then,

For reactants (initial state) :

For products (final state) :

### <ins>7.5.2 Enthalpy Changes for Different Types of Reactions and Phase Transitions:</ins>


The heat or enthalpy changes
accompanying chemical reactions is
expressed in different ways depending
on the nature of the reaction. These are
discussed below.

Standard heat of formation
The standard heat of formation of
a compound is defined as “the change in
enthalpy that takes place when one mole of
a compound is formed from its elements,
present in their standard states (298 K
and 1 bar pressure)". By convention the
standard heat of formation of all elements
is assigned a value of zero.


Fe(s)+ S(s) → FeS(s)

ΔH<sub>f</sub>0 = – 100.42 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

2C(s)+H<sub>2</sub>(g)→ C<sub>2</sub>H2<sub>(g)</sub>

ΔH<sub>f</sub> <sup>0</sup>= + 222.33 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

1/2 Cl<sub>2</sub>(g) + 1/2H<sub>2</sub>(g) --> HCl(g)

ΔH<sub>f</sub> 0 = – 92.4 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

The standard heats of formation of
some compounds are given in Table 7.4.

**<ins>Table: 7.4 standard heat of formation of some compunds</ins>**

| **substance**     | **ΔHf<sub>0</sub>(k)mol<sup>-1</sup>** | **substance**                 | **ΔHf<sub>0</sub>(k)mol<sup>-1</sup>** |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| H2<sub>o</sub>(l) | −242                                   | CH<sub>4</sub>(g)             | -74.85                                 |
| HCl(g)            | −92.4                                  | C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>(g) | −84.6                                  |
| HBr(g)            | −36.4                                  | C<sub>6</sub>H<sub></sub>(g)  | +49.6                                  |

| CO2(g)            | -393.5                                 | CH<sub>3</sub>OH
(l)           | −239.2 
                                               |

**<ins>7.6 Thermochemical Equations:**</ins>


A thermochemical equation is
a balanced stoichiometric chemical
equation that includes the enthalpy
change (ΔH). The following conventions
are adopted in thermochemical equations:

(i) The coefficients in a balanced
thermochemical equation refer to
number of moles of reactants and
products involved in the reaction.

(ii) The enthalpy change of the reaction
ΔHr has to be specified with
appropriate sign and unit.

(iii) When the chemical reaction is
reversed, the value of ΔH is reversed
in sign with the same magnitude.

(iv) The physical states (gas, liquid,
aqueous, solid in brackets) of all
species are important and must
be specified in a thermochemical
reaction, since ΔH depends on
the physical state of reactants and
products.

(v) If the thermochemical equation is
multiplied throughout by a number,
the enthalpy change is also multiplied
by the same number.

(vi) The negative sign of ΔHr

indicates
that the reaction is exothermic and
the positive sign of ΔHr
indicates an endothermic reaction.

For example, consider the following
reaction,

2 H<sub>2</sub>(g)+O<sub>2</sub>(g)→2 H<sub>2</sub>O(g)

  ΔH<sub>r</sub>0 =− 967.4 kJ

  2 H<sub>2</sub> O (g) → 2 H<sub>2</sub>(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g)

  ΔH<sub>r</sub>0 = + 967.4 kJ

  Standard enthalpy of reaction (ΔH<sub>r</sub><sup>o</sup>) from standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) <sup>o</sup>

  The standard enthalpy of a reaction
is the enthalpy change for a reactionwhen all the reactants and products are
present in their standard states. Standard
conditions are denoted by adding the
superscript 0 to the symbol (ΔH<sup>o</sup>)

We can calculate the enthalpy of
a reaction under standard conditions
from the values of standard enthalpies
of formation of various reactants and
products. The standard enthalpy of
reaction is equal to the difference between
standard enthalpy of formation of products
and the standard enthalpies of formation
of reactants.

ΔHr<sup>0</sup>= Σ ΔHr<sup>0</sup><sub>(products)</sub>

For a general reaction

aA + bB → cC +dD

ΔHf<sup>0</sup> = Σ ΔHr<sup>0</sup><sub>(products) -  Σ ΔHr<sup>0</sup><sub>(reactants)

ΔHf<sup>0</sup> = { c ΔHf<sup>0</sup>(C) + d ΔHf<sup>0</sup>(D)} –
 {a ΔHf<sup>0</sup>(A) + b ΔHf<sup>0</sup>(B)}

 **<ins>Problem : 7.2</ins>**

 The standard enthalpies of formation of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH(l),CO<sub>2</sub>(g)CO<sub>2</sub>(g) are - 277,-393.5 and -285.5 kJ mol-1 respectively.

Calculate the standard enthalpy change
for the reaction

C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH(l)+3O<sub>2</sub>(g)→2CO<sub>2</sub>(g)+3 H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

The enthalpy of formation of O<sub>2</sub>(g) in the
standard state is Zero, by definition

**<ins>Solution:</ins>**

For example, the standard enthalpy
change for the combustion of ethanol can
be calculated from the standard enthalpies
of formation of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH(l), CO<sub>2</sub>(g)
and H<sub>2</sub>O(l). The enthalpies of formation
are –277, – 393.5 and –285.5 kJ mol–1
respectively.

C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH(l) + 3O<sub>2</sub>(g) → 2CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + 3H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

∆H<sub>r</sub><sup>0</sup>  = {(∆H<sub>r</sub><sup>0</sup><sub>products</sub>)  - 
(∆H<sub>r</sub><sup>0</sup><sub>rectants</sub>) }

∆H<sub>r</sub><sup>0</sup> = -1366.5 J


{{< box title="Evaluate Yourself - 1" type="objective" >}} 

Calculate ∆H<sub>r</sub><sup>0</sup> for the reaction

CO<sub>2</sub>(g)+ H<sub>2</sub>(g) → CO(g)+ H<sub>2</sub>O(g)

given that ∆H<sub>r</sub><sup>0</sup>  for  CO<sub>2</sub>(g), CO(g) and
H<sub>2</sub>O(g) are – 393.5, – 111.31 and – 242
kJ mol–1 respectively.

{{< /box >}}

**<ins>Heat of combustion</ins>**

The heat of combustion of a
substance is defined as “The change in
enthalpy of a system when one mole of the
substance is completely burnt in excess
of air or oxygen”. It is denoted by ΔH<sub>C</sub>.
For example, the heat of combustion of
methane is – 87.78 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>.

CH<sub>4</sub>(g)+ 2O<sub>2</sub>(g)→ CO<sub>2</sub>(g)+ 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

ΔHC = – 87.78 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

For the combustion of carbon,

C (s)+ O<sub>2</sub>(g) → CO<sub>2</sub>(g)

ΔHC = – 394.55 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

Combustion reactions are always
exothermic. Hence the enthalpy change is
always negative.

**<ins>Molar heat capacities</ins>**

When heat (q) is supplied to a system, the
molecules in the system absorb the heat
and hence their kinetic energy increases,
which in turn raises the temperature of the
system from T<sub>1</sub> to T<sub>2</sub>. This increase (T2 - T1)
in temperature is directly proportional to
the amount of heat absorbed and inversely
proportional to mass of the substance. In
other words,

q α mΔT

q = c m ΔT

c = q/m ΔT

The constant c is called heat
capacity.

<!-- Equation coming here-->

when m=1 kg and (T<sub>2</sub> - T<sub>1</sub>) = 1 K
then the heat capacity is referred as specific
heat capacity. The equation 7.18 becomes
c = q

Thus specific heat capacity of a
system is defined as “The heat absorbed
by one kilogram of a substance to raise its
temperature by one Kelvin at a specified
temperature”.

The heat capacity for 1 mole of
substance, is called molar heat capacity
(c<sub>m</sub>). It is defined as “The amount of heat
absorbed by one mole of the substance to
raise its temperature by 1 kelvin”.

**<ins>Units of Heat Capacity:</ins>**

The SI unit of molar heat capacity
is JK<sup>-1</sup>mol<sup>-1</sup>

The molar heat capacities can be
expressed either at constant volume (C<sub>v</sub>)
or at constant pressure (C<sub>p</sub>).

According to the first law of
thermodynamics

U = q + w or U = q - PdV

q = U + PdV ---------------------(7.19)

Differentiate (7.19) with respect to
temperature at constant volume i.e dV=0,

<!-- equation comming here-->

Thus the heat capacity at constant
volume (C<sub>V</sub>) is defined as the rate of
change of internal energy with respect to
temperature at constant volume.
Similarly the molar heat capacity at
constant pressure (C<sub>P</sub>) can be defined as
the rate of change of enthalpy with respect
to temperature at constant pressure.

<!-- equation coming soon-->

**<ins>Relation between Cp and Cv for an ideal gas.</ins>**


From the definition of enthalpy

H=U+PV ------(7.8)

for 1 mole of an ideal gas

PV = nRT -----(7.22)

By substituting (7.22) in (7.8)

H = U + nRT ---- (7.23)

Differentiating the above equation with
respect to T,

At constant pressure processes,
a system has to do work against the
surroundings. Hence, the system would
require more heat to effect a given
temperature rise than at constant volume,
so C<sub>p</sub> is always greater than C<sub>v</sub>

### <ins>Calculation of ΔU and ΔH</ins>

For one mole of an ideal gas, we have

C<sub>v</sub> = dU /dt

For a finite change, we have

ΔU = C<sub>V</sub> ΔT

ΔU= C<sub>V</sub> (T<sub>2</sub> – T<sub>1</sub>)

and for n moles of an ideal gas we get

ΔU = n C<sub>v</sub>(T<sub>2</sub> – T<sub>1</sub>) –––––––––– (7.25)

Similarly for n moles of an ideal gas we get

Δ H = n CP (T<sub>2</sub>-T<sub>1</sub>)–––––– (7.26)

**Problem 7.3**

Calculate the value of ΔU and ΔH
on heating 128.0 g of oxygen from 0o C
to 1000 C. C<sub>V</sub> and C<sub>P</sub> on an average are
21 and 29 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>. (The difference is
8Jmol-1 K-1 which is approximately equal
to R)

**Solution.**

We know

ΔU = n C<sub>v</sub> (T<sub>2</sub>-T<sub>1</sub>)

ΔU = n C<sub>P</sub> (T<sub>2</sub>-T<sub>1</sub>)

Here n =  128 /32 = 4 moles ;

T2 = 100<sup>0</sup> C =373K; T<sub>1</sub> = 00 C = 273K

ΔU = n C<sub>v</sub> (T<sub>2</sub>-T<sub>1</sub>)

ΔU = 4 x 21 x (373 - 273)

ΔU = 8400 J

ΔU = 8.4 KJ

ΔH = n C<sub>p</sub> (T<sub>2</sub>- T<sub>1</sub>)

ΔH = 4 × 29 × (373- 273)

ΔH = 11600 J

ΔH = 11.6 kJ

### <ins>7.7 Measurement of ΔU and ΔH using Calorimetry.</ins><hr>

Calorimeter is used for measuring
the amount of heat change in a chemical
or physical change. In calorimetry, the
temperature change in the process is
measured which is inversely proportional
to the heat change. By using the expression
C = q/mΔT, we can calculate the amount
of heat change in the process. Calorimetric
measurements are made under two
different conditions

i) At constant volume (q<sub>V</sub>)

ii) At constant pressure (q<sub>p</sub>)

**(A) ΔU Measurements**

For chemical reactions, heat
evolved at constant volume, is measured
in a bomb calorimeter.

The inner vessel (the bomb) and its
cover are made of strong steel. The cover
is fitted tightly to the vessel by means of
metal lid and screws.


![Figure 7.6 Bomb calorimeter:](/books/chemistry/part-1/thermodynamics/pic6.png)

A weighed amount of the substance
is taken in a platinum cup connected with
electrical wires for striking an arc instantly
to kindle combustion. The bomb is then
tightly closed and pressurized with excess
oxygen. The bomb is immersed in water,
in the inner volume of the calorimeter.
A stirrer is placed in the space between
the wall of the calorimeter and the bomb,
so that water can be stirred, uniformly.
The reaction is started by striking the
substance through electrical heating.

A known amount of combustible
substance is burnt in oxygen in the
bomb. Heat evolved during the reaction
is absorbed by the calorimeter as well as
the water in which the bomb is immersed.
The change in temperature is measured
using a Beckman thermometer. Since the
bomb is sealed its volume does not change
and hence the heat measurements is equal
to the heat of combustion at a constant
volume (ΔU<sub>c</sub><sup>0</sup>).

The amount of heat produced in
the reaction (ΔU<sub>c</sub><sup>0</sup>) is equal to the sum of
the heat abosrbed by the calorimeter and
water.


Heat absorbed by the calorimeter

q<sub>1</sub> = k.ΔT

where k is a calorimeter constant
equal to m<sub>c</sub>C<sub>c</sub> ( m<sub>c</sub> is mass of the
calorimeter and C<sub>c</sub> is heat capacity of
calorimeter)

Heat absorbed by the water

q<sub>2</sub> = m<sub>w</sub> C<sub>w</sub> ΔT

where m<sub>w</sub> is molar mass of water

C<sub>w</sub> is molar heat capacity of water
(75.29 J K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>).

Therefore ΔU<sub></sub>c = q<sub>1</sub> + q<sub>2</sub>

= k.ΔT + m<sub>w</sub>C<sub>w</sub> ΔT

= (k+m<sub>w</sub> C<sub>w</sub>)ΔT

Calorimeter constant can be determined
by burning a known mass of standard
sample (benzoic acid) for which the heat
of combustion is known (-3227 kJmol<sup>-1</sup>

The enthalpy of combustion at
constant pressure of the substance is
calculated from the equation (7.17)

ΔHC<sup>0</sup>
(pressure) = ΔU<sub>c</sub><sup>0</sup>
(Vol) + Δn<sub>g</sub>RT


**Applications of bomb** **calorimeter:**

1. Bomb calorimeter is used to determine
the amount of heat released in
combustion reaction.

2. It is used to determine the calorific
value of food.

3. Bomb calorimeter is used in many
industries such as metabolic study, food
processing, explosive testing etc.


**(b) ΔH Measurements**

Heat change at constant pressure (at
atmospheric pressure) can be measured
using a coffee cup calorimeter. A schematic
representation of a coffee cup calorimeter
is given in Figure 7.7. Instead of bomb, a
styrofoam cup is used in this calorimeter.
It acts as good adiabatic wall and doesn't
allow transfer of heat produced during
the reaction to its surrounding. This
entire heat energy is absorbed by the
water inside the cup. This method can be
used for the reactions where there is noappreciable change in volume. The change
in the temperature of water is measured
and used to calculate the amount of heat
that has been absorbed or evolved in the
reaction using the following expression.


q = m<sub>w</sub> C<sub>w</sub> ΔT

where m<sub>w</sub> is the molar mass of
water and C<sub>w</sub> is the molar heat capacity of
water (75.29 J K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>)

**Problem 7. 4**

Calculate the enthalpy of combustion of
ethylene at 300 K at constant pressure, if
its heat of combustion at constant volume
(ΔU) is −1406 kJ .

The complete ethylene combustion

C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO<sub>2</sub> (g)+2H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

ΔU = −1406 kJ

Δn = np<sub>(g)</sub> - nr<sub>(g)</sub>

Δn = 2 - 4 = -2

ΔH = ΔU + RTΔn<sub>g</sub>

ΔH = -1406 + (8.314 × 10-3 × 300 ×(-2)

ΔH = -1410.9 kJ

{{< /box >}}


**Applications of the heat of combustion:**

**(1) Calculation of heat of**
**formation:** Since the heat of combustion
of organic compounds can be determined
with considerable ease, they are employed
to calculate the heat of formation of other
compounds.

For example let us calculate
the standard enthalpy of formation
ΔH<sub>f</sub>0 of CH<sub>4</sub> from the values
of enthalpy of combustion for
H<sub>2</sub>, C(graphite) and CH<sub>4</sub> which are - 285.8,
- 393.5, and -890.4 kJ mol-1 respectively.

Let us interpret the information
about enthalpy of formation by writing
out the equations. It is important to note
that the standard enthalpy of formation
of pure elemental gases and elements
is assumed to be zero under standard
conditions. Thermochemical equation
for the formation of methane from its
constituent elements is,

C<sub>(graphite)</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>(g) → CH<sub>4</sub>(g)

ΔH<sub>f</sub><sup>0</sup> = X kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>    --- (i)

Thermo chemical equations for the
combustion of given substances are,

H<sub>2</sub>(g)+1/2O<sub>2</sub>--> H<sub>2</sub>0(I)


ΔH0 = –285.8 kJ <sup>-1</sup>--- (ii)

C<sub>(graphite)</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → CO<sub>2</sub>

ΔH0 = –393.5 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>--- (iii)

CH<sub>4</sub>(g) + 2 O<sub>2</sub> → CO<sub>2</sub>(g)+ 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

ΔH0 = –890.4 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>--- (iv)

Since methane is in the product side
of the required equation (i), we have to
reverse the equation (iv)

CO<sub>2</sub> (g)+2 H<sub>2</sub>O (l) → CH<sub>4</sub> (g) + 2 O<sub>2</sub>

ΔH0 = + 890.4 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>--- (v)

In order to get equation (i) from the
remaining,


(i) = [(ii) × 2] + (iii) + (v)

X = [(–285.8) × 2] + [–393.5] + [+ 890.4]

= –74.7 kJ

Hence, the amount of energy required
for the formation of 1 mole of methane is
-74.7 kJ

The heat of formation methane =
-74.7 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>.

**(2) Calculation of calorific**
**value of food and fuels:** The calorific
value is defined as the amount of heat
produced in calories (or joules) when one
gram of the substance is completely burnt.
The SI unit of calorific value is J kg<sup>-1</sup>.
However, it is usually expressed in cal g<sup>-1</sup>.

**Heat of solution:**

Heat changes are usually observed
when a substance is dissolved in a solvent.
The heat of solution is defined as the
change in enthalpy when one mole of
a substance is dissolved in a specified
quantity of solvent at a given temperature.

**Heat of neutralisation:**

The heat of neutralisation is defined
as “The change in enthalpy when one
gram equivalent of an acid is completely
neutralised by one gram equivalent of a
base or vice versa in dilute solution”.

HCl(aq)+NaOH(aq)→ NaCl (aq)+ H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

ΔH = – 57.32 kJ

H+(aq) + OH-(aq) → H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

ΔH = – 57.32 kJ

The heat of neutralisation of a
strong acid and strong base is around –
57.32 kJ, irrespective of nature of acid or
base used which is evident from the below
mentioned examples.

HCl (aq) + KOH(aq) → KCl (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

ΔH = – 57.32 kJ

HNO<sub>3</sub>(aq)+KOH(aq) → KNO<sub>3</sub>(aq)+ H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

ΔH = – 57.32 kJ

H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>(aq) + 2KOH(aq) →

K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>(aq) + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

ΔH = – 57.32 kJ x 2

The reason for this can be explained
on the basis of Arrhenius theory of acids
and bases which states that strong acids
and strong bases completely ionise in
aqueous solution to produce H+ and OH-
ions respectively. Therefore in all the above
mentioned reactions the neutralisation
can be expressed as follows.

H+(aq) + OH-(aq) → H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

ΔH = – 57.32 kJ

**Molar heat of fusion**

The molar heat of fusion is defined
as “the change in enthalpy when one mole
of a solid substance is converted into the
liquid state at its melting point”.

For example, the heat of fusion of
ice can be represented as
                  
H<sub>2</sub>O(s)  ___273k_______> H2O(l) ΔH<sub>fusion</sub> = + 5.98kJ 


**Molar heat of vapourisation**

The molar heat of vaporisation is
defined as “the change in enthalpy when
one mole of liquid is converted into
vapour state at its boiling point”.

For example, heat of vaporisation
of water can be represented as

H<sub>2</sub>O(l) __373k______>H2O(v)  ΔH<sub>vap</sub>= + 40.626 kJ 

**Molar heat of sublimation**

Sublimation is a process when a
solid changes directly into its vapour state
without changing into liquid state. Molar
heat of sublimation is defined as “the
change in enthalpy when one mole of a
solid is directly converted into the vapour
state at its sublimation temperature”. For
example, the heat of sublimation of iodine
is represented as

I<sub>2</sub>(s)__373k________> I2(v) ΔH<sub.sub> = + 62.42 kJ 


Another example of sublimation process
is solid CO<sub>2</sub> to gas at atmospheric pressure
at very low temperatures.

**Heat of transition**

The heat of transition is defined as
“The change in enthalpy when one mole
of an element changes from one of its
allotropic form to another. For example,
the transition of diamond into graphite
may be represented as

C<sub>(diamond)</sub> C<sub>(graphite)</sub>

ΔH<sub>trans</sub>= +13.81 kJ

Similarly the allotropic transitions in
sulphur and phsphorous can be represented
as follows,

S<sub>(monoclinic)</sub> S<sub>(rhombic)</sub>

ΔHtrans= – 0.067 kJ

P<sub>(white)</sub>------------>  P(red)

ΔHtrans = – 4.301 kJ

**7.8 Hess’s law of constant heat summation**

We have already seen that the heat
changes in chemical reactions are equal
to the difference in internal energy (ΔU)
or heat content (ΔH) of the products and
reactants, depending upon whether the
reaction is studied at constant volume
or constant pressure. Since ΔU and ΔH
are functions of the state of the system,
the heat evolved or absorbed in a given
reaction depends only on the initial state
and final state of the system and not on
the path or the steps by which the change
takes place.

This generalisation is known as
**Hess’s law** and stated as:

The enthalpy change of a reaction
either at constant volume or constant
pressure is the same whether it takes place
in a single or multiple steps provided the
initial and final states are same.

**Application of Hess's Law:** Hess's law can be
applied to calculate enthalpies of reactions
that are difficult to measure. For example,
it is very difficult to measure the heat of
combustion of graphite to give pure CO.

However, enthalpy for the oxidation of
graphite to CO2 and CO to CO2 can easily
be measured. For these conversions, the
heat of combustion values are –393.5 kJ
and – 283.5 kJ respectively.

From these data the enthalpy of
combustion of graphite to CO can be
calculated by applying Hess's law.

The reactions involved in this process can
be expressed as follows
O2(g) C(graphite)

ΔH<sub>1</sub> = ΔH<sub>2</sub> + ΔH<sub>3</sub>

–393.5 kJ= X – 283.5 kJ

X= -110.5 kJ

**7.9 Lattice energy (ΔH<sub>lattice</sub>)**

Lattice energy is defined as the
amount of energy required to completely
remove the constituent ions from its
crystal lattice to an infinite distance from
one mole of crystal. It is also referred as
lattice enthalpy.

NaCl(s) → Na<sup>+</sup>(g) + Cl<sup>-</sup>(g)

ΔH<sub>lattice</sub> = + 788 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

From the above equation it is clear
that 788 kJ of energy is required to separate
Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions from 1 mole of NaCl.

**Born - Haber cycle**

The Born–Haber cycle is an
approach to analyse reaction energies. It
was named after two German scientists
Max Born and Fritz Haber who developed
this cycle. The cycle is concerned with the
formation of an ionic compound from the
reaction of a metal with a halogen or other
non-metallic element such as oxygen.

Born–Haber cycle is primarily used
in calculating lattice energy, which cannot
be measured directly. The Born–Haber
cycle applies Hess's law to calculate the
lattice enthalpy. For example consider the
formation of a simple ionic solid such as
an alkali metal halide MX, the following
steps are considered.

ΔH<sub>1</sub> - enthalpy change for the sublimation
M(s) to M(g)

ΔH<sub>2</sub>- enthalpy change for the dissociation of 1/2X2(g)toX(g).

ΔH<sub>3</sub>- Ionisation energy for M(g) to M<sup>+</sup>(g)

ΔH<sub>4</sub> - electron affinity for the conversion
of X(g) to X<sup>-</sup>(g)

U - the lattice enthalpy for the formation
of solid MX

ΔH<sub>f</sub>- enthalpy change for the formation of
solid MX directly form elements
According to Hess's law of heat summation

∆H<sub>f</sub> =∆H<sub>1</sub> +∆H<sub>2</sub> +∆H<sub>3</sub> +∆H<sub>4</sub>+U

Let us use the Born - Haber cycle for
determining the lattice enthalpy of NaCl
as follows:

Since the reaction is carried out with
reactants in elemental forms and products
in their standard states, at 1 bar, the overall
enthalpy change of the reaction is also the
enthalpy of formation for NaCl. Also, the
formation of NaCl can be considered in 5
steps. The sum of the enthalpy changes of
these steps is equal to the enthalpy change
for the overall reaction from which the
lattice enthalpy of NaCl is calculated.

 Let us calculate the lattice energy of
sodium chloride using Born-Haber cycle

∆H<sub>f</sub> = heat of formation of sodium chloride = – 411.3 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

∆H<sub>1</sub> = heat of sublimation of Na(g) =
108.7 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

∆H<sub>2</sub> = ionisation energy of Na(g) =
495.0 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>.

∆H<sub>3</sub> = dissociation energy of Cl2(g)
= 244 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

∆H<sub>4</sub> = Electron affinity of Cl(S)=
– 349.0 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

U = lattice energy of NaCl
