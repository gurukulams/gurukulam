<h1>GASEOUS STATE</h1>
<hr>
So many properties of
properties of matter, especially
when in gaseous form, can be
deduced from hypothesis that
their minute parts are in rapid
motion, the velocity increasing
with temperature, that the
precise nature of this motion
becomes a subject of rational
curiosity.

#### 6.1. Introduction

We can survive for weeks without
food, days without water, but only minutes
without air. Thus, we inhale a lungful of
air every few seconds, keep some of the
molecules for our own end, and some of
the molecules that our body no longer
needs, and exhale the mixture back into
the surrounding air. The air around
us is in the gaseous state, which is the
simplest of the states of matter. Although
the chemical behaviour of gases depends
on their composition, all the gases have
remarkably similar physical behaviour.


{{< box title="Do you know?" type="objective" >}}


Gas is a substance that is normally
in a gaseous state at room temperature
and 1 atm pressure, while vapour is the
gaseous form of any substance that is a
liquid or solid at room temperature and
1 atm pressure.

Earth is surrounded by an
atmosphere of air whose composition
in volume percentage is roughly 78 %
nitrogen, 21 % oxygen and 1 % other
gases. Of the known elements, only eleven
are gases under normal atmospheric
conditions. The elements hydrogen (H2
),

nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), fluorine
(F<sub>2</sub>) and chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>) exist as gaseous
diatomic molecules. Another form of
oxygen, namely, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is also a gas
at room temperature. The noble gases,
namely, helium (He), neon (Ne), argon
(Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe) and radon
(Rn) of 18th group are monatomic gases.
Compounds such as carbon monoxide
(CO), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen
dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and nitric oxide (NO)
also exist in gaseous state under normal
atmospheric conditions. In this unit you
will learn the properties of gases and other
related phenomena.

#### 6.2. The Gas Laws

The gas laws have played a major
role in the development of chemistry.
The physical properties of all gases
are governed by the gas laws that were
formulated based on the studies of the
properties like pressure, volume, etc., as a
function of temperature. Before studying
the gas laws in detail, let us understand
an important parameter, namely, the
pressure.

Pressure is defined as force divided
by the area to which the force is applied.
The SI unit of pressure is pascal which
is defined as 1 Newton per square meter
(Nm<sup>-2</sup>). There are other units that are
commonly used and their relation with
the SI unit is as follows.


**Table 6.1 Units of pressure**

#### 6.2.1 Boyle’s Law: Pressure-Volume Relationship

Robert Boyle performed a series of
experiments to study the relation between
the pressure and volume of gases. The
schematic of the apparatus used by him is
shown in figure 6.1.

![Figure. 6.1 Boyle’s law experiment](/books/chemistry/part-1/gas/pic1.png)

Mercury was added through the
open end of the apparatus such that the
mercury level on both ends are equal as
shown in the figure 6.1(a). Add more
amount of mercury until the volume of
the trapped air is reduced to half of its
original volume as shown in figure 6.1(b).
The pressure exerted on the gas by the
addition of excess mercury is given by the
difference in mercury levels of the tube.
Initially the pressure exerted by the gas is
equal to 1 atm as the difference in height
of the mercury levels is zero. When the
volume is reduced to half, the difference in
mercury levels increases to 760 mm. Now
the pressure exerted by the gas is equal
to 2 atm. It led him to conclude that at a
given temperature the volume occupied
by a fixed mass of a gas is inversely
proportional to its pressure.

Mathematically, the Boyle’s law can
be written as

V α 1/p  ------(6.1)

(T and n are fixed, T-temperature,
n- number of moles)

V = k * 1/p   ------- (6.2)

k – proportionality constant
When we rearrange equation 6.2.

PV = k ------ (6.2a)(at constant
temperature and mass)

Boyle’s law is applicable to all
gases regardless of their chemical identity
(provided the pressure is low). Therefore,
for a given mass of a gas under two
different sets of conditions at constant
temperature we can write
P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>  = k ------ (6.3)


![Figure. 6.2](/books/chemistry/part-1/gas/pic2.png)


The PV relationship can be
understood as follows. The pressure is
due to the force of the gas particles on the
walls of the container. If a given amount
of gas is compressed to half of its volume,
the density is doubled and the number
of particles hitting the unit area of the
container will be doubled. Hence, the
pressure would increase twofold.

**Consequence of Boyle’s law**

The pressure-density relationship
can be derived from the Boyle’s law as
shown below.

P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>2</sub> V<sub>1</sub> (Boyle’s law)

where “m” is the mass, d<sub>1</sub>
and d<sub>2</sub> are
the densities of gases at pressure P<sub>1</sub>
and P<sub>2</sub>


{{< box title=" Do You Know"="objective" >}} 

In other words, the density of a gas
is directly proportional to pressure.
Most commercial aeroplanes fly at
about 30,000 feet altitude. The pressure
decreases with the increase in altitude
as there are fewer molecules per unit
volume of air. Hence, while at air, the
pressure around the aeroplane will be
so low that one could pass out for lack
of oxygen. For this reason aeroplanes
cabins are artificially pressurized.



Similarly, the effect of drop in
pressure is felt as a little pain in the
ears by a person while ascending a
mountain in a plain. Though the
external pressure drops, the internal
pressure within the ear cavities remains
the same. This creates an imbalance.
The greater internal pressure forces
the eardrum to bulge outward causing
pain. The excess air within the ear
cavities escapes after some time and
with the help of yawning and thereby
equalizing the internal and external
pressure to relieve the pain.

In figure (6.3) let us find the
missing parameters (volume in 6.3 (b) and
pressure in 6.3(c))

**Solution:**

According to Boyle’s law, at constant
temperature for a given mass of gas at
constant temperature,

P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>1</sub> V<sub>2</sub>= P<sub>3</sub> V<sub>3</sub>

1 atm × 1 dm<sup>3</sup> = 2 atm × V<sub>2</sub> = P<sub>3</sub>  × 0.25 dm<sup>3</sup>

∴ 2 atm × V<sub>2</sub>  = 1 atm × 1 dm<sub>3</sub> 

V<sub>2</sub> = 0.5 dm<sup>3</sup>

and P<sub>3</sub> * 0.25 dm<sup?>3</sup> = 1 atm * 1 dm<sup>3</sup>

p<sub>3</sub> = 4 atm

**Evaluate Yourself**

1. Freon-12, the compound widely
used in the refrigerator system as
coolant causes depletion of ozone
layer. Now it has been replaced by
eco-friendly compounds. Consider
1.5 dm3 sample of gaseous Freon at
a pressure of 0.3 atm. If the pressure
is changed to 1.2 atm. at a constant
temperature, what will be the volume
of the gas increased or decreased?

2. Inside a certain automobile engine,
the volume of air in a cylinder is
0.375 dm<sup>3</sup>, when the pressure is 1.05
atm. When the gas is compressed to
a volume of 0.125 dm<sup>3</sup> at the same
temperature, what is the pressure of
the compressed air?

**6.2.2 Charles Law (Volume-temperature relationship)**

The relationship between volume
of a gas and its temperature was examined
by J. A. C. Charles. He observed that for
a fixed mass of a gas at constant pressure,
the volume is directly proportional to its
temperature (K). Mathematically it can be
represented as (at constant P and n)

V = kT ------- (6.5)

or V/T = Constant

If the temperature of the gas
increases, the volume also increases in
direct proportion, so that V/T
is a constant.
For the same system at constant pressure,
one can write

V<sub>1</sub> / T<sub>1</sub>  = V<sub>2</sub> / T<sub>2</sub>  = constant --------> (6.6)

For example, if a balloon is moved
from an ice cold water bath to a boiling
water bath, the temperature of the gas
increases. As a result, the gas molecules
inside the balloon move faster and gas
expands. Hence, the volume increases.


![Figure. 6.4](/books/chemistry/part-1/gas/pic4.png)

**Variation of volume with temperature at constant pressure**

The plot of the volume of the gas
against its temperature at a given pressure
is shown in the figure 6.5. From the graph
it is clear that the volume of the gas linearly
increases with temperature at a given
pressure. Such lines are called isobars. It
can be expressed by the following straight
line equation.

V = mT + C where T is the
temperature in degree Celsius and m & C
are constants.

When T= 0 oC the volume becomes
V0. Hence, V0= C and slope of the straight
line m is equal to ΔV / ΔT. Therefore
the above equation can be written in the
following form.

V  = [ ∆V / ∆T ] T + V<sub>0</sub>  ------- (6.7)

(n, P are constant)

Divide the equation 6.7 by V<sub>0</sub>


![Figure. 6.5](/books/chemistry/part-1/gas/pic5.png)

If we extrapolate the straight line
in the figure 6.5 beyond the experimental
measurements, the straight line intersects
the temperature axis (x-axis) at -2730 C.
This shows that the volume of the gas
becomes zero at -2730 C, more precisely
this temperature is -273.150 C. Beyond this
temperature the gas would have a negative
volume which is physically impossible. For
this reason, this temperature was defined
as absolute zero by Kelvin and he proposed
a new temperature scale with absolute
zero as starting point which is now called
Kelvin scale. The only difference between
the Kelvin scale of temperature and
Celsius scale of temperature is that the
zero position is shifted. The boiling and
freezing point of water in both scales are
given below.

+------------------------+--------------+---------------+
|                        | Kelvin Scale | Celsius scale |
+------------------------+--------------+---------------+
| Absolute Zero          | 0 K          | -273.15 °C    |
+------------------------+--------------+---------------+
| Freezing pointof water | 273.15 K     | 0 °C          |
+------------------------+--------------+---------------+
| Boiling point of water | 373.15 K     | 100 °C        |
+------------------------+--------------+---------------+
