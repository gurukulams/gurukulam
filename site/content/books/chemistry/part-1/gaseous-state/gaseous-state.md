**6.1. Introduction**

We can survive for weeks without
food, days without water, but only minutes without air. Thus, we inhale a lungful of air every few seconds, keep some of the molecules for our own end, and some of the molecules that our body no longer needs, and exhale the mixture back into the surrounding air. The air around us is in the gaseous state, which is the simplest of the states of matter. Although the chemical behaviour of gases depends on their composition, all the gases have remarkably similar physical behaviour.


Do you know the difference
between gas and vapour?

Gas is a substance that is normally in a gaseous state at room temperature and 1 atm pressure, while vapour is the gaseous form of any substance that is a liquid or solid at room temperature and 1 atm pressure.

Earth is surrounded by an
atmosphere of air whose composition in volume percentage is roughly 78 % nitrogen, 21 % oxygen and 1 % other gases. Of the known elements, only eleven are gases under normal atmospheric conditions. The elements hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>),nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), fluorine (F<sub>2</sub>) and chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>) exist as gaseous diatomic molecules. Another form of oxygen, namely, ozone(O<sub>3</sub>) is also a gas at room temperature. The noble gases, namely, helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe) and radon (Rn) of 18th group are monatomic gases.Compounds such as carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogendioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and nitric oxide (NO) also exist in gaseous state under normal atmospheric conditions. In this unit you will learn the properties of gases and other related phenomena.

**6.2. The Gas Laws**

The gas laws have played a major
role in the development of chemistry. The physical properties of all gases are governed by the gas laws that were formulated based on the studies of the properties like pressure, volume, etc., as a function of temperature. Before studying the gas laws in detail, let us understand an important parameter, namely, the pressure. Pressure is defined as force divided by the area to which the force is applied. The SI unit of pressure is pascal which is defined as 1 Newton per square meter (Nm<sup>-2</sup>). There are other units that are commonly used and their relation with the SI unit is as follows.



Pressure = Force N or kg m      s<sup>-2</sup>/Area m<sup>2</sup>

**6.2.1 Boyle’s Law: Pressure-Volume Relationship**

Robert Boyle performed a series of
experiments to study the relation between the pressure and volume of gases. The schematic of the apparatus used by him is shown in figure 6.1.


![chemistry](/books/chemistry/part-1/Gaseousstate/gas3.png)


Mercury was added through the
open end of the apparatus such that the mercury level on both ends are equal as shown in the figure 6.1(a). Add more amount of mercury until the volume of the trapped air is reduced to half of its original volume as shown in figure 6.1(b). The pressure exerted on the gas by the addition of excess mercury is given by the difference in mercury levels of the tube. Initially the pressure exerted by the gas is equal to 1 atm as the difference in height of the mercury levels is zero. When the volume is reduced to half, the difference in mercury levels increases to 760 mm. Now the pressure exerted by the gas is equal to 2 atm. It led him to conclude that at a given temperature the volume occupied by a fixed mass of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure.

Mathematically, the Boyle’s law can be written as


V α 1/P ------- (6.1)

(T and n are fixed, T-temperature,
n- number of moles)

V= k x 1/P------- (6.2)

k – proportionality constant
When we rearrange equation 6.2.

PV = k ------ (6.2a)(at constant
temperature and mass)

Boyle’s law is applicable to all
gases regardless of their chemical identity (provided the pressure is low). Therefore, for a given mass of a gas under two different sets of conditions at constant temperature we can write

P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>= P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>= k ------ (6.3)



![chemistry](/books/chemistry/part-1/Gaseousstate/gas4.png)


The PV relationship can be
understood as follows. The pressure is due to the force of the gas particles on the walls of the container. If a given amount of gas is compressed to half of its volume, the density is doubled and the number of particles hitting the unit area of the container will be doubled. Hence, the pressure would increase twofold.


**Consequence of Boyle’s law**

The pressure-density relationship
can be derived from the Boyle’s law as shown below.


P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>= P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub> (Boyle’s law)


P<sub>1</sub>m/d<sub>1</sub>=P<sub>2</sub>m/d<sub>2</sub>

where “m” is the mass, d<sub>1</sub> and d<sub>2</sub> are the densities of gases at pressure P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub>


P<sub>1</sub>/d<sub>1</sub>=P<sub>2</sub>/d<sub>2</sub> ------ (6.4)

In other words, the density of a gas is directly proportional to pressure.

All the passenger aeroplane cabins have to be artificially pressurised. do you know why?

Most commercial aeroplanes fly at
about 30,000 feet altitude. The pressure decreases with the increase in altitude as there are fewer molecules per unit volume of air. Hence, while at air, the pressure around the aeroplane will be so low that one could pass out for lack of oxygen. For this reason aeroplanes cabins are artificially pressurized.


![chemistry](/books/chemistry/part-1/Gaseousstate/gasd.png)


Similarly, the effect of drop in
pressure is felt as a little pain in the ears by a person while ascending a mountain in a plain. Though the external pressure drops, the internal pressure within the ear cavities remains the same. This creates an imbalance. The greater internal pressure forces the eardrum to bulge outward causing pain. The excess air within the ear cavities escapes after some time and with the help of yawning and thereby equalizing the internal and external pressure to relieve the pain.


In figure (6.3) let us find the
missing parameters (volume in 6.3 (b) and pressure in 6.3(c))


![chemistry](/books/chemistry/part-1/Gaseousstate/gas5.png)


**Solution:**

According to Boyle’s law, at constant temperature for a given mass of gas at constant temperature,

P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>= P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>=P<sub>3</sub>V<sub>3</sub>


1 atm × 1 dm<sup>3</sup>= 2 atm × V<sub>2</sub>= P<sub>3</sub>× 0.25 dm<sup>3</sup>


∴ 2 atm × V<sub>2</sub>= 1 atm × 1 dm<sup>3</sup>

V<sub>2</sub>=1 atm x 1 dm<sup>3</sup>/2 atm

V<sub>2</sub>=0.5 dm<sup>3</sup>

P<sub>3</sub> x 0.25 dm<sup>3</sup>= 1 atm x 1 dm<sup>3</sup>


P<sub>3</sub>=1 atm x 1 dm<sup>3</sup> /0.25 dm<sup>3</sup>

P<sub>3</sub>= 4 atm

**Evaluate Yourself**

1. Freon-12, the compound widely
used in the refrigerator system as
coolant causes depletion of ozone
layer. Now it has been replaced by
eco-friendly compounds. Consider
1.5 dm<sup>3</sup> sample of gaseous Freon at a pressure of 0.3 atm. If the pressure is changed to 1.2 atm. at a constant temperature, what will be the volume of the gas increased or decreased?

2. Inside a certain automobile engine,the volume of air in a cylinder is 0.375 dm<sup>3</sup>, when the pressure is 1.05 atm. When the gas is compressed to
a volume of 0.125 dm<sup>3</sup> at the same temperature, what is the pressure of the compressed air?

**6.2.2 Charles Law (Volume-temperature relationship)**


The relationship between volume
of a gas and its temperature was examined by J. A. C. Charles. He observed that for a fixed mass of a gas at constant pressure, the volume is directly proportional to its temperature (K). Mathematically it can be represented as (at constant P and n)

V = kT ------- (6.5)
or
V/T=constant

If the temperature of the gas
increases, the volume also increases in direct proportion, so that V/T is a constant. For the same system at constant pressure,one can write


V<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>1</sub>=V<sub>2</sub>/T<sub>2</sub>=constant   ----- (6.6)

For example, if a balloon is moved
from an ice cold water bath to a boiling water bath, the temperature of the gas increases. As a result, the gas molecules inside the balloon move faster and ga expands. Hence, the volume increases.


![chemistry](/books/chemistry/part-1/Gaseousstate/gas7.png)


**Variation of volume with temperature at constant pressure**

The plot of the volume of the gas
against its temperature at a given pressure is shown in the figure 6.5. From the graph it is clear that the volume of the gas linearly increases with temperature at a given pressure. Such lines are called isobars. It can be expressed by the following straight line equation.

V = mT + C 

where T is the temperature in degree Celsius and m & C are constants.

When T= 0 <sup>o</sup>C the volume becomes V<sub>0</sub>
. Hence, V<sub>0</sub>= C and slope of the straight
line m is equal to ΔV / ΔT. Therefore the above equation can be written in the following form.


V = [∆V/ΔT]T + V<sub>0</sub>

(n, P are constant) Divide the equation 6.7 by V<sub>0</sub>


V/V<sub>0</sub> = 1/V<sub>0</sub>[∆V/ΔT]T + 1

Charles and Gay Lussac found
that under constant pressure, the relative increase in volume per degree increase in temperature is same for all gases. The relative increase in volume per <sup>0</sup> C (α)is 
equal to 1/V<sub>0</sub>[∆V/ΔT]T + 1

Therefore

V/V<sub>0</sub>=αT+1

V=V<sub>0</sub>(αT+1) ------ (6.9)

Charles found that the coefficient
of expansion is approximately equal to 1/273. It means that at constant pressure for a given mass, for each degree rise in temperature, all gases expand by 1/273 of their volume at 0 <sup>0</sup>C


![chemistry](/books/chemistry/part-1/Gaseousstate/gas8.png)


If we extrapolate the straight line in the figure 6.5 beyond the experimental measurements, the straight line intersects the temperature axis (x-axis) at -273 <sup>0</sup>C. This shows that the volume of the gas becomes zero at -273 <sup>0</sup> C, more precisely this temperature is -273.15 <sup>0</sup>C. Beyond this temperature the gas would have a negative volume which is physically impossible. For this reason, this temperature was defined as absolute zero by Kelvin and he proposed a new temperature scale with absolute zero as starting point which is now called Kelvin scale. The only difference between the Kelvin scale of temperature and Celsius scale of temperature is that the zero position is shifted. The boiling and freezing point of water in both scales are given below.

Example:
In figure 6.6 let us find the missingc parameters (volume in 6.6 (b) and temperature in 6.6(c))


![chemistry](/books/chemistry/part-1/Gaseousstate/gas9.png)

Solution:

According to Charles law,

V<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>1</sub>=V<sub>2</sub>/T<sub>2</sub>=V<sub>3</sub>/T<sub>3</sub>

0.3dm<sup>3</sup>/200K=V<sub>2</sub>/300K=0.15dm<sup>3</sup>/T<sub>3</sub>


V<sub>2</sub>/300K=0.3dm<sup>3</sup>/200K

V<sub>2</sub>=300Kx0.3dm<sup>3</sup>/200K

V<sub>2</sub>=o.45dm<sup>3</sup>

0.15dm<sup>3</sup>/T<sub>3</sub>=0.3dm<sup>3</sup>/200K

T<sub>3</sub>=0.15dm<sup>3</sup>x200K/0.3dm<sup>3</sup>

T<sub>3</sub>=100K

3. A sample of gas has a volume of 3.8 dm<sub>3</sub>at an unknown temperature. When the sample is submerged in ice water at 0°C, its volume gets reduced to 2.27 dm<sub>3</sub>.What is its initial temperature?

**6.2.3 Gay-Lussac’s Law (Pressure-temperature relationship)**

Joseph Gay-Lussac stated that, at
constant volume the pressure of a fixed mass of a gas is directly proportional to temperature.

  P α T


  or

P/T = Constant k

If P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> are the pressures at temperatures T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> , respectively, then from Gay Lussac’s law

P<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>1</sub>= P<sub>2</sub>/T<sub>2</sub>

6.2.4 Avogadro’s Hypothesis
Avogadro hypothesised that equal
volumes of all gases under the same conditions of temperature and pressure contain equal number of molecules. The mathematical form of Avogadro’s hypothesis may be expressed as

V α n

v<sub>1</sub>/n<sub>1</sub>=v<sub>2</sub>/n<sub>2</sub>=constant -------- (6.10)

where V1<sub>1</sub> & n1<sub>1</sub> are the volume and number
of moles of a gas and V<sub>2</sub>& n<sub>2</sub> are a different set of values of volume and number of moles of the same gas at same temperature and pressure.

**Evaluate Yourself*


4. An athlete in a kinesiology research study has his lung volume of 7.05 dm<sup>3</sup>during a deep inhalation. At this volume the lungs contain 0.312 mole of air. During exhalation the volume of his lung decreases to 2.35 dm<sup>3</sup> . How many moles of air does the athlete exhale during exhalation? (assume pressure and temperature remain constant)


**6.3. Ideal gas equation**

The gaseous state is described
completely using the following four variables T, P, V and n and their relationships were governed by the gas laws studied so far.


Boyle’s law
V/P α 1

Charles law V α T

Avogadro’s law V α n

We can combine these equations
into the following general equation that describes the physical behaviour of all gases.

V α nT/P

V α nRT/P

where, R is the proportionality
constant called universal gas constant. The above equation can berearranged to give the ideal gas equation

PV = nRT. ------ (6.11)

We already know that pressure is
expressed in many different units (Table 6.1) hence it is important to know the values of gas constant R in different units as well.

We can calculate R using the
equation,

R= PV/nT

For Conditions in which P is 1
atm., volume 22.414 dm<sup>3</sup>. for 1 mole at273.15 K.

R = 1atm. x 22.414dm<sup>3</sup>/1 mol. x 273.15K

= 0.0821 dm<sup>3</sup> atm. mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>

Under standard conditions (STP)
Where P = 1 bar (10<sup>5</sup> pascal), V= 22.71 × 10<sup>-3</sup> m<sup>3</sup> for 1 mole of a gas at 273.15 K
