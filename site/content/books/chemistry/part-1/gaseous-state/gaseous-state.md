**6.1. Introduction**

We can survive for weeks without
food, days without water, but only minutes without air. Thus, we inhale a lungful of air every few seconds, keep some of the molecules for our own end, and some of the molecules that our body no longer needs, and exhale the mixture back into the surrounding air. The air around us is in the gaseous state, which is the simplest of the states of matter. Although the chemical behaviour of gases depends on their composition, all the gases have remarkably similar physical behaviour.


Do you know the difference
between gas and vapour?

Gas is a substance that is normally in a gaseous state at room temperature and 1 atm pressure, while vapour is the gaseous form of any substance that is a liquid or solid at room temperature and 1 atm pressure.

Earth is surrounded by an
atmosphere of air whose composition in volume percentage is roughly 78 % nitrogen, 21 % oxygen and 1 % other gases. Of the known elements, only eleven are gases under normal atmospheric conditions. The elements hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>),nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), fluorine (F<sub>2</sub>) and chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>) exist as gaseous diatomic molecules. Another form of oxygen, namely, ozone(O<sub>3</sub>) is also a gas at room temperature. The noble gases, namely, helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe) and radon (Rn) of 18th group are monatomic gases.Compounds such as carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogendioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and nitric oxide (NO) also exist in gaseous state under normal atmospheric conditions. In this unit you will learn the properties of gases and other related phenomena.

**6.2. The Gas Laws**

The gas laws have played a major
role in the development of chemistry. The physical properties of all gases are governed by the gas laws that were formulated based on the studies of the properties like pressure, volume, etc., as a function of temperature. Before studying the gas laws in detail, let us understand an important parameter, namely, the pressure. Pressure is defined as force divided by the area to which the force is applied. The SI unit of pressure is pascal which is defined as 1 Newton per square meter (Nm<sup>-2</sup>). There are other units that are commonly used and their relation with the SI unit is as follows.



Pressure = Force N or kg m      s<sup>-2</sup>/Area m<sup>2</sup>

**6.2.1 Boyle’s Law: Pressure-Volume Relationship**

Robert Boyle performed a series of
experiments to study the relation between the pressure and volume of gases. The schematic of the apparatus used by him is shown in figure 6.1.


![chemistry](/books/chemistry/part-1/Gaseousstate/gas3.png)


Mercury was added through the
open end of the apparatus such that the mercury level on both ends are equal as shown in the figure 6.1(a). Add more amount of mercury until the volume of the trapped air is reduced to half of its original volume as shown in figure 6.1(b). The pressure exerted on the gas by the addition of excess mercury is given by the difference in mercury levels of the tube. Initially the pressure exerted by the gas is equal to 1 atm as the difference in height of the mercury levels is zero. When the volume is reduced to half, the difference in mercury levels increases to 760 mm. Now the pressure exerted by the gas is equal to 2 atm. It led him to conclude that at a given temperature the volume occupied by a fixed mass of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure.

Mathematically, the Boyle’s law can be written as


V α 1/P ------- (6.1)

(T and n are fixed, T-temperature,
n- number of moles)

V= k x 1/P------- (6.2)

k – proportionality constant
When we rearrange equation 6.2.

PV = k ------ (6.2a)(at constant
temperature and mass)

Boyle’s law is applicable to all
gases regardless of their chemical identity (provided the pressure is low). Therefore, for a given mass of a gas under two different sets of conditions at constant temperature we can write

P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>= P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>= k ------ (6.3)



![chemistry](/books/chemistry/part-1/Gaseousstate/gas4.png)


The PV relationship can be
understood as follows. The pressure is due to the force of the gas particles on the walls of the container. If a given amount of gas is compressed to half of its volume, the density is doubled and the number of particles hitting the unit area of the container will be doubled. Hence, the pressure would increase twofold.


**Consequence of Boyle’s law**

The pressure-density relationship
can be derived from the Boyle’s law as shown below.


P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>= P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub> (Boyle’s law)


P<sub>1</sub>m/d<sub>1</sub>=P<sub>2</sub>m/d<sub>2</sub>

where “m” is the mass, d<sub>1</sub> and d<sub>2</sub> are the densities of gases at pressure P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub>


P<sub>1</sub>/d<sub>1</sub>=P<sub>2</sub>/d<sub>2</sub> ------ (6.4)

In other words, the density of a gas is directly proportional to pressure.

All the passenger aeroplane cabins have to be artificially pressurised. do you know why?

Most commercial aeroplanes fly at
about 30,000 feet altitude. The pressure decreases with the increase in altitude as there are fewer molecules per unit volume of air. Hence, while at air, the pressure around the aeroplane will be so low that one could pass out for lack of oxygen. For this reason aeroplanes cabins are artificially pressurized.


![chemistry](/books/chemistry/part-1/Gaseousstate/gasd.png)


Similarly, the effect of drop in
pressure is felt as a little pain in the ears by a person while ascending a mountain in a plain. Though the external pressure drops, the internal pressure within the ear cavities remains the same. This creates an imbalance. The greater internal pressure forces the eardrum to bulge outward causing pain. The excess air within the ear cavities escapes after some time and with the help of yawning and thereby equalizing the internal and external pressure to relieve the pain.


In figure (6.3) let us find the
missing parameters (volume in 6.3 (b) and pressure in 6.3(c))


![chemistry](/books/chemistry/part-1/Gaseousstate/gas5.png)


**Solution:**

According to Boyle’s law, at constant temperature for a given mass of gas at constant temperature,

P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>= P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>=P<sub>3</sub>V<sub>3</sub>


1 atm × 1 dm<sup>3</sup>= 2 atm × V<sub>2</sub>= P<sub>3</sub>× 0.25 dm<sup>3</sup>


∴ 2 atm × V<sub>2</sub>= 1 atm × 1 dm<sup>3</sup>

V<sub>2</sub>=1 atm x 1 dm<sup>3</sup>/2 atm

V<sub>2</sub>=0.5 dm<sup>3</sup>

P<sub>3</sub> x 0.25 dm<sup>3</sup>= 1 atm x 1 dm<sup>3</sup>


P<sub>3</sub>=1 atm x 1 dm<sup>3</sup> /0.25 dm<sup>3</sup>

P<sub>3</sub>= 4 atm

**Evaluate Yourself**

1. Freon-12, the compound widely
used in the refrigerator system as
coolant causes depletion of ozone
layer. Now it has been replaced by
eco-friendly compounds. Consider
1.5 dm<sup>3</sup> sample of gaseous Freon at a pressure of 0.3 atm. If the pressure is changed to 1.2 atm. at a constant temperature, what will be the volume of the gas increased or decreased?

2. Inside a certain automobile engine,the volume of air in a cylinder is 0.375 dm<sup>3</sup>, when the pressure is 1.05 atm. When the gas is compressed to
a volume of 0.125 dm<sup>3</sup> at the same temperature, what is the pressure of the compressed air?

**6.2.2 Charles Law (Volume-temperature relationship)**


The relationship between volume
of a gas and its temperature was examined by J. A. C. Charles. He observed that for a fixed mass of a gas at constant pressure, the volume is directly proportional to its temperature (K). Mathematically it can be represented as (at constant P and n)

V = kT ------- (6.5)
or
V/T=constant

If the temperature of the gas
increases, the volume also increases in direct proportion, so that V/T is a constant. For the same system at constant pressure,one can write


V<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>1</sub>=V<sub>2</sub>/T<sub>2</sub>=constant   ----- (6.6)

For example, if a balloon is moved
from an ice cold water bath to a boiling water bath, the temperature of the gas increases. As a result, the gas molecules inside the balloon move faster and ga expands. Hence, the volume increases.


![chemistry](/books/chemistry/part-1/Gaseousstate/gas7.png)


**Variation of volume with temperature at constant pressure**

The plot of the volume of the gas
against its temperature at a given pressure is shown in the figure 6.5. From the graph it is clear that the volume of the gas linearly increases with temperature at a given pressure. Such lines are called isobars. It can be expressed by the following straight line equation.

V = mT + C 

where T is the temperature in degree Celsius and m & C are constants.

When T= 0 <sup>o</sup>C the volume becomes V<sub>0</sub>
. Hence, V<sub>0</sub>= C and slope of the straight
line m is equal to ΔV / ΔT. Therefore the above equation can be written in the following form.


V = [∆V/ΔT]T + V<sub>0</sub>

(n, P are constant) Divide the equation 6.7 by V<sub>0</sub>


V/V<sub>0</sub> = 1/V<sub>0</sub>[∆V/ΔT]T + 1

Charles and Gay Lussac found
that under constant pressure, the relative increase in volume per degree increase in temperature is same for all gases. The relative increase in volume per <sup>0</sup> C (α)is 
equal to 1/V<sub>0</sub>[∆V/ΔT]T + 1

Therefore

V/V<sub>0</sub>=αT+1

V=V<sub>0</sub>(αT+1) ------ (6.9)

Charles found that the coefficient
of expansion is approximately equal to 1/273. It means that at constant pressure for a given mass, for each degree rise in temperature, all gases expand by 1/273 of their volume at 0 <sup>0</sup>C


![chemistry](/books/chemistry/part-1/Gaseousstate/gas8.png)


If we extrapolate the straight line in the figure 6.5 beyond the experimental measurements, the straight line intersects the temperature axis (x-axis) at -273 <sup>0</sup>C. This shows that the volume of the gas becomes zero at -273 <sup>0</sup> C, more precisely this temperature is -273.15 <sup>0</sup>C. Beyond this temperature the gas would have a negative volume which is physically impossible. For this reason, this temperature was defined as absolute zero by Kelvin and he proposed a new temperature scale with absolute zero as starting point which is now called Kelvin scale. The only difference between the Kelvin scale of temperature and Celsius scale of temperature is that the zero position is shifted. The boiling and freezing point of water in both scales are given below.

Solution:

According to Charles law,

V<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>1</sub>=V<sub>2</sub>/T<sub>2</sub>=V<sub>3</sub>/T<sub>3</sub>

0.3dm<sup>3</sup>/200K=V<sub>2</sub>/300K=0.15dm<sup>3</sup>/T<sub>3</sub>


V<sub>2</sub>/300K=0.3dm<sup>3</sup>/200K

V<sub>2</sub>=300Kx0.3dm<sup>3</sup>/200K

V<sub>2</sub>=o.45dm<sup>3</sup>

0.15dm<sup>3</sup>/T<sub>3</sub>=0.3dm<sup>3</sup>/200K

3. A sample of gas has a volume of 3.8 dm<sub>3</sub>at an unknown temperature. When the sample is submerged in ice water at 0°C, its volume gets reduced to 2.27 dm<sub>3</sub>.What is its initial temperature?

**6.2.3 Gay-Lussac’s Law (Pressure-temperature relationship)**

Joseph Gay-Lussac stated that, at
constant volume the pressure of a fixed mass of a gas is directly proportional to temperature.

  P α T


  or

P/T = Constant k

If P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> are the pressures at temperatures T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> , respectively, then from Gay Lussac’s law

P<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>1</sub>= P<sub>2</sub>/T<sub>2</sub>

6.2.4 Avogadro’s Hypothesis
Avogadro hypothesised that equal
volumes of all gases under the same conditions of temperature and pressure contain equal number of molecules. The mathematical form of Avogadro’s hypothesis may be expressed as

V α n

v<sub>1</sub>/n<sub>1</sub>=v<sub>2</sub>/n<sub>2</sub>=constant -------- (6.10)

where V1<sub>1</sub> & n1<sub>1</sub> are the volume and number
of moles of a gas and V<sub>2</sub>& n<sub>2</sub> are a different set of values of volume and number of moles of the same gas at same temperature and pressure.

During exhalation the volume of his lung decreases to 2.35 dm<sup>3</sup> . How many moles of air does the athlete exhale during exhalation? (assume pressure and temperature remain constant)


**6.3. Ideal gas equation**

The gaseous state is described
completely using the following four variables T, P, V and n and their relationships were governed by the gas laws studied so far.


Boyle’s law
V/P α 1

Charles law V α T

Avogadro’s law V α n

We can combine these equations
into the following general equation that describes the physical behaviour of all gases.

V α nT/P

V α nRT/P

where, R is the proportionality
constant called universal gas constant. The above equation can berearranged to give the ideal gas equation

PV = nRT. ------ (6.11)

We already know that pressure is
expressed in many different units (Table 6.1) hence it is important to know the values of gas constant R in different units as well.

We can calculate R using the
equation,

R= PV/nT

For Conditions in which P is 1
atm., volume 22.414 dm<sup>3</sup>. for 1 mole at273.15 K.

R = 1atm. x 22.414dm<sup>3</sup>/1 mol. x 273.15K

= 0.0821 dm<sup>3</sup> atm. mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>

Under standard conditions (STP)
Where P = 1 bar (10<sup>5</sup> pascal), V= 22.71 × 10<sup>-3</sup> m<sup>3</sup> for 1 mole of a gas at 273.15 K


R=10<sup>5</sup>pa x 22.17x10<sup>-3</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/1 mol.x 273.15K


= 8.314 Pa m<sup>3</sup>
K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>

= 8.314 × 10<sup>-5</sup> bar m<sup>3</sup>
K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>

= 8.314 × 10<sup>-2</sup> bar dm<sup>3</sup>

The ideal gas equation is a
relationship between four variables (P, V,T, n). Since it describes the state of any
gas, it is referred to as the equation of state of gases.

Let us calculate the pressure
exerted by 2 moles of sulphur hexafluoride
in a steel vessel of volume 6 dm<sup>3</sup> at 70 °C assuming it is an ideal gas.

We will use the ideal gas equation for this calculation as below:


P=nRT/V

P=2 mol x 0.0821 L K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> x (70+ 273K) / 6 dm <sup>3</sup>

5. A small bubble rises from the bottom of a lake where the temperature and pressure are 8° C and 6.4 atm. to the water surface, where the temperature is 25°C and pressure is 1 atm. Calculate the final volume in (mL) of the bubble, if its initial volume is 2.1 mL.

**6.4 Mixture of gases - Dalton’s law of partial pressures**

Studies of non-reacting gaseous mixtures showed that in a gaseous mixture each component behaves independently. For a gaseous mixture, it is important to know, how the pressure of individual component contributes to the total pressure of the mixture.

John Dalton stated that "the total pressure of a mixture of non-reacting gases is the sum of partial pressures of the gases present in the mixture" where the partial pressure of a component gas is the pressure that it would exert if it were present alone in the same volume and temperature. This is known as Dalton’s law of partial pressures.


i.e., for a mixture containing three
gases 1, 2 and 3 with partial pressures p<sub>1</sub>,p<sub>2</sub> and p<sub>3</sub> in a container with volume V, the total pressure Ptotal will be give by

P<sub>total</sub>=P<sub>1</sub>+P<sub>2</sub> +P<sub>3</sub>

Assuming that the gases behave
ideally,

P<sub>1</sub>=n<sub>1</sub>RT/V

P<sub>2</sub>=n<sub>2</sub>RT/V

P<sub>3</sub>=n<sub>3</sub>RT/V

P<sub>total</sub>=P<sub>1</sub>=n<sub>1</sub>RT/V + P<sub>2</sub>=n<sub>2</sub>RT/V + P<sub>3</sub>=n<sub>3</sub>RT/V


P<sub>total</sub>=(n<sub>1</sub>+n<sub>2</sub>+n<sub>3</sub>)RT/V

P<sub>total</sub>=n<sub>total</sub>(RT/V) ----(6.13)

The partial pressure can also be expressed as

RT/V) can be expressed as P<sub>1</sub>/n<sub>1</sub> or P<sub>2</sub>/n<sub>2</sub> or P<sub>3</sub>/n<sub>3</sub>

or in general P<sub>1</sub>/n<sub>1</sub> 

P<sub>total</sub>=n<sub>total</sub>P<sub>1</sub>/n<sub>1</sub> 

P<sub>total</sub>=n<sub>total</sub>/n<sub>1</sub>.(P<sub>1</sub>)

P<sub>1</sub>=n<sub>1</sub>/n<sub>total</sub>.(P<sub>total</sub>)

P<sub>1</sub>=X<sub>1</sub>P<sub>total</sub>------- (6.14)

where x<sub>1</sub> is the mole fraction of the i
<sup>th</sup> component.


**Application of Dalton’s law**

In a reaction involving the collection of gas by downward displacement of water,
the pressure of dry vapor collected can be calculated using Dalton’s law.


P<sub>dry gas collected</sub>=P<sub>total</sub> - P<sub>water vapour</sub> 

P<sub>water vapour</sub> is generally referred as aqueous tension and its values are available for air at various temperatures.

Let us understand Dalton's law by solving this problem. A mixture of gases contains 4.76 mole of Ne, 0.74 mole of Ar and 2.5 mole of Xe. Calculate the partial pressure of gases, if the total pressure is 2
atm. at a fixed temperature.

**Solution:**

P<sub>Ne</sub>=X<sub>Ne</sub>+  P<sub>toatl</sub>

X<sub>Ne</sub>=n<sub>Ne</sub>/n<sub>Ne</sub>+n<sub>Ar</sub>+n<sub>Xe</sub>

X<sub>Ne</sub> = 4.76/4.76+0.74+2.5 = 0.595

X<sub>Ar</sub>=n<sub>Ar</sub>/n<sub>Ne</sub>+n<sub>Ar</sub>+n<sub>Xe</sub>

X<sub>AR</sub> = 0.74/4.76+0.74+2.5 = 0.093

X<sub>Xe</sub>=n<sub>Xe</sub>/n<sub>Ne</sub>+n<sub>Ar</sub>+n<sub>Xe</sub>

X<sub>Xe</sub>= 2.5/4.76+0.74+2.5 = 0.312

P<sub>Ne</sub> = X<sub>Ne</sub> + P<sub>total</sub>

P<sub>Ne</sub> = 0.595 x 2 = 1.19 atm

P<sub>Ar</sub> = X<sub>Ar</sub> + P<sub>total</sub> = 0.093 × 2
= 0.186 atm.

P<sub>Xe</sub> = X<sub>Xe</sub> + P<sub>total</sub> = 0.312 × 2 = 0.624 atm.

**6.4.1 Graham’ s Law of Diffusion** 

Gases have a tendency to occupy all the available space. When two non -reactive gases are allowed to mix, the gas molecules migrate from region of higher concentration to a region of lower
concentration. This property of gas which involves the movement of the gas molecules through another gases is called diffusion. Effusion is another process in which a gas escapes from a container
through a very small hole.

![chemistry](/books/chemistry/part-1/Gaseousstate/gas10.png)



Figure. 6.7 Diffusion and effusion of gases
The rate of diffusion or effusion is inversely proportional to the square root of molar mass. This statement is called Graham's law of diffusion/effusion.

Mathematically rate of diffusion
&alpha; = 1/&#8730;M

Otherwise

r<sub>A</sub>/r<sub>b</sub> = &#8730;M<sub>A</sub>/M<sub>B</sub>−−−−−−− (6.15)

When diffusing gases are at different pressures (P<sub>A</sub>, P<sub>B</sub> ),

r<sub>A</sub>/r<sub>b</sub> =P<sub>A</sub>/P<sub>B</sub> &#8730;M<sub>A</sub>/M<sub>B</sub>−−−−−−− (6.16)


where r<sub>A</sub> and r<sub>B</sub> are the rates of diffusion
of A and B and the M<sub>A</sub> and M<sub>B</sub> are their
respective molar masses.

Graham’s Law forms the
basis of the process of
enriching the isotopes
of U<sup>235</sup> from other isotopes.

0.5 time that of nitrogen at the same temperature and pressure. Calculate

suggest what this gas might be. (Given that molar mass of bromine = 159.8 g/mole)

**6.5 Deviation from ideal gas behaviour**

The kinetic theory of gases
(postulates of kinetic theory of gases are
described in physics text book) which is the basis for the gas equation (PV=nRT),assumes that the individual gas molecules
occupy negligible volume when compared to the total volume of the gas and there
is no attractive force between the gas molecules. Gases whose behaviour is
consistent with these assumptions under all conditions are called ideal gases. But in practice both these assumptions are not
valid under all conditions. For example, the fact that gases can be liquefied shows
that the attractive force exists among molecules. Hence, there is no gas which
behaves ideally under all conditions. The non-ideal gases are called real gases.
The real gases tend to approach the ideal behaviour under certain conditions.

**6.5.1 Compressibility factor Z**

The deviation of real gases from ideal behaviour is measured in terms of a ratio of PV to nRT. This is termed as compressibility factor. Mathematically,

Z = PV/nRT

For ideal gases PV = nRT, hence the compressibility factor, Z = 1 at all
temperatures and pressures. For these gases the plot of Z vs P should be a straight line parallel to the pressure axis. When a gas deviates from ideal behaviour, its Z value deviates from unity. For all gases, at very low pressures and very high temperature the compressibility factor
approaches unity and they tend to behave ideally. The plot of the compressibility
factor vs pressure for some common gases are shown in Figure 6.8.

![chemistry](/books/chemistry/part-1/Gaseousstate/gas11.png)


**Figure. 6.9 Compressibility factor vs pressure at different temperatures for Nitrogen**



When the pressure is low, the volume of the container is very large compared to
the volume of the gas molecules so that individual volume of the gas molecules can be neglected. In addition, the molecule in a gas are far apart and attractive forces
are negligible. As the pressure increases,the density of gas also increases and the molecules are much closer to one another. Hence, the intermolecular force becomes
significant enough to affect the motion of the molecules and the gas will not behave ideally.

At high temperatures the average kinetic energy of the molecules is very high
and hence inter moleclular attractions will become insignificant. As the temperature decreases, the average kinetic energy
of molecules also decreases, hence the
molecular attraction is enhanced. The temperature at which a real gas obeys
ideal gas law over an appreciable range of pressure is called Boyle temperature or Boyle point. The Boyle point varies with
the nature of the gas. Above the Boyle point, for real gases, Z > 1, ie., the real gases show positive deviation. Below the Boyle point, the real gases first show a decrease for Z, reaches a minimum and then increases with the increase in pressure. So, it is clear that at low pressure
and at high temperature, the real gases behave as ideal gases.

**6.5.2 Compressibility factor for real gases**

The compressibility factor Z for real gases can be rewritten

z = PV<sub>real</sub>/nRT----(6.17)

V<sub>ideal</sub> = nRT/P ----(6.18)

Substituting 6.18 in 6.17

Z = V<sub>real</sub>/V<sub>ideal</sub> ----(6.19)

Where V<sub>real</sub> is the molar volume of
the real gas and V<sub>ideal</sub> is the molar volume of it when it behaves ideally.

**6.5.3 Van der Waals Equation**

J. D. Van der Waals made the first mathematical analysis of real gases. His
treatment provides us an interpretation of real gas behaviour at the molecular
level. He modified the ideal gas equation PV = nRT by introducing two correction factors, namely, pressure correction and
volume correction.

**Pressure Correction:**

The pressure of a gas is directly proportional to the force created by the
bombardment of molecules on the walls of the container. The speed of a molecule
moving towards the wall of the container is reduced by the attractive forces exerted by its neighbours. Hence, the measured gas
pressure is lower than the ideal pressure of the gas. Hence, van der Waals introduced a correction term to this effect.

Van der Waals found out the forces of attraction experienced by a molecule
near the wall are directly proportional to the square of the density of the gas.


P' α ρ<sup>2</sup>

ρ<sup>2</sup>=n/V


where n is the number of moles of gas and V is the volume of the container

P' α n<sup>2</sup>/V<sup>2</sup>

P' = an<sup>2</sup>/V<sup>2</sup>

where a is proportionality constant and depends on the nature of gas

P<sub>ideal</sub>= P+an<sup>2</sup>/V<sup>2</sup> ------ (6.20)

**Volume Correction**

As every individual molecule of a gas occupies a certain volume, the actual
volume is less than the volume of the container, V. Van der Waals introduced
a correction factor V' to this effect. Let us calculate the correction term by considering gas molecules as spheres.

V = excluded volume
Excluded volume for two molecules
    
  = 4/3 &pi;(2r)<sup>3</sup>

  = 8[4/3 &pi;r<sup>3</sup>]
  
  = 8 V<sub>m</sub>

  where v<sub>m</sub> is a volume of a single molecule

  Excluded volume for single molecule

  =8 V<sub>m</sub>/2
  =4 V<sub>m</sub>

  Excluded volume for n molecule
  =n(4 V<sub>m</sub>)
  =nb

  where b is van der walls constant 4 V<sub>m</sub>

  V'= nb

  v<sub>ideal</sub>=v-nb-----(6.21)

Replacing the corrected pressure and volume in the ideal gas equation PV=nRT we get the van der Waals equation of state for real gases as below,

[ P+an<sup>2</sup>/V<sup>2</sup> ](V - nb)= nRT -----(6.22)


**6.6 Pressure-Volume isotherms of Carbon dioxide**

**Andrew's isotherm**

Thomas Andrew gave the first
complete data on pressure-volume- temperature of a substance in the gaseous and liquid states. He plotted isotherms of carbon dioxide at different temperatures which is shown in Figure. 6.12. From the plots we can infer the following.
