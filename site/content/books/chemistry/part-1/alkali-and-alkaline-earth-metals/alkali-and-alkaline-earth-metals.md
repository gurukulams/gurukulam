**5.1 s-Block Elements:**

   The elements belonging to the group 1 and 2 in the modern   periodic table are called s-block elements. The elements belonging to these two groups are commonly known as alkali and alkaline earth metals respectively. In this unit, we study their properties, uses,
   important compounds and biological importance.

**5.2 Alkali metals:**

   The word “alkali” is derived from the word al-qalīy meaning the plant ashes,referring to the original source of alkaline substances. A water-extract of burnt plantashes, called potash contain mainly potassium carbonate. Alkali metal group consists of the elements: lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium and francium. They are all metals, generally soft and highly reactive. They form oxides and hydroxides and these compounds are basic in nature.
    
**5.2.1 General characteristics of alkali metals:**

  Alkali metals are highly reactive and are found in nature only as compounds.Rubidium and caesium are found associated in minute quantities with minerals of otheralkali metals. Francium is radioactive and does not occur appreciably in nature. Francium is highly radioactive; its longest-lived isotope has a half-life of only 21 minutes.

  **Electronic configuration**


    The general valence shell electronic configuration of alkali metals is ns1, where ‘n’ represents the period number.


  **Table 5.2 Electronic configuration of alkali metals**
     


| Element   | Symbol | Atomic No. | Electronic configuration |
|-----------|--------|------------|--------------------------|
| Lithium   | Li     | 3          | [He]2s<sub>1<sub>        |
| Sodium    | Na     | 11         | [Ne]3s<sub>1<sub>        |
| Potassium | K      | 19         | [Ar]4s<sub>1<sub>        |
| Rubidium  | Rb     | 37         | [Kr]5s<sub>1<sub>        |
| Caesium   | Cs     | 55         | [Xe]6s<sub>1<sub>        |
| Francium  | Fr     | 87         | [Rn]7s<sub>1<sub>        |


**Common oxidation state**


  
  All these elements are highly electropositive in nature.They readily lose their valenceelectron to give monovalent cations (M+). Alkali metals have only one oxidation state which is +1.


**Atomic and ionic radii**



Being the first element of each period, alkali metals have the largest atomic and ionic radii in their respective periods. On moving down the group, there is an increase in the number of shells and, therefore, atomic and ionic radii increase. The monovalent ions (M+) are smaller than the respective parent atoms as expected.



**Table 5.3 Physical properties of alkali metals**


| Physical property                                	| Li    	| Na    	| K     	| Rb    	| Cs    	|
|--------------------------------------------------	|-------	|-------	|-------	|-------	|-------	|
| Atomic radius / Metallic radius (Å)              	| 1.52  	| 1.86  	| 2.27  	| 2.48  	| 2.65  	|
| Ionic radius (Å)                                 	| 0.76  	| 1.02  	| 1.38  	| 1.52  	| 1.67  	|

| First ionization enthalpy  (kJ mol<sub>-1</sub>) 	| 520.2 	| 495.8 	| 418.8 	| 403.0 	| 375.7 	|
| Electronegativity (Paulings scale)               	| 1.0   	| 0.9   	| 0.8   	| 0.8   	| 0.7   	|
| Density (g cm<sub>-3</sub>                       	| 0.54  	| 0.97  	| 0.86  	| 1.53  	| 1.90  	|
| Standard potential E0 for M+/M (V)               	| -3.04 	| -2.71 	| -2.92 	| -2.93 	| -2.93 	|
| Hydration enthalpy  (kJ mol<sub>-1</sub>)        	| -506  	| -406  	| -330  	| -310  	| -276  	|


**Ionisation enthalpy**
Alkali metals have the lowest ionisation enthalpy compared to other elements present in the respective period.As we go down the group, the ionisation enthalpy decreases due to the increase in atomic size. In addition, the number of inner shells also increases, which in turn increases the magnitude of screening effect and consequently, the ionisation enthalpy decreases down the group.The second ionisation enthalpies of
alkali metals are very high. The removal of an electron from the alkali metals gives monovalent cations having stable
electronic configurations similar to the noble gas. Therefore, it becomes very difficult to remove the second electron from the stable configurations already attained.




**Hydration enthalpy**


Lithium salts are more soluble than the salts of other metals of group 1. eg.LiClO<sub>4</sub> is upto 12 times more soluble than NaClO<sub>4</sub>. Other salts KClO<sub>4</sub>,RbClO<sub>4</sub> and 
CsClO<sub>4</sub> have solubilities only 10-3 times
of that of LiClO<sub>4</sub>. The high solubility of
Li salts is due to strong solvation of small
size Li+ ion.

**Figure 5.2 Hydration enthalphy of alkali metals**



**Electronegativity:**


Alkali metals have comparatively smaller value of electronegativity than the other elements in the respective period. When they react with other elements,
they usually produce ionic compounds.
For example, they react with halogens to
form ionic halides.


**Flame colour and the spectra:**


When the alkali metal salts moistened with concentrated hydrochloric acid are heated on a platinum wire in a flame, they show characteristic coloured flame as shown below.

  **5.2.2 Distinctive behavior of lithium**


The distinctive behaviour of Li+ ion is due to its exceptionally small size, high polarising power,high hydration energy and non availability of d-orbitals.

**Diagonal Relationship:**

Similarity between the first member of group 1 (Li) and the diagonally placed second element of group 2 (Mg) is called diagonal relationship. It is due to similar size (r<sub>Li</sub>+ = 0.766 Å and r<sub>Mg</sub>2+ = 0.72 Å) and comparable electronegativity values
(Li = 1.0; Mg = 1.2).


5.2.3 **Chemical properties of alkali metals**

Alkali metals exhibit high chemical
reactivity. The reactivity of alkali metals
increases from Li to Cs, since the ionisation
energy decreases down the group. All alkali metals are highly reactive towards the more electronegative elements such as oxygen and halogens. Some characteristic chemical properties of alkali metals are
described below


**Reaction with oxygen.**


All the alkali metals on exposure
to air or oxygen burn vigorously, forming
oxides on their surface. Lithium forms only
monoxide, sodium forms the monoxide
and peroxide and the other elements form
monoxide, peroxide, and superoxides.
These oxides are basic in nature.


4 Li +O<sub>2</sub><span>&#8594;</span>2Li<sub>2</sub>O (simple oxide)


2 Na +O<sub>2</sub><span>&#8594;</span>Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (peroxide)


M + O<sub>2</sub><span>&#8594;</span>MO<sub>2</sub> (superoxide)  
(M= K, Rb,Cs)


**Reaction with hydrogen**


   All alkali metals react with hydrogen at about 673 K (lithium at 1073 K) to form the corresponding ionic hydrides. Reactivity of alkali metals with hydrogen decreases from Li to Cs.

   2M + H<sub>2</sub> <span>&#8594;</span> 
   2 M<sup>+</sup>  +H <sup>-</sup>

   (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs)

   The ionic character of the hydrides increases from Li to Cs and their stability decreases. The hydrides behave as strong reducing agents and their reducing nature increases down the group.


**Reaction with halogen**
   
   
   Alkali metals combine readily with halogens to form ionic halides MX.Reactivity of alkali metals with halogens increases down the group because of corresponding decrease in ionisation enthalpy.


2M + X<sub>2</sub><span>&#8594;</span>2 MX

(M= Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) (X= F, Cl, Br, I)

    All metal halides are ionic crystals.However Lithium iodide shows covalent character, as it is the smallest cation that exerts high polarising power on the iodide anion. Additionally, the iodide ion being the largest can be polarised to a greater extent by Li<sup>+</sup> ion.

**Reaction with liquid ammonia:**
    Alkali metals dissolve in liquid ammonia to give deep blue solutions that are conducting in nature. The conductivity is similar to that of pure metals (The specific conductivity of Hg is 10<sup>4</sup>Ω<sup>-1</sup> and for sodium in liquid ammonia is 0.5 x <sup>4</sup>Ω<sup>-1</sup>). This happens because the alkali metal atom readily loses its valence electron in ammonia solution. Both the cation and the electron are ammoniated to give ammoniated cation and ammoniated electron.


  M + (x + y)NH<sub>3</sub><span>&#8594;</span>[M(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>x</sub> ]<sup>+</sup>+ [e(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>y</sub> ]<sup>-</sup>


  The blue colour of the solution is due to the ammoniated electron which absorbs energy in the visible region of light and thus imparts blue colour to the solution. The solutions are paramagnetic and on standing slowly liberate hydrogen resulting in the formation of an amide.

  M<sup>+</sup> + e <sup>-</sup> + NH<sub>3</sub> → MNH<sub>2</sub>+ ½H<sub>2</sub>


   In concentrated solution, the blue colour changes to bronze colour and become diamagnetic.


**Reaction with water:**

   Alkali metals react with water to give corresponding hydroxides with the liberation of hydrogen.


   2 Li + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O → 2 LiOH+ H<sub>2</sub>


   They also react with alcohol,and alkynes which contain active hydrogens.

   2 Na + 2 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH → 2 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>ONa + H<sub>2</sub>

H-C ≡ C-H Na H-C ≡ C-Na
Na-C ≡ C-Na Na


**Reducing activity:**

   Alkali metals can lose their valence electron readily hence they act as good reducing agents.
   
   M <sub>(s)</sub> → M <sup>+</sup><sub>(g)</sub>  + e<sup>-</sup> 

**Reaction with carbon:**

   Lithium directly reacts with carbon to form the ionic compound, lithium carbide. Other metals do not react with carbon directly. However, when they are treated with compounds like acetylene they form acetelydes.

   2 Li + 2C → Li <sub>2</sub> C <sub>2</sub>

**5.2.4 Uses of alkali metals:**

  *Lithium metal is used to make useful alloys. For example with lead it is used to make ‘white metal’ bearings for motor engines, with aluminium to make aircraft parts, and with magnesium to make armour plates. It is used in thermonuclear reactions.

**5.3 General characteristics of the compounds of alkali metals:**

All the common compounds of the alkali metals are generally ionic in nature. General characteristics of some of their compounds are discussed here.

**Oxides and Hydroxides:**

On combustion in excess of air, alkali metals forms normal oxides with formula M<sub>2</sub>O. They react with water to form corresponding hydroxides which are basic in nature.


M<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O → 2 MOH

Alkali metals apart from lithium form peroxides in addition to normal oxides upon combustion with excess air. These peroxides produce hydroxides and
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> upon reacting with water.


M<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+2 H<sub>2</sub>O → 2MOH+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>

(M = Na, K, Rb, Cs)

Except lithium and sodium, all the other alkali metals form superoxides also. These superoxides also gives basic hydroxides upon treatment with water.


2 MO<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O → 2 MOH + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>

(M = K, Rb, Cs)

Under appropriate conditions pure
compounds M<sub>2</sub>O, M<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or MO<sub>2</sub> may be
prepared


**Properties of oxides and hydroxides:**


The oxides and the peroxides are colourless when pure, but the superoxides are yellow or orange in colour. The peroxides are diamagnetic while the
superoxides are paramagnetic. Sodium peroxide is widely used as an oxidising agent. The hydroxides which are obtained by the reaction of the oxides with water are all white crystalline solids. The alkali metal hydroxides are strong bases. They dissolve in water with evolution of heat on account of intense hydration.


**Halides:**


The alkali metal halides, MX,(X=F, Cl, Br, I) are colourless crystalline solids with high melting points. They can be prepared by the reaction of the
appropriate oxide, hydroxide or carbonate with aqueous hydrohalic acid (HX). As the electropositive character of alkali metal increases from Li to Cs, the ease with which the metals form halides increases from Li to Cs. All halides are ionic in nature except LiBr and LiI. Except LiF, all other halides are soluble in water. The low solubility of LiF in water is due to its high lattice enthalpy (small size of Li+ and
F-).Due to the presence of covalent nature both LiBr and LiI are soluble in organic solvents.

**Salts of oxo-acids:**


Alkali metals form salts with all the oxo-acids. Most of these salts are soluble in water and are thermally stable. As the electropositive character increases down the group, the stability of the carbonates and bicarbonates increases. This is due to the decrease in polarising power of alkali metal cations. The carbonates (M<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) of alkali metals are remarkably stable up to 1273 K, above which they first melt and then eventually decompose to form oxides. However, Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> is considerably less stable and decomposes readily.


Li2CO3 →Δ Li2O + CO2

This is presumably due to large size
difference between Li<sup>+</sup> and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>-2</sup> which makes the crystal lattice unstable. Being strongly basic, alkali metals except lithium form solid bicarbonates. No other metal forms solid bicarbonates.


M<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O → 2 MHCO<sub>3</sub>

(M = Na, K, Rb, Cs)

All the carbonates and bicarbonates are soluble in water and their solubilities increase rapidly on descending the group. This is due to the reason that lattice energies decrease more rapidly than their hydration energies on moving down the group.

**5.3.1 Important compounds of alkali metals:**


**Sodium Carbonate Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.10H<sub>2</sub>O (Washingsoda):**

Sodium carbonate is one of the important inorganic compounds used in industries. It is prepared by Solvay process. In this process, ammonia is converted into ammonium carbonate which then
converted to ammonium bicarbonate by passing excess carbon dioxide in a sodium chloride solution saturated with ammonia. The ammonium bicarbonate thus formed reacts with the sodium chloride to give sodium bicarbonate and ammonium
chloride. As sodium bicarbonate has poor solubility, it gets precipitated. The sodium
bicarbonate is isolated and is heated to give sodium carbonate. The equations involved in this process are,


2NH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub> → (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>


(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub> → 2 NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>


NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>+ NaCl → NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + NaHCO<sub>3</sub>

2 NaHCO<sub>3</sub> → Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O

The ammonia used in this process can be recovered by treating the resultant ammonium chloride solution with calcium hydroxide. Calcium chloride is formed as a by-product.

**Properties:**

Sodium carbonate, commonly known as washing soda, crystallises as decahydrate which is white in colour. It is soluble in water and forms an alkaline solution. Upon heating, it looses the water of crystallisation to form monohydrate. Above 373 K, the monohydrate becomes completely anhydrous and changes to a white powder called soda ash.


Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>·10H<sub>2</sub>O → Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O + 9H<sub>2</sub>O

Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O → Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O


**Uses:**


i.
Sodium carbonate known as washing
soda and is used mainly for laundering.


ii. It is also used in water treatment to
convert the hard water to soft water.


iii. It is used in the manufacturing of
glass, paper, paint etc...


**Sodium chloride NaCl (Cooking salt or Table salt:**

Sodium chloride is isolated by evaporation from sea water which contains 2.7 to 2.9% by mass. Approximately 50 lakh tons of salt are produced annually in India by solar evaporation. Crude sodium chloride can be obtained by crystallisation
of brine solution which contains sodium sulphate, calcium sulphate, calcium chloride and magnesium chloride as impurities. Pure sodium chloride can
be obtained from crude salt as follows.Firstly removal of insoluble impurities by filtration from the crude salt solution with minimum amount of water. Sodium chloride can be crystallised by passing HCl gas into this solution. Calcium and
magnesium chloride, being more soluble than sodium chloride, remain in solution.

Sodium chloride melts at 1081K. It has a solubility of 36.0 g in 100 g of water at 273 K. The solubility does not increase appreciably with increase in temperature.


**Uses:**

(i) It is used as a common salt or table salt for domestic purpose.


ii) It is used for the preparation of many inorganic compounds such as NaOH and Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>


**Sodium hydroxide:**
Sodium hydroxide is prepared commercially by the electrolysis of brine solution in Castner-Kellner cell using a mercury cathode and a carbon anode.
Sodium metal is discharged at the cathode and combines with mercury to form sodium amalgam. Chlorine gas is evolved at the anode. The sodium amalgam thus obtained is treated with water to give
sodium hydroxide.



At cathode: Na<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup> → Na(amalgam)

At anode: Cl<sup>-</sup>→ ½ Cl<sub>2</sub> ↑+ e<sup>-</sup>

2Na(amalgam)+2H<sub>2</sub>O→2NaOH+2Hg+H<sub>2</sub>↑


Sodium hydroxide is a white,translucent and deliquescent solid, that dissolves in water to give a strong alkaline solution. It melts at 591 K. The sodium hydroxide solution at the surface reacts with the CO2 in the atmosphere to form
Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>


**Uses:**
• Sodium hydroxide is used in the purification of bauxite (ore of Aluminium) and petroleum refining

• It is used in the textile industries for
mercerising cotton fabrics

• It is used in the manufacture of soap,
paper and artificial silks.


**Sodium bicarbonate NaHCO3 (Baking soda):**


odium hydrogen carbonate or sodium bicarbonate is used in baking cakes pastries etc. It is called so because it decomposes on heating to generate
bubbles of carbon dioxide, leaving holes in cakes or pastries and making them lightand fluffy. This compound is prepared by saturating a solution of sodium carbonate with carbon dioxide. The white crystalline powder of sodium bicarbonate, being less soluble, precipitated out.


**Uses:**

• Primarily used as an ingredient in
baking.

• Sodium hydrogen carbonate is a mild
antiseptic for skin infections.

• It is also used in fire extinguishers.


**5.4 Biological importance of sodium and potassium**


Monovalent sodium and potassium ions are found in large proportions in biological fluids. These ions perform important biological functions such as
maintenance of ion balance and nerve impulse conduction. A typical 70 kg man contains about 90 g of sodium and 170 g of potassium compared with only 5 g of iron and 0.06 g of copper.

Sodium ions are found primarily on the outside of cells, being located in blood plasma and in the interstitial fluid which surrounds the cells. These
ions participate in the transmission of nerve signals, in regulating the flow of water across cell membranes and in the transport of sugars and amino acids into cells. Sodium and potassium, although so similar chemically, differ quantitatively in their ability to penetrate cell membranes, in their transport mechanisms and in
their efficiency to activate enzymes. Thus,
potassium ions are the most abundant cations within cell fluids, where they activate many enzymes, participate in the oxidation of glucose to produce ATP and, with sodium, are responsible for the transmission of nerve signals.

Sodium–potassium pump play an important role in transmitting nerve signals.

**5.5 Alkaline earth metals:**

Group 2 in the modern periodic table contains the elements beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium and radium. These elements with the exception of beryllium are commonly known as the alkaline earth metals because their oxides and hydroxides are alkaline in nature and these metal oxides are found in the earth’s crust.

**5.5.1 General characteristics of alkaline earth metals:**


**Physical state**

Beryllium is rare and radium is the rarest of all comprising only 10 % of igneous rocks. Magnesium and calcium are very common in the earth’s crust,
with calcium the fifth-most-abundant element, and magnesium the eighth. Magnesium and calcium are found in many rocks and minerals: magnesium
in carnallite, magnesite, dolomite and calcium in chalk, limestone, gypsum. Most strontium is found in the minerals celestite and strontianite. Barium is slightly less common, much of it in the mineral
barite. Radium, being a decay product of uranium, is found in all uranium-bearing ores


![chemistry](/books/chemistry/part-1/basic-concepts-of-chemistry-and-chemical-calculations/image5.5.1.png)


**Electronic configuration:**


These elements have two electrons in the valence shell of their atoms, preceded by the noble gas configuration. Their general electronic configuration is written as [Noble gas]ns2 where ‘n’ represents the valence shell.


**Table 5.8 Electronic configuration of alkaline earth metals:**


| Element 	| Atomic no. 	| Electronic cofiguration 	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| Be 	| 4 	| [He]2s<sup>2</sup> 	|
| Mg 	| 12 	| [Ne]3s<sup>2</sup> 	|
| Ca 	| 20 	| [Ar]4s<sup>2</sup> 	|
| Sr 	| 38 	| [Kr]5s<sup>2</sup> 	|
| Ba 	| 56 	| [Xe]6s<sup>-2</sup> 	|
| Ra 	| 88 	| [Rn]7s<sup>2</sup> 	|



**Atomic and ionic radii:**


The atomic and ionic radii of alkaline earth metals are smaller than the corresponding members of the alkali metals. This is due to the fact the Group 2 elements having a higher nuclear charge
that allows electrons to be attracted more
strongly towards the nucleus. On moving down the group, the radii increases due to gradual increase in the number of the shells and the screening effect.


**Common oxidation state:**

The group 2 elements have two electrons in their valence shell and by losing these electrons, they acquire the stable noble gas configuration. So these elements exhibit +2 oxidation state in their compounds.


**Ionisation enthalpy:**
Due to a fairly large size of the atoms, alkaline earth metals have low ionisation enthalpies when compared to ‘p’ block elements. Down the group the
ionisation enthalpy decreases as atomic size increases. This is due to the addition of new shells as well as increase in the magnitude of the screening effect of inner shell electrons. Members of group 2 have higher ionization enthalpy values than group 1 because of their smaller size, with
electrons being more attracted towards the nucleus of the atoms. Correspondingly they are less electropositive than alkali metals.


**Table 5.9 Physical properties of alkaline earth metals**

**Figure 5.6 Variation of ionisation energy - Alkaline earth metals.**



Although IE<sub>1</sub>values of alkaline
earth metals are higher than that of alkali
metals, the IE<sub>2</sub> values of alkaline earth
metals are much smaller than those of alkali metals. This occurs because in alkali metals the second electron is to be removed from a cation, which has already acquired a noble gas configuration. In the case of alkaline earth metals, the second electron is to be removed from a
monovalent cation, which still has one electron in the outermost shell. Thus, the second electron can be removed more easily in the case of group 2 elements than in group 1 elements.

**Hydration Enthalpies**


Compounds of alkaline earth metals are more extensively hydrated than those of alkali metals, because the hydration enthalpies of alkaline earth metal ions are larger than those of alkali metal ions.


Like alkali metal ions, the hydration enthalpies of alkaline earth metal ions also decrease with increase in ionic size down the group.

Be > Mg > Ca > Sr > Ba

e.g., Magnesium chloride and calcium
chloride exist as their hydrated crystals
MgCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>
O and CaCl<sub>2</sub>. 6H<sub>2</sub>
O respectively.whereas NaCl and KCl do not form such hydrates.


**Electronegativity**


In alkaline earth metals the electronegativity values decrease as we go down the group as seen in the alkali metals.


**Flame colour and the spectra:**


When the alkaline earth metal salts moistened with concentrated hydrochloric acid are heated on a platinum wire in a flame, they show characteristic coloured flame as shown below.

**5.5.2 Distinctive behavior of beryllium**

**Diagonal Relationship:**


As observed in alkali metals, beryllium (the first member of group 2) shows a
diagonal relationship with aluminium. In this case, the size of these ions (r<sub>Be</sub><sup>2+</sup> = 0.45 Å
and r<sub>Al</sub><sup>3+</sup> = 0.54 Å) is not as close. However, their charge per unit area is closer (Be<sup>2+</sup> = 2.36
and Al<sup>3+</sup> = 2.50). They also have same electronegativity values (Be = 1.5; Al = 1.5).

**5.5.3 Chemical properties of alkaline earth metals**

**Reactivity towards the halogens:**


All the alkaline earth metals combine with halogen at elevated temperatures to form their halides.
