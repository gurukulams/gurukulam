**5.1 s-Block Elements:**

   The elements belonging to the group 1 and 2 in the modern   periodic table are called s-block elements. The elements belonging to these two groups are commonly known as alkali and alkaline earth metals respectively. In this unit, we study their properties, uses,
   important compounds and biological importance.

**5.2 Alkali metals:**

   The word “alkali” is derived from the word al-qalīy meaning the plant ashes,referring to the original source of alkaline substances. A water-extract of burnt plantashes, called potash contain mainly potassium carbonate. Alkali metal group consists of the elements: lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium and francium. They are all metals, generally soft and highly reactive. They form oxides and hydroxides and these compounds are basic in nature.
    
**5.2.1 General characteristics of alkali metals:**

  Alkali metals are highly reactive and are found in nature only as compounds.Rubidium and caesium are found associated in minute quantities with minerals of otheralkali metals. Francium is radioactive and does not occur appreciably in nature. Francium is highly radioactive; its longest-lived isotope has a half-life of only 21 minutes.

  **Electronic configuration**


    The general valence shell electronic configuration of alkali metals is ns1, where ‘n’ represents the period number.


  **Table 5.2 Electronic configuration of alkali metals**

  **Common oxidation state**


  
    All these elements are highly electropositive in nature.They readily lose their valenceelectron to give monovalent cations (M+). Alkali metals have only one oxidation state which is +1.
**Atomic and ionic radii**



Being the first element of each period, alkali metals have the largest atomic and ionic radii in their respective periods. On moving down the group, there is an increase in the number of shells and, therefore, atomic and ionic radii increase. The monovalent ions (M+) are smaller than the respective parent atoms as expected.

**Ionisation enthalpy**
Alkali metals have the lowest ionisation enthalpy compared to other elements present in the respective period.As we go down the group, the ionisation enthalpy decreases due to the increase in atomic size. In addition, the number of inner shells also increases, which in turn increases the magnitude of screening effect and consequently, the ionisation enthalpy decreases down the group.The second ionisation enthalpies of
alkali metals are very high. The removal of an electron from the alkali metals gives monovalent cations having stable
electronic configurations similar to the noble gas. Therefore, it becomes very difficult to remove the second electron from the stable configurations already attained.
