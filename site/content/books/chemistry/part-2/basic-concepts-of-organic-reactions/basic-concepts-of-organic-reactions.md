**12.1 Introduction**

A chemical reaction can be treated as a process by which some existing bonds in the reacting molecules are broken and new bonds are formed. i.e., in a chemical reaction, a reactant is converted into a product. This conversion involves one or more steps. A In general an organic reaction can be represented as.

Substrate + Reagent ----> [Intermediate state (and/or) Transition State]----> Product

Here the substrate is an organic molecule which undergoes chemical change. The reagent which may be an organic, inorganic or any agent like heat, photons etc., that brings about the chemical change

Many chemical reactions are depicted in one or more simple steps. Each step passes through an energy barrier, leading to the formation of short lived intermediates or transition
states. The series of simple steps which collectively represent the chemical change, from substrate to product is called as the mechanism of the reaction. The slowest step in the mechanism determines the overall rate of the reaction.

**12.1.1 Fundamental concepts in organic reaction mechanism**

The mechanism is the theoretical pathway which describes the changes occurring in each step during the course of the chemical change. An organic reaction can be understood by following
the direction of flow of electrons and the type of intermediate formed during the course of the reaction. The direction of
flow of electron is represented by curved arrow. The movement of a pair of electron is represented by a double headed arrow
which starts from the negative and ends with the atom to which the electrons needs to be transferred.

**12.1.2 Fission of a covalent bond**

All organic molecules contain covalent bonds which are formed by
the mutual sharing of electrons between atoms. These covalent bonds break in two different ways, namely homolytic cleavage
(symmetrical splitting) and heterolytic cleavage (unsymmetrical splitting). The cleavage of a bond in the substrate is
influenced by the nature of the reagent (attacking agent).
Homolytic Cleavage

**Homolytic Cleavage**

Homolytic cleavage is the process in which a covalent bond breaks
symmetrically in such way that each of the bonded atoms retains one electron.It is denoted by a half headed arrow (fish
hook arrow). This type of cleavage occurs under high temperature or in the presence of UV light in a compound containing non polar covalent bond formed between atoms of similar electronegativity. In such molecules, the cleavage of bonds results into free radicals. They are short lived and are highly reactive. The type of reagents that promote homolytic cleavage in substrate are called as free radical initiators. For example Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) and peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide are used as free radical initiators in polymerisation reactions.

As a free radical with an unpaired electron is neutral and unstable, it has a tendency to gain an electron to attain
stability. Organic reactions involve homolytic fission of C-C bonds to form alkyl free radicals. The stability of alkyl
free radicals is in the following order

̇C(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> >  ̇CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>> ̇CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>> ̇CH<sub>3</sub>

**Heterolytic Cleavage**

Heterolytic cleavage is the process in which a covalent bond breaks
unsymmetrically such that one of the bonded atoms retains the bond pair of electrons. It results in the formation of a cation and an anion. Of the two bonded atoms, the most electronegative atom becomes the anion and the other atom becomes the cation. The cleavage is denoted by a curved arrow pointing towards the more electronegative atom.

For example, in tert-butyl bromide, the C-Br bond is polar as bromine is more electronegative than carbon. The bonding electrons of the C-Br bond are attracted more by bromine than carbon. Hence, the C-Br undergoes heterolytic cleavage to form a tert-butyl cation during hydrolysis.

Let us consider the cleavage in a carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond of aldehydes or ketones We know that the carbon is more electronegative than hydrogen and hence the heterolytic cleavage of C-H bonds results in the formation of carbanion (carbon bears a negative charge). For example in aldol condensation the OH-ion abstracts a α-hydrogen from the aldehyde, which leads to the formation of the below mentioned carbanion.

**Hybridisation of carbon in carbocation:**

In a carbocation, the carbon bearing positive charge is sp<sup>2</sup>hybridised and hence it has a planar structure. In the reaction involving such a carbocation, the attack of a negatively
charged species (nucleophiles) take place on either side of the carbocation as shown below.

The carbanions are generally pyramidal in shape and the lone pair
occupies one of the sp<sup>3</sup> hybridised orbitals. An alkyl free radical may be either pyramidal or planar.

The relative stability of the alkyl carbocations
and carbanions are given below.

Relative stability carbocations.

<sup>+</sup>C(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>> <sup>+</sup>CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>><sup>+</sup>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>><sup>+</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>

relative stability of carbanions

<sup>-</sup>C(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>> <sup>-</sup>CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>><sup>-</sup>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>><sup>-</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>

The energy required to bring about homolytic splitting is greater than that of heterolytic splitting.

**12.1.3 Nucleophiles and elctrophiles**

Nucleophiles are reagents that has high affinity for electro positive centers. They possess an atom has an unshared pair
of electrons, and hence it is in search for an electro positive centre where it can have an opportunity to share its electrons to form a covalent bond, and gets stabilised. They are usually negatively charged ions or electron rich neutral molecules (contains one or more lone pair of electrons). All Lewis bases
act as nucleophiles.

Electrophiles are reagents that are attracted towards negative charge or electron rich center. They are either positively charged ions or electron deficient neutral molecules. All Lewis acids
act as electrophiles. Neutral molecules like SnCl<sub>4</sub>can also act as an electrophile, as it has vacant d-orbitals which can accommodate the electrons from others.


**did you know**

Human body produces free radicals when it is exposed to x-rays, cigarette smoke,industrial chemicals and air pollutants. Free radicals can disrupt cell membranes, increase the risk of many forms of cancer, damage the interior lining of blood vessels and lead to a high risk of heart disease and stroke. Body uses vitamins and minerals to counter the effects of free radicals. Fruits contains antioxidants which decrease the effects of free radicals.

**12.1.4 Electron movement in organic reactions**

All organic reactions can be understood by following the electron
movements, i.e. the electron redistribution during the reaction. The electron movement depends on the nature of the substrate,
reagent and the prevailing conditions. The flow of electrons is represented by curved arrows which show how electrons move
as shown in the figure. These electron movements result in breaking or formation of a bond (sigma or pi bond). The movement
of single electron is indicated by a half -headed curved arrows.

There are three types of electron movement viz.,

• lone pair becomes a bonding pair.

• bonding pair becomes a lone pair

• a bond breaks and becomes another bond.

Some of the properties of organic molecules such as stability, reactivity,basicity etc., are affected by the displacement
of electrons that takes place in its covalent bonds. This movement can be influenced by either the atoms/groups present in close
proximity to the bond or when a reagent approaches a molecule. The displacement effects can either be permanent or a
temporary. In certain cases, the electron displacement due to an atom or a substituent group present in the molecule cause a
permanent polarisation of the bond and it leads to fission of the bond under suitable conditions. The electron displacements
are catagorised into inductive effect (I), resonance effect (R), electromeric effect (E) and hyper conjugation.

**Inductive effect (I)**

Inductive effect is defined as the change in the polarisation of a covalent bond due to the presence of adjacent bonds, atoms or groups in the molecule. This is a permanent phenomenon.

Let us explain the inductive effect by considering ethane and ethylchloride as examples. The C-C bond in ethane is non polar while the C-C bond in ethyl chloride is polar. We know that chlorine is more electronegative than carbon, and hence it attracts the shared pair of electron between C-Cl in ethyl chloride towards itself. This develops a slight negative charge
on chlorine and a slight positive charge on carbon to which chlorine is attached. To compensate it, the C<sub>1</sub>
draws the shared pair of electron between itself and C<sub>2</sub>. This polarisation effect is called inductive effect.
This effect is greatest for the adjacent bonds, but they also be felt farther away. However, the magnitude of the charge separation

decreases rapidly, as we move away from C<sub>1</sub> and is observed maximum for 2 carbons and almost insignificant after 4 bonds from the active group.

It is important to note that the inductive effect does not transfer
electrons from one atom to another but the displacement effect is permanent. The inductive effect represents the ability
of a particular atom or a group to either withdraw or donate electron density to the attached carbon. Based on this ability the
substituents are classified as +I groups and -I groups. Their ability to release or withdraw the electron through sigma covalent bond is called +I effect and -I effect respectively.

Highly electronegative atoms and groups with an atom carrying a positive charge are electron withdrawing groups or –I groups.

Example: -F, -Cl, -COOH, -NO<sub>2</sub>, -NH<sub>2</sub>

Higher the electronegativity of the substitutent, greater is the -I effect. The order of the –I effect of some groups are
given below.

NH<sub>3</sub>> NO<sub>2</sub>> CN > SO<sub>3</sub>H > CHO >
CO > COOH > COCl > CONH<sub>2</sub>> F > Cl >Br > I > OH > OR > NH<sub>2</sub>> C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>> H

Highly electropositive atoms and atoms are groups which carry a negative charge are electron donating or +I groups.
