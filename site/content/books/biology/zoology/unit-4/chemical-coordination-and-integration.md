While hearing your test marks, some may
have anxiety and some may hesitate to
hear and some may be worried. Do you
know the reasons for such immediate
changes? While seeing any unexpected
happenings, we get goose bumps. Do you
know the reason, why?


These are all due to the biochemical
changes happening in our body, Which
are created by the endocrine system. The
above mentioned biochemical changes
are due to the hormone adrenalin (flight,
fright and fight hormone).

#### **11.1 Endocrine glands and hormones**

Physiological functions of our human body
is regulated and coordinated by both neural
and endocrine systems. The endocrine
system influences the metabolic activities
by means of hormones (hormone means
to excite) which are chemical messengers
released into the blood and circulated
as chemical signals and acts specifically
on certain organs or tissues called target
organs or target tissues. Hormones may
speed up or slow down or alter the activity
of the target organs. The hormones
secreted do not remain permanently in
the blood but are converted by the liver
into inactive compounds and excreted by
the kidneys.


Hormones are chemical messengers
because they act as organic catalysts and
coenzymes to perform specific functions in
the target organs. The target organs contain
receptor molecules either on the surface
or within the cell. Although different
hormones come in contact with cells, only
the cells that contain receptor molecules
specific for the hormone are physiologically
activated. A single hormone may have
multiple effects on a single target tissue or
on different target tissues.


![chemical reaction](/books/biology/unit-4/chemical/pic2.png )

Many hormones exhibit long term
changes like growth, puberty and
pregnancy. Hormones often influence
many organs and organ systems at the
same time. Serious deficiency or excess
secretion of hormones leads to disorders.
Hormones coordinate different physical,
physiological, mental activities and
maintain homeostasis. Hormones are
composed of water soluble proteins or
peptides or amines or fat soluble steroids.

#### **11.2 Human endocrine system**

There are two glandular systems such as
the exocrine glands and the endocrine
glands. The exocrine glands secrete
enzymes, saliva and sweat and have
ducts that carry their substances to the
membrane surfaces. Example: salivary
gland and gastric gland. The endocrine
glands, called ductless glands produce
hormones and lack ducts; they release
their hormone to the surrounding tissue
fluid. The hormones circulate around
the body and eventually reach the target
organs. Endocrine glands (Figure: 11. 1)
include the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid,
pineal, adrenal, thymus and are also
known as **exclusive endocrine glands**.
The hypothalamus along with its neural
function also produces hormones and is
considered as a **neuro endocrine gland**. In
addition several organs such as pancreas,
gastro intestinal tract epithelium, kidney,
heart, gonads and placenta are also have
endocrine tissues and are known as **partial**
**endocrine glands**.


#### **11.2.1 Hypothalamus**

Hypothalamus is a small cone shaped
structure that projects downward from
the brain ending into the pituitary stalk.
It interlinks both the nervous system
and endocrine system. Though pituitary
gland is known as master endocrine
glands that controls the other endocrine
glands, but it is, in turn controlled
by the hypothalamus. Hypothalamus
contains groups of neurosecretory cells.
It produces neurotransmitters which
regulate the secretions of the pituitary
(Figure11. 2). The hormones produced by
the hypothalamus act either as a releasing
hormone or as an inhibitory hormone.

In the basal region of the brain, the
**hypothalamic hypophyseal portal**
**blood vessel** connects hypothalamus and
anterior pituitary. It allows hypothalamic
hormones to control anterior pituitary
secretion. The posterior pituitary is
connected with hypothalamus by a nerve
bundle called **hypothalamic hypophyseal**
**axis**. It produces nerve signal that
control the posterior pituitary secretion.
Hypothalamus maintains homeostasis,
blood pressure, body temperature, cardio
and fluid electrolyte balance of the body.
As the part of limbic system it influences
various emotional responses.

In mammals, the role of pars intermedia
is insignificant, but in other vertebrates
it secretes melanocyte stimulating
hormone (MSH). MSH induces
pigmentation in skin.

**11.2.2 Pituitary gland or Hypophysis**

The pituitary gland (means to grow under)
is ovoid in shape and is located in the **sella**
**turcica**, a bony cavity of the sphenoid
bone at the base of brain and connected
to the hypothalamic region of the brain by
a stalk called **infundibulum**. It is about
one centimetre in diameter and 0.5 gm
in weight. The pituitary consists of two
lobes, anterior glandular adenohypophysis
and posterior neural neurohypophysis.
The anterior lobe originates from the
embryonic invagination of pharyngeal
epithelium called **Rathke’s pouch** and
the posterior lobe is originates from
the base of the brain as an outgrowth
of hypothalamus. Anatomically the
adenohypophysis has three lobes or zones
namely pars intermedia, pars distalis and
pars tuberalis. The neurohypophysis is
otherwise known as pars nervosa.

The anterior lobe of pituitary secretes
six tropic hormones such as growth
hormone (GH), thyroid stimulating
hormone (TSH), adreno corticotropic
hormone (ACTH), follicle stimulating
hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone
(LH), luteotropic hormone (LTH) and
melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH)
(in lower animals only). The posterior
lobe of pituitary secretes the hormones
namely vasopressin and oxytocin.


![chemical reaction](/books/biology/unit-4/chemical/pic3.png )

**Hormones of Adenohypophysis**

**i) Growth hormone (GH)**: It is also
known as somatotropic hormone (STH)
or Somatotropin. It is a peptide hormone.
Growth hormone promotes growth of
all the tissues and metabolic process of
the body. It influences the metabolism
of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids and
increases the rate of protein biosynthesis
in the cells. It stimulates chondrogenesis
(cartilage formation), osteogenesis (bone
formation) and helps in the retention
of minerals like nitrogen, potassium,
phosphorus, sodium etc., in the body.

GH increases the release of fatty acid
from adipose tissue and decreases the rate
of glucose utilization for energy by the
cells. Thus it conserves glucose for glucose
dependent tissues, such as the brain.

**ii) Thyroid stimulating hormone**
**(TSH) or thyrotropin:** TSH is a
glycoprotein hormone, which stimulates the
thyroid gland to secrete Tri-iodothyronine
(T3) and thyroxine (T4). TSH secretion is
regulated by negative feedback mechanism.
It’s release from the anterior pituitary
is induced by the thyrotropin releasing
hormone (TRH). When thyroxine level in
the blood increases, TRH acts on both the
pituitary and hypothalamus to inhibit TSH
secretion.


**iii) Adreno cortico tropic hormone**
**(ACTH):** ACTH is a peptide hormone that
stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete
glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.
It stimulates melanin synthesis in
melanocytes, induces the release of fatty
acids from adipose tissues and stimulates
insulin secretion. ACTH secretion
is regulated by negative feedback
mechanism.


**iv) Follicle stimulating hormone**
**(FSH):** FSH is a glycoprotein hormone
which regulates the functions of the
gonads (ovary and testis). In males, FSH
along with androgens acts on the germinal
epithelium of seminiferous tubules and
stimulates the production and release of
sperms (spermatogenesis). In females,
FSH acts on the ovaries and brings about
the development and maturation of
graffian follicles.


**v) Luteinizing hormone (LH):** LH
is a glycoprotein hormone which is also
known as interstitial cell stimulating
hormone (ICSH). In males, ICSH acts on
the interstitial cells of testis to produce
the male sex hormone, testosterone. In
females, LH along with FSH matures
the ovarian follicles. LH independently
induces ovulation, maintains the corpus
luteum and promotes synthesis and
release of ovarian hormones. FSH and LH
are collectively referred as gonadotropins.
FSH and LH are not produced during
childhood. The secretion of FSH and LH
starts only during pre pubertal period.

**vi) Luteotropic hormone (LTH):** LTH
is also called luteotropin or lactogenic
hormone or prolactin or mammotropin. It
is a protein hormone which stimulates milk
secretion after the child birth in females.
High prolactin secretion during lactation
suppresses LH secretion and ovulation
since it induces the corpus luteum hence
named as luteo tropic hormone.

#### **Hormones of neurohypophysis**

**i) Vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone**
**(ADH) :** ADH is a peptide hormone
which promotes reabsorption of water and
electrolytes by distal tubules of nephron
and thereby reduces loss of water through
urine. Hence it is called as anti diuretic
hormone. It also causes constriction
of blood vessels when released in large
amount and increases blood pressure.
ADH deficiency causes **<i>Diabetes insipidus</i>**
which induces the production of large
amount of urine.

**ii) Oxytocin (means quick birth):** It is
a peptide hormone which stimulates
vigorous contraction of the smooth muscles
of uterus during child birth and ejection of
milk from the mammary glands.


{{< box title="" type="objective" >}}


Vasopressin and oxytocin are
composed of nine amino acids and are
almost identical and they differ in only
two amino acids and yet they have
dramatically different physiological
effects.
Amino acid sequence of vasopressin:

cysteine-tyrosine-phenyl alanine-
glutamine-aspargine-cysteine-proline-
arginine-glycine.

Amino acid sequence of
oxytocin:cysteine-tyrosine-isoleu

sine-glutamine-aspargine-cysteine-
proline-leucine-glycine..

Pituitary gland is located in a depression
in the sphenoid bone of skull below the
brain, so is also called hypothalamus
cerebri. Discuss the following :

a. Pituitary gland is commonly called
“master gland” of the body.

b. Discuss the role of hypothalamus
and pituitary as a coordinated unit in
maintaining physiological processes.

c. How does the posterior lobe of
pituitary help in osmoregulation?

{{< /box >}}

#### 11.2.3 Pineal gland

In human, the pineal gland or epiphysis
cerebri or conarium is located behind the
third ventricle of brain and is formed of
parenchymal cells and interstitial cells. It
secretes the hormone, **melatonin**, which
plays a central role in the regulation
of circadian rhythm of our body and
maintains the normal sleep wake cycle.
It also regulates the timing of sexual
maturation of gonads. In addition
melatonin also influences metabolism,
pigmentation, menstrual cycle and
defence mechanism of our body.


{{< box title="DO YOU KNOW" type="objective" >}}

Melatonin is secreted
at night, Light falling
on the retina of eye
decreases melatonin

production.
Circadian rhythm is the 24 hour cycle
of biological activities associated with
natural periods of light and darkness.
Example sleep wake cycle, body
temperature, appetite etc.

{{< /box >}}


**11.2.4. Thyroid gland**

The butterfly shaped thyroid gland is a
bilobed gland located below the larynx on
each side of upper trachea. It is the largest
endocrine gland in the body. Its two lateral
lobes are connected by a median tissue
mass called isthmus. Each lobe is made
up of many lobules .The lobules consist of
follicles called acini (acinus in singular).
Each acinus is lined with glandular,
cuboidal or squamous epithelial cells. The
lumen of acinus is filled with colloid, a
thick glycoprotein mixture consisting of
thyroglobulin molecules.
Hormones of the thyroid gland are often
called the major metabolic hormones. The
follicular cells of thyroid gland secrete two
hormones namely tri-iodothyronine (T3
) and thyroxine or tetra- iodothyronine
(T4). The parafollicular cells or ‘C’ cells
of thyroid gland secrete a hormone
called thyrocalcitonin. Iodine is essential
for the normal synthesis of thyroid
hormones. Thyroid releasing hormone
from the hypothalamus stimulates the
adenohypophysis to secrete TSH, which
inturn stimulates the thyroid gland to
secrete the thyroid hormones. Thyroid
hormones show a negative feedback
effect on the hypothalamus and pituitary
(Figure11. 4).

![chemical reaction](/books/biology/unit-4/chemical/pic4.png )

**Functions of thyroxine or tetra-**
**iodothyronine (T4):** 
Thyroxine regulates
the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and body
heat production. It stimulates protein
synthesis and promotes growth. It is
essential for the development of skeletal
and nervous system. Thyroxine plays
an important role in maintaining blood
pressure. It reduces serum cholesterol
levels, Optimum levels of thyroxine in
blood is necessary for gonadial functions.

**Functions of thyrocalcitonin (TCT):**
TCT is a polypeptide hormone, which
regulates the blood calcium and phosphate
levels. It reduces the blood calcium level and
opposes the effects of parathyroid hormone.


{{< box title="DO YOU KNOW" type="objective" >}}

Iodine is required
for formation of
thyroxine: To produce
normal quantities of
thyroxine, about 1mg/week of iodine is
required. To prevent iodine deficiency
common table salt is iodised with 1 part
sodium iodide to every 1,00,000 parts
of sodium chloride

{{< /box >}}

##### 11.2.5 Parathyroid gland

In human, four tiny parathyroid glands are
found in the posterior wall of the thyroid
glands. This gland is composed of two
types of cells, the chief cells and oxyphil
cells. The chief cells secrete parathyroid
hormone (PTH) and the functions of
oxyphil cells are not known.

**Parathyroid hormone or**
**Parathormone (PTH)**

PTH is a **hypercalcemic hormone**. It is a
peptide hormone involved in controlling the
calcium and phosphate homeostasis. The
secretion of PTH is controlled by calcium
level in the blood. It increases the blood
calcium level by stimulating osteoclasts
to dissolve the bone matrix. As a result
calcium and phosphate are released into
the blood. PTH enhances the reabsorption
of calcium and excretion of phosphates by
the renal tubules and promotes activation of
vitamin D to increase calcium absorption by
intestinal mucosal cells.


**11.2.6 Thymus gland**

Thymus gland is partially an endocrine and
partially a lymphoid organ. It is a bilobed
structure located just above the heart and
aorta, behind the sternum. It is covered
by fibrous capsule and anatomically it is
divisible into an outer cortex and an inner
medulla. It secretes four hormones such as
**thymulin, thymosin, thymopoietin and**
**thymic humoral factor (THF)**. The primary
function of thymus is the production of
immuno competent ‘T’ lymphocytes which
provides cell mediated immunity.


![chemical reaction](/books/biology/unit-4/chemical/pic6.png )


{{< box title="" type="objective" >}}

Old age people are sick often, why?
Due to degeneration of thymus gland,
thymosine level decreases, as a result
the immunity of old age people
becomes weak and causes sickness.

{{< /box >}}

#### 11.2.7 Adrenal gland

A pair of adrenal glands are located at the
anterior end of the kidneys, hence also
called suprarenal glands. Anatomically
the outer region is the cortex and the
inner region is the medulla. Histologically
the adrenal cortex has three distinct
zones, zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata
and zona reticularis. Zona glomerulosa
an outer thin layer constitutes about
15% of adrenal cortex, and secretes
mineralocorticoids. Zona fasciculata,
the middle widest layer constitutes
about 75% of adrenal cortex and
secretes glucocorticoids such as cortisol,
corticosterone and trace amounts of
adrenal androgen and oestrogen. Zona
reticularis, an inner zone of adrenal cortex
constitute about 10% of adrenal cortex
and secretes the adrenal androgen, trace
amount of oestrogen and glucocorticoids.


{{< box title="" type="objective" >}}


Laughing is good for health, because it
reduces the stress hormone (adrenalin)
secretion and makes us to relax.

{{< /box >}}

**Adrenal medulla:** It is the central
part of adrenal gland and is composed
of ovoid and columnar cells, which are
found around the network of blood
capillaries. Adrenalin (epinephrine) and
nor adrenalin (nor epinephrine) are the
two hormones secreted by the adrenal
medulla. Both adrenalin and nor adrenalin
are catecholamines.

**Function of adrenal hormones:**

**Glucocorticoids** stimulate gluconeogensis,
lipolysis and proteolysis (the life saving
activity). **Cortisol** is a glucocorticoid
involved in maintaining cardio vascular
and kidney functions. It produces anti-
inflammatory reactions and suppresses
the immune response. It stimulates the
RBC production. It is also known as stress
combat hormone. **Mineralocorticoids**
regulates water and electrolyte balance
of our body. **Aldosterone** stimulates the
reabsorption of sodium and water and
eliminates potassium and phosphate
ions through excretion, thus it helps in
maintaining electrolytes, osmotic pressure
and blood pressure. Adrenal androgen
plays a role in hair growth in the axial
region, pubis and face during puberty.

**The adrenal medulla** secretes the
hormones adrenalin and noradrenalin and
are referred as "3F hormone" (fight, flight
and fright hormone). Adrenalin increases
liver glycogen breakdown into glucose and
increases the release of fatty acids from fat
cells. During emergency it increases heart
beat rate and blood pressure. It stimulates
the smooth muscles of cutaneous and
visceral arteries to decrease blood flow.
It increases blood flow to the skeletal
muscles thereby increases the metabolic
rate of skeletal muscles, cardiac muscles
and nervous tissue.

{{< box title="" type="objective" >}}

The general function of noradrenalin
is to mobilize the brain and body for
action. It’s secretion is less during
sleep, more during wakefulness and
reaches much higher levels during
stress situations. This response is
known as **‘fight or flight’** response.

**11.2.8 Pancreas**

Pancreas is a composite gland
which performs both exocrine
and endocrine functions. It is
located just below the stomach
as a leaf like structure. The
pancreas is composed of two
major tissues such the acini and
islets of langerhans. Acini secretes
digestive enzymes and the islets
of langerhans secretes hormones
like insulin and glucagon. Human
pancreas has one to two million
islets of langerhans. In each islet
about 60% cells are beta cells, 30%
cells are alpha cells and 10% cells
are delta cells. The alpha cells
secrete glucagon, the beta cells
secrete insulin and delta cells
secrete somatostatin.


**Insulin:** Insulin is a peptide
hormone and plays an important
role in glucose homeostasis. It’s
main effect is to lower blood
glucose levels by increasing the
uptake of glucose into the body
cells, especially muscle and fat
cells. Insulin also inhibits the
breakdown of glycogen to glucose,
the conversion of amino acids or
fats to glucose, so insulin is rightly
called a hypoglycemic hormone.


**Glucagon:** Glucagon is a
polypeptide hormone. It is a
potent hyperglycemic hormone
that acts on the liver and promotes
the breakdown of glycogen
to glucose (Glygogenolysis),
synthesis of glucose from lactic
acid and from non-carbohydrate
molecules (Gluconeogenesis).
Glucagon releases glucose from
the liver cells, increasing the
blood glucose levels. Since glucagon
reduces the cellular uptake and utilisation
of glucose it is called a hyperglycemic
hormone. Prolonged hyperglycemia leads
to the disorder called diabetes mellitus.

**11.2.9 Gonads**

**Testis:**A pair of testis is present in the
scrotal sac of males. The testis functions
as a sex organ and also as an endocrine
gland. The testis is composed of
seminiferous tubules and interstitial cells
or Leydig cells. The Leydig cells secrete
several male sex hormones, collectively
called androgens, mainly testosterone.

**Functions of testosterone:** Under the
influence of FSH and LH, testosterone
initiates maturation of male reproductive
organs, and the appearance of secondary
sexual characters, muscular growth,
growth of facial and axillary hair,
masculine voice and male sexual
behaviour. It enhances the total bone
matrix and plays a stimulating role in the
process of spermatogenesis.


**Ovary:** Females have a pair of
ovaries located in the pelvic region of
the abdomen. The ovary is composed
of ovarian follicles and stromal tissues.
It produces the eggs or ova. The
ovaries secrete the steroid hormones
oestrogen and progesterone. Oestrogen
is responsible for the maturation of
reproductive organs and the development
of secondary sexual characters at puberty.
Along with progesterone, **oestrogens**
promotes breast development and initiate
the cyclic changes during menstrual
cycle. **Progesterone**prepares the uterus
for implantation of the fertilized ovum.
It decreases the uterine contraction
during pregnancy and stimulates the
development of mammary glands and
milk secretion. It is responsible for
premenstrual changes in the uterus
and is essential for the formation
of placenta.


{{< box title="" type="objective" >}}


Identify the peaks of FSH, LH,
Oestrogen and Progesterone hormones

#### 11.2.10 Hormones of heart, kidney and gastro intestinal tract

Some tissues of the heart, kidney and
gastro intestinal tract acts as partial
endocrine glands. In the heart, cardiocytes
on the atrial wall's secretes an important
peptide hormone called atrial natriuretic
factor (ANF). When blood pressure is
increased, ANF is secreted and causes
dilation of the blood vessels to reduce the
blood pressure.


In kidneys, hormones such as renin,
erythropoietin and calcitriol are secreted.
**Renin** is secreted by juxta glomerular cells
(JGA), which increases blood pressure
when angiotensin is formed in blood.
**Erythropoietin** is also secreted by the
JGA cells of the kidney and stimulates
**erythropoiesis** (formation of RBC) in
bone marrow. Calcitriol is sercreted by
proximal tubules of nephron. It is an
active form of vitamin D3 which promotes
calcium and phosphorus absorption from
intestine and accelerates bone formation.




**Gastro intestinal tract hormones**

Group of specialized endocrine cells
present in gastro-intestinal tract
secretes hormones such as gastrin,
**cholecystokinin** (CCK), secretin and
gastric inhibitory peptides (GIP).
**Gastrin** acts on the gastric glands and
stimulates the secretion of HCl and
pepsinogen. **Cholecystokinin**(CCK) is
secreted by duodenum in response to the
presence of fat and acid in the diet. It acts
on the gall bladder to release bile into
duodenum and stimulates the secretion
of pancreatic enzymes and its discharge.
Secretin acts on acini cells of pancreas
to secrete bicarbonate ions and water to
neutralize the acidity. **Gastric inhibitory**
**peptide (GIP)** inhibits gastric secretion
and motility.

### 11.3 Hypo and Hyper activity of endocrine glands and related disorders

The hyper secretion and hypo secretion of
hormones leads to several disorders


**Dwarfism** is due to hyposecretion
of growth hormone (GH) in children,
skeletal growth and sexual maturity is
arrested. They attain a maximum height
of 4 feet only (Figure 11.8).

![chemical reaction](/books/biology/unit-4/chemical/pic9.png )

**Gigantism** is due to hypersecretion
of growth hormone (GH) in children.
Overgrowth of skeletal structure occurs
(up to 8 feet) and the visceral growth is not
appropriate with that of limbs. Figure 11.9.


**Acromegaly** is due to excessive secretion
of growth hormone in adults. Over growth
of hand bones, feet bones, jaw bones,
malfunctioning of gonads, enlargement of
viscera, tongue, lungs, heart, liver, spleen
and endocrine gland like thyroid, adrenal
etc., are the symptoms of acromegaly.
(Figure 11.10)

![chemical reaction](/books/biology/unit-4/chemical/pic11.png )


In infants, hypothyroidism causes
**cretinism**. A cretin shows retarded skeletal
growth, absence of sexual maturity, retarded
mental ability, thick wrinkled skin, protruded
enlarged tongue, bloated face, thick and
short limbs occurs. The other symptoms are
low BMR, slow pulse rate, subnormal body
temperature and elevated blood cholesterol
levels. (Figure 11.11)


![chemical reaction](/books/biology/unit-4/chemical/pic12.png )


Hyposecretion of thyroid in adults
causes **myxodema**. It is otherwise
called **Gull’s disease**. This disease is
characterised by decreased mental
activity, memory loss, slowness of
movement, speech, and general weakness
of body, dry coarse skin, scarce hair, puffy
appearance, disturbed sexual function,
low BMR, poor appetite, and subnormal
body temperature. (Figure 11.12)

![chemical reaction](/books/biology/unit-4/chemical/pic13.png )

Grave’s disease also called as
thyrotoxicosis or exophthalmic goitre.
This disease is caused due to hyper
secretion of thyroid. It is characterised by
enlargement of thyroid gland, increased
BMR (50% - 100%), elevated respiratory
and excretory rates, increased heart beat,
high BP, increased body temperature,
protrusion of eyeball and weakness of eye
muscles and weight loss. (Figure 11.13)

![chemical reaction](/books/biology/unit-4/chemical/pic14.png )


**Simple goitre** is also known as **Endemic**
**goitre**. It is caused due to hyposecretion
of thyroxine. The symptoms includes
enlargement of thyroid gland, fall in serum
thyroxine level, increased TSH secretion.
(Figure 11.14)

![chemical reaction](/books/biology/unit-4/chemical/pic15.png )

**Tetany** is caused due to the
hyposecretion of parathyroid hormone
(PTH). Due to hyposecretion of
PTH serum calcium level decreases
(Hypocalcemia), as a result serum
phosphate level increases. Calcium and
phosphate excretion level decreases.


**Generalized convulsion**, locking of jaws
increased heart beat rate, increased body
temperature, muscular spasm are the
major symptoms of tetany.
Hyperparathyroidism is caused due
to excess PTH in blood. Demineralisation
of bone, cyst formation, softening of bone,
loss of muscle tone, general weakness,
renal disorders are the symptoms of
hyperparathyroidism.


**Addison’s disease** is caused due to
hyposecretion of glucocorticoids and
mineralocorticoids from the adrenal
cortex. Muscular weakness, low BP., loss
of appetite, vomiting, hyper pigmentation
of skin, low metabolic rate, subnormal
temperature, reduced blood volume,
weight loss are the symptoms that occur
in Addison’s disease (Figure 11.15). Reduced
aldosterone secretion increases urinary
excretion of Na Cl. and water and decreases
potassium excretion leading to dehydration.


![chemical reaction](/books/biology/unit-4/chemical/pic16.png )

**Cushing’s syndrome** is caused due to
excess secretion of cortisol. Obesity of the
face and trunk, redness of face, hand, feet,
thin skin, excessive hair growth, loss of
minerals from bone (osteoporosis) systolic
hypertension are features of Cushing’s
syndrome. Suppression of sexual function
like atrophy of gonads are the other
symptoms of Cushing’s syndrome. (Figure
11.16)

![chemical reaction](/books/biology/unit-4/chemical/pic17.png )

**Hypoglycaemia** is due to increased
secretion of insulin thereby blood glucose
level decreases. In this disorder blood
glucose level lowers than normal fasting
index. Increased heartbeat, weakness,
nervousness, headache, confusion, lack
of co-ordination, slurred speech, serious
brain defects like epilepsy and coma occurs.


{{< box title="" type="objective" >}}

**Normal blood glucose level:**

Preprandial : 70 – 110 mg/dl (Before
food) – (Fasting)
Postprandial : 110 – 140 mg/dl (About
two hours after food)

{{< /box >}}

**Hyperglycaemia **is otherwise known
as. **Diabetes mellitus** It is caused due to
reduced secretion of insulin. As the result,
blood glucose level is elevated. Diabetes
mellitus is of two types, Type I Diabetes
and **Type II Diabetes**. **Type I diabetes** is
also known Insulin dependent diabetes,
caused by the lack of insulin secretion
due to illness or viral infections. Type II
diabetes is also known as Non- Insulin
dependent diabetes, caused due to reduced
sensitivity to insulin, often called as
insulin resistance. Symptoms of diabetes
includes, polyurea (excessive urination),
polyphagia (excessive intake of food),
polydipsia (excessive consumption liquids
due to thirst), ketosis (breakdown of fat
into glucose results in accumulation of
ketone bodies) in blood. Gluconeogenesis
(Conversion of non- carbohydrate form
like amino acids and fat into glucose) also
occur in diabetes.


{{< box title="DO YOU KNOW" type="objective" >}}


Avoid use of
synthetic soft drinks
The branded soft
drinks damage our
endocrine system. While consuming
soft drinks, the sugar level increases
in blood which leads to elevated
insulin secretion to reduce the blood
glucose level. The elevated insulin
level diminishes immunity and cause
obesity, cardio-vascular disorders etc.

{{< /box >}}

**Diabates insipidus** is caused due to
hyposecretion of vasopressin (ADH)
from neurohypophysis. The symptom
includes frequent urination (polyurea)
and excessive consumption of liquids due
to thirst (polydipsia).


**11.4 Mechanism of hormoneaction**

Hormones circulate in the blood but
their concentration can increase or
decrease based on the requirement of
the body. This is controlled by feedback
mechanisms. These mechanisms control
the secretion of endocrine glands by
stimulating the hypothalamus, pituitary or
both, which inturn governs the secretion
of a particular hormone. In positive
feedback, the secretion of the hormone
increases where as in negative feedback
further secretion of hormone slows down.
Feedback mechanisms are the key factors
for maintaining homeostasis in our body.
Hormones are classified into three
major groups as peptide hormones,
steroid hormones and amino acid derived
hormones based on their chemical
structure.

Peptide hormones cannot cross the
phospolipid cell membrane and bind to
the receptors on the exterior cell surface.
They are are transported to the golgi,
which is the site of modification. It acts as
a first messenger in the cell. Hormones
on binding to their receptors
do not enter the target cell
but generate the production
of second messengers such as
cyclic AMP (c AMP), which
in turn regulates cellular
metabolism. This is catalyzed
by the enzyme adenylate
cyclase. The interaction
between the hormone at
the surface and the effect
brought out by cAMP within
the cell is known as signaling
cascade. At each step there is
a possibility of amplification.
(Figure 11.17)

1. One hormone molecule
may bind to multiple
receptor molecules before
it is degraded.

2. Each receptor may activate several
adenylate cyclases each of which make
much c AMP.

3. Thus there is more signal after each
step.

The actions of cAMP are terminated
by phosphodiesterases. The effect of
peptide hormones like insulin, glucagon,
somatotropin are usually short lived
because they work through second
messenger system.


Steroid hormones can easily cross the
cell membrane, and bind to their receptors,
which are intracellular or intranuclear.
Upon binding to the receptors, they pair
up with another receptor – hormone
complex (dimerize).This dimer can then
bind to DNA and alter its transcription.
(Figure 11.18)


The effect of steroid hormones such
as aldosterone, oestrogen, FSH are long
lived, as they alter the amount of mRNA
and protein in a cell.
Amino acid derived hormones are
derived from one or two aminoacid with
a few additional modifications. Thyroid
hormone is synthesised from tyrosine
and includes the addition of several
iodine atoms. Epinephrine an amino acid
derivative may function through second
messenger system like peptide hormones
or they may actually enter the cell and
function like steroid hormones.

{{< box title="DO YOU KNOW" type="objective" >}}

Avoid use of steroid components
The abuse of anabolic steroids can
cause serious health problems like
high BP, heart diseases, liver damage,
cancer, stroke and blood clots. Other
side effects of steroid use includes
nausea, vomiting, ligament and
tendon injuries, head ache, joint
pain, muscle cramps, diarrhoea, sleep
problem etc.

#### Summary

Endocrine glands: secrete hormones
which diffuse into blood and induce
the target organs. They are chemical
messengers or organic catalysts which
interact with receptor in the target organs.


Hormones speed up or slow down or
alter the activities of target organs. The
hypo or hyper secretion of hormones
leads to serious effects on human beings.
Hormones coordinate different physical
and mental activities to maintain
homeostasis.


Hypothalamus interlinks nervous
system and endocrine system. It is located
in the diencephalon of cerebrum and
controls the pituitary secretion. Pituitary
gland secretes six tropic hormones which
regulates various physiological functions
of our body. Posterior pituitary gland
secretes vasopressin that regulates water
and electrolyte balance. Oxytocin helps
during child birth. Melatonin secreted by
pineal gland regulates circadian rhythm
of our body. The thyroid gland secretes
thyroxine which stimulates the nervous
system, skeletal growth, and regulates
basal metabolic rate.

![chemical reaction](/books/biology/unit-4/chemical/pic19.png )

Parathyroid gland regulates calcium
level in our body. Thymus gland plays
a vital role in cell mediated immunity by
promoting T lymphocytes maturation.
Pancreas regulates blood glucose
homeostasis through its secretion of
insulin and glucagon.


Adrenal cortex secretes
mineralocorticoids which regulates
mineral metabolism, glucocorticoids
regulates carbohydrate metabolism.
Adrenal medulla secretes the hormones
adrenalin and noradrenalin. In male,
reproductive functions are controlled
by testosterone secreted by the testis. In
female, ovary secretes three hormones
oestrogen, progesterone and relaxin that
regulates reproductive functions.


Hormonal deficiency causes serious
harmful effects in human. It alters
physiological and biochemical functions
of the body. This leads into various
disorders like acromegaly, dwarfism,
tetany, diabetes etc.
