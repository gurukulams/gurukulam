Did you ever wonder how our body
functions? The body maintains a
stable ­condition even when the outside
environment changes; Our eyes help to
see things around us; Ears help us to hear
various sounds; Heart beats continuously
and rhythmically; Air goes in and out of
lungs; Eyes shed tears when our limbs get
hurt. Each cell of the body works in a
coordinated manner. Do you know how it
is ­coordinated and controlled?<br>
The neural system of our body
coordinates all the other systems to work
together ­effectively and smoothly. Every
second, diverse functions in our body are
performed by the neural system. Day and
night, millions of messages pass as stimuli
through the cells of the neural system
to stimulate the heart to beat; kidney to
excrete waste; and mouth to relish the
delicious food. An even more remarkable
feature of the neural system is its ability to
respond simultaneously to several stimuli,
for instance, we can play piano and sing;
listen to music and do household chores. In
all such coordinated movements, whether
skilled performances or routine tasks like
cycling or driving, the integrating power
of the neural system is involved. In this
chapter, you will understand how neural
system is organized; how it integrates all
organs and what kind of cellular events
underlie its functioning.<br>

#### 10.1 Neural system <br>
The neural system comprises of highly
specialized cells called **neurons**, which
can detect, receive, process and transmit
different kinds of stimuli. Simple form of
neural system as nerve net is seen in lower
invertebrates. The neural system of higher
animals are well developed and performs
the following basic functions:<br>
• **Sensory functions-** It receives sensory
input from internal and external
environment.<br>
• **Motor functions-** It transmits motor
commands from the brain to the
skeletal and muscular system.<br>
• **Autonomic functions-** Reflex actions.

### 10.2 Human Neural System <br>
The human neural system is divided into
two, **the central neural system (CNS)**
and **the peripheral neural system (PNS).**
The structural and functional units of the
neural system are neurons that transmit
nerve impulses. The non-nervous special
cells called **neuroglia** form the supporting
cells of the nervous tissue.
There are three functional classes of
neurons. They are the **afferent neurons**
that take sensory impulses to the Central
Neural system (CNS) from the sensory
organs; the e**fferent neurons** that carry
motor impulses from the CNS to the
effector organs; and **interneurons** that
lie entirely within the CNS between the
afferent and efferent neurons.<br>
The central neural system lacks
connective tissue, so the interneuron
space is filled by neuroglia. They perform
several functions such as providing
nourishment to the surrounding neurons;
involving the memory process; repairing
the injured tissues due to their dividing
and regenerating capacity; and acting
as phagocyte cells to engulf the foreign
particles at the time of any injury to the
brain.<br>
{{<box title="">}}
Glial cells do not lose the ability to
undergo cell division; so most brain
tumours of neural origin consists of
glial cells. Neurons themselves do not
form tumours because they are unable
to divide and multiply.<br>
{{</box>}}
### 10.3 Neuron as a structural and functional unit of Neural system <br>
A neuron is a microscopic structure
composed of three major parts namely **cell**
**body** (soma), **dendrites** and **axon**. The
cell body is the spherical part of the neuron
that contains all the cellular organelles
as a typical cell (except centriole). The
plasma membrane covering the neuron
is called **neurilemma** and the axon is
**axolemma.** The repeatedly branched
short fibres coming out of the cell body
are called **dendrites**, which transmit
impulses towards the cell body. The cell
body and the dendrites contain cytoplasm
and granulated endoplasmic reticulum
called **Nissl’s granules.** <br>
An axon is a long fibre that arises from
a cone shaped area of the cell body called
the **Axon hillock** and ends at the branched
distal end. Axon hillock is the place where
the nerve impulse is generated in the
motor neurons. The axon of one-neuron
branches and forms connections with
many other neurons. An axon contains
the same organelles found in the dendrites
and cell body but lacks Nissl’s granules
and Golgi apparatus.<br>

![](/books/zoology/unit-4/neural-control-and-coordination/02.png)<br>
**Figure 10.1** Neuron <br>
The axon, particularly of peripheral
nerves is surrounded by **Schwann cells**
(a type of glial cell) to form myelin
sheath, which act as an insulator. **Myelin**
**sheath** is associated only with the axon;
dendrites are always non-myelinated.
Schwann cells are not continuous along
the axon; so there are gaps in the myelin
sheath between adjacent Schwann
cells. These gaps are called **Nodes of**
**Ranvier.** Large myelinated nerve fibres
conduct impulses rapidly, whereas non-
myelinated fibres conduct impulses quite
slowly (Figure 10.1).

{{<box title="">}}
The longest cells in the human body
are the **neurons**. The **longest** axons
in the **human body**, for example, are
those of the sciatic nerve, which run
from the base of the spine to the big
toe of each foot. These single-cell
fibers may extend a meter or even
longer. The axons of the inter neurons
in the CNS are the shortest.
{{</box>}}

Each branch at the distal end of the axon
terminates into a bulb like structure called
**synaptic knob** which possesses **synaptic**
**vesicles** filled with **neurotransmitters**.
The axon transmits nerve impulses away
from the cell body to an **inter neural**
**space** or to **a neuro-muscular junction.**<br>
The neurons are divided into three
types based on number of axon and
dendrites they possess (Figure.10.2).<br>
**1. Multipolar neurons** have many
processes with one axon and two or more
dendrites. They are mostly interneurons.<br>
**2. Bipolar neurons** have two processes
with one axon and one dendrite. These are
found in the retina of the eye, inner ear
and the olfactory area of the brain.<br>
**3. Unipolar neurons** have a single short
process and one axon. Unipolar neurons
are located in the ganglia of cranial and
spinal nerves.<br>

#### 10.3.1 Generation and conduction of nerve impulses <br>
This section deals with how the nerve
impulses are produced and conducted in
our body. Sensation felt in the sensory
organs are carried by the nerve fibres in
the form of electrical impulses. A nerve
impulse is a series of electrical impulses,
which travel along the nerve fibre. Inner
to the axolemma, the cytoplasm contains
the **intracellular fluid (ICF)** with large
amounts of potassium and magnesium
phosphate along with negatively charged
proteins and other organic molecules.**The**
**extra cellular fluid (ECF)** found outside
the axolemma contains large amounts of
sodium chloride, bicarbonates, nutrients
and oxygen for the cell; and carbon dioxide
and metabolic wastes released by the
neuronal cells. The ECF and ICF (cytosol)
contains negatively charged particles
(anions) and positively charged particles
(cations). These charged particles are
involved in the conduction of impulses.<br>
The neurons maintain an uneven
distribution of various inorganic ions
across their axolemma for transmission
of impulses. This unequal distribution of
ions establishes the membrane potential
across the axolemma. The axolemma
contains a variety of membrane proteins
that act as ionic channels and regulates the
movement of ions across the axolemma.
(Shown in Table 10.1).<br>
#### 10.3.2 Transmission of impulses <br>
The transmission of impulse involves two
main phases; **Resting membrane potential**
and **Action membrane potential**.
**Resting membrane Potential**: The
electrical potential difference across the
plasma membrane of a resting neuron is
called the **resting potential** during which
the interior of the cell is negative due to
greater efflux of \\(K^+\\) outside the cell than

{{<box title="">}}
**Note:** The charged particles have
potential energy. The potential dif-
ference is the measure of potential
energy between two points which is
measured in volts or millivolts.
{{</box>}}

| **Leakage Channels** are ionic channels <br>that remain  open all the time 	| K + leakage channels are more in number than the<br>Na + leakage channels. Sarcolemma has greater<br>permeability to K + ions than Na + ions. These ions<br>keep moving continuosly maintain the potential<br>difference across the axolemma. 	|
|---	|---	|
| **Ligand-gated Channels** are chemically<br>gated channels which open or close in<br>response to a chemical stimuli. 	| They are located between the presynaptic membraneof the first axon <br>and post synaptic membrane ofthe cell body of second neuron [i.e. dendrites and<br>cell bodies]. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine<br>opens ligand channels that allow Na + and Ca ++ ions<br>diffuse inward and K + ions diffuse outward 	|
| **Voltage-gated Channels** are mechanically gated channels which<br>open in response to a physical stimulus in the form of vibration such as touch<br>and pressure. 	| These channels open in response to a change in<br>membrane potential.<br>There are two types of voltage-gated channels.<br>**i. Sodium voltage-gated channel**<br>**ii. Potassium voltage-gated channel** 	|

\\(Na^+\\) influx into the cell. When the axon is
not conducting any impulses i.e. in resting
condition, the axon membrane is more
permeable to \\(K^+\\) and less permeable to \\(Na^+\\)
ions, whereas it remains impermeable to
negatively charged protein ions.

![](/books/zoology/unit-4/neural-control-and-coordination/04.png)<br>
**Figure 10.3** Ionic channels <br>

The
axoplasm
contains
high
concentration of \\(K^+\\) and negatively
charged proteins and low concentration
of \\(Na^+\\) ions. In contrast, fluid outside the
axon (ECF) contains low concentration
of \\(K^+\\) and high concentration of
\\(Na^+\\) , and this forms a concentration gradient. This ionic gradient across the resting membrane is
maintained by ATP driven **Sodium-Potassium** pump, which exchanges \\(3Na^+\\) outwards for \\(2K^+\\) into the cells. In this state, the cell membrane is said to be polarized. In neuron, the **resting membrane** **potential** ranges from **-40mV to -90mV**, and its normal value is **-70mV**. The minus sign indicates that the inside of the cell is negative with respect to the outside (Figure 10.4).<br>
![](/books/zoology/unit-4/neural-control-and-coordination/05.png)<br>
**Figure 10.4** Conduction of nerve impulse <br>

**Action membrane potential** <br>
An action potential occurs when a neuron
sends information down an axon, away
from the cell body. It includes following
phases, depolarization, repolarisation and
hypo polarization.<br>

**Depolarization – Reversal of polarity**
When a nerve fibre is stimulated,
**sodium voltage-gate opens** and makes
the **axolemma** permeable to \\(Na^+\\) ions;
meanwhile **the potassium voltage gate**
closes. As a result, the rate of flow of \\(Na^+\\)
ions into the axoplasm exceeds the rate of
flow of \\(K^+\\) ions to the outside fluid [ECF].
Therefore, the axolemma becomes positively
charged inside and negatively charged
outside. This reversal of electrical charge is
called **Depolarization.** <br>

During depolarization, when enough
\\(Na^+\\) ions enter the cell, the action
potential reaches a certain level,
called threshold potential [-55mV].
The particular stimulus which is able
to bring the membrane potential
to threshold is called **threshold stimulus.** <br>

The action potential occurs in
response to a **threshold stimulus**
but does not occur at **subthreshold stimuli**. This is called **all or none principle**. Due to the rapid influx
of \\(Na^+\\) ions, the membrane potential
hoots rapidly up to +45mV which is called
the **Spike potential**.<br>
**Repolarisation [Falling Phase]** <br>
When the membrane reaches the spike
potential, **the sodium voltage-gate closes**
and **potassium voltage-gate opens**. It
checks influx of \\(Na^+\\) ions and initiates the
efflux of \\(K^+\\) ions which lowers the number
of positive ions within the cell. Thus, the
potential falls back towards the resting
potential.
The reversal of membrane
potential inside the axolemma to negative
occurs due to the efflux of \\(K^+\\) ions. This is
called **Repolarisation**. <br>

**Hyperpolarization**
If repolarization becomes more negative
than the resting potential -70 mV to about
-90 mV, it is called **Hyperpolarization.**
![](/books/zoology/unit-4/neural-control-and-coordination/06.png)<br>
**Figure 10.5** Graph showing Action
potential in Neuron <br>

During this, \\(K^+\\) ion gates are more permeable
to \\(K^+\\) even after reaching the threshold level
as it closes slowly; hence called **Lazy gates**.
The membrane potential returns to its
original **resting state** when \\(K^+\\) ion channels
close completely. During hyperpolarization
the \\(Na^+\\) voltage gate ­remains closed (Figure
10.5).<br>
**Conduction Speed of a nerve impulse**<br>
The conduction speed of a nerve impulse
depends on the diameter of axon. The
greater the axon’s diameter, the faster is the
conduction. The **myelinated axon** conducts
the impulse faster than the **non-myelinated**
**axon**. The voltage-gated \\(Na^+\\) and \\(K^+\\) channels
are concentrated at the **nodes of Ranvier**.
As a result, the impulse jumps node to node,
rather than travelling the entire length of the
nerve fibre. This mechanism of conduction
is called **Saltatory Conduction**. Nerve
impulses travel at the speed of 1-300 m/s.<br>

#### 10.3.3 Synaptic transmission  <br>

The junction between two neurons is
called a **Synapse** through which a nerve
impulse is transmitted. The first neuron
involved in the synapse forms **the pre-synaptic neuron** and the second neuron
is **the post-synaptic neuron**. A small
gap between the pre and postsynaptic
membranes is called **Synaptic Cleft** that
forms a structural gap and a functional
bridge between neurons.
The axon terminals contain synaptic vesicles
filled with **neurotransmitters**. When an
impulse [action potential] arrives at the
axon terminals, it depolarizes the pre-
synaptic membrane, opening the voltage
gated calcium channels. Influx of calcium
ions stimulates the synaptic vesicles
towards the pre-synaptic membrane and
fuses with it. In the neurilemma, the
vesicles release their neurotransmitters
into the synaptic cleft by **exocytosis**. The
released neurotransmitters bind to their
specific receptors on the post-synaptic
membrane, responding to chemical
signals. The entry of the ions can generate
a new potential in the post-synaptic
neuron, which may be either **excitatory**
or **inhibitory**. Excitatory post-synaptic
potential causes depolarization whereas
inhibitory post-synaptic potential causes
**hyperpolarization**
of post-synaptic
membrane (Figure 10.6).<br>
![](/books/zoology/unit-4/neural-control-and-coordination/07.png)<br>
**Figure 10.6** Synaptic Transmission <br>

### 10.4 Central neural system (CNS) <br>
The CNS includes the brain and the
spinal cord, which are protected by the
bones of the skull and vertebral column.
During its embryonic development, CNS
develops from the ectoderm.<br>
{{<box title="">}}
Can you state why some areas of the
brain and spinal cord are grey and some
are white?
{{</box>}}

#### 10.4.1 Brain <br>
The brain acts as the command and
control system. It is the site of information
processing. It is located in the cranial cavity
and is covered by three cranial meninges.
The outer thick layer is **Duramater** which
lines the inner surface of the cranial cavity;
the median thin layer is **Arachnoid mater**
which is separated from the duramater by
a narrow **subdural space**. The innermost
layer is **Piamater** which is closely adhered to
the brain but separated from the arachnoid
mater by the **subarachnoid space**. The
brain is divided into three major regions:
Forebrain, Midbrain and Hindbrain.

**Fore Brain** <br>
It comprises the following regions:
**Cerebrum** and **Diencephalon**. Cerebrum
is the ‘seat of intelligence’ and forms the
major part of the brain. The cerebrum
consists of an outer cortex, inner medulla
and **basal nuclei**. The superficial region
of the cerebrum is called **cerebral cortex**,
which looks grey due to the presence of
unmyelinated nerve cells. Cerebral cortex
consists of neuronal cell body, dendrites,
associated glial and blood vessels. The
surface of the cerebrum shows many
convolutions (folds) and grooves. The
folds are called **gyri** (singular gyrus); the
shallow grooves between the gyri are called
**sulci** (singular sulcus) and deep grooves are
called fissures. These sulci and gyri increase
the surface area of the cerebral cortex.
Several sulci divide the cerebrum into
eight lobes: a pair of **frontals, parietals**,
**temporals and occipital lobes** (Figure10.7
& Table 10.2)<br>
A median longitudinal fissure divides
the cerebrum longitudinally into two
cerebral hemispheres (Figure 10.7). A
transverse fissure separates the cerebral
hemispheres from the cerebellum. The
hemispheres are connected by a tract
of nerve fibres called **corpus callosum**.
Cerebral cortex has three functional areas
namely **sensory areas** occur in the parietal,
temporal and occipital lobes of the cortex.
They receive and interpret the sensory
impulses. **Motor area** of the cortex which
controls voluntary muscular movements
lies in the posterior part of the frontal lobes.
The areas other than sensory and motor
areas are called **Association areas** that deal
with integrative functions such as memory,
communications, learning and reasoning.
Inner to the cortex is **medulla** which is
white in colour and acts as a nerve tract
between the cortex and the diencephalon.

Table 10.2 Functions of brain lobes <br>
| **Structure** 	| **Functions** 	|
|---	|---	|
| Frontal 	| Behaviour, Intelligence,<br>Memory, Movement 	|
| Parietal 	| Language, Reading, Sensation 	|
| Temporal 	| Speech, Hearing, Memory 	|
| Occipital 	| Visual processing 	|



![](/books/zoology/unit-4/neural-control-and-coordination/08.png)<br>
**Figure 10.7** Lobes of Cerebral hemisphere <br>

**Diencephalon** consists largely
following three paired structures.

**Epithalamus** forms the roof of the
diencephalon and it is a non-nervous tissue.
The anterior part of epithalamus is vascular
and folded to form the anterior **choroid**
**plexus**. Just behind the choroid plexus, the
epithalamus forms a short stalk which ends
in a rounded body called **pineal body** which
secretes the hormone, **melatonin** which
regulates sleep and wake cycle. <br>

**Thalamus** is composed of grey
mater which serves as a relay centre for
impulses between the spinal cord, brain
stem and cerebrum. Within the thalamus,
information is sorted and edited and plays
a key role inlearning and memory. It is a
major coordinating centre for sensory and
motor signalling.

{{<box title>}}
Human brain is formed of a large
number of parts like cerebrum, thalamus,
hypothalamus, pons, cerebellum and
medulla oblongata. Each part performs
some specialized function and all the parts
are essential for the survival of a person.
Discuss the following statements :<br>
a)Thalami are called relay centres of
the brain.<br>
b) Damage to medulla may cause the
death of organism.
{{</box>}}

![](/books/zoology/unit-4/neural-control-and-coordination/9.png)<br>
**Figure 10.8** Mid sagittal section of brain <br>

**Hypothalamus** forms the floor of the
diencephalon. The downward extension
of the hypothalamus, the **infundibulum**
connects the hypothalamus with the pituitary
gland. The hypothalamus contains a pair of
small rounded body called **mammillary**
**bodies** that are involved in olfactory
reflexes and emotional responses to odour.
Hypothalamus maintains homeostasis and
has many centres which control the body
temperature, urge for eating and drinking.
It also contains a group of neurosecretory
cells which secrete the hypothalamic
hormones. Hypothalamus also acts as the
**satiety centre**.

{{<box title="">}}
Depression is a functional deficiency
of seratonin or norepinephrine or
both. This disorder is characterized
by a pervasive negative mood, loss
of interest, an inability to experience
pleasure and suicidal tendencies.
Antidepressant drugs increase the
available concentration of these
neurotransmitters in the CNS. Hence
depression is treatable.
{{</box>}}

**Limbic system** <br>
The inner hemisphere
part of constitutes the the
cerebral limbic system. The main components of limbic
system are **olfactory bulbs, cingulate gyrus, mammillary body, amygdala,hippocampus and** **hypothalamus**.
The limbic system is called ‘emotional brain’ because it plays a primary role in
the regulation of pleasure, pain, anger,
fear, sexual feeling and affection. The hippocampus and amygdala also play a role in memory (Figure 10.9). <br>
**Brain stem** is the part of the brain between
the spinal cord and the diencephalon. It
consists of mid brain, pons varolii and
medulla oblongata (Figure 10.10).

![](/books/zoology/unit-4/neural-control-and-coordination/10.png)<br>
**Figure 10.10** Brain stem <br>

**Mid brain** <br>
The mid brain is located between the
diencephalon and the pons. The lower
portion of the midbrain consists of a
pair of longitudinal bands of nervous
tissue called **cerebral peduncles** which
relay impulses back and forth between
cerebrum, cerebellum, pons and medulla.
The dorsal portion of the midbrain consists
of four rounded bodies called **corpora**
**quadrigemina** which acts as a reflex centre
for vision and hearing.

**Hind brain** <br>
Rhombencephalon forms the hind brain.
It comprises of cerebellum, pons varolii
and medulla oblongata. **Cerebellum** is <br>
![](/books/zoology/unit-4/neural-control-and-coordination/11.png)<br>
**Figure 10.9** Limbic system <br>

the second largest part of the brain. It
consists of two **cerebellar hemispheres**
and central worm shaped part, **the vermis**.
The cerebellum controls and coordinates
muscular movements and body equilibrium. Any damage to cerebellum
often results in uncoordinated voluntary
muscle movements.<br>
**Pons varoli** lies infront of the
cerebellum between the midbrain and the
medulla oblongata. The nerve fibres in the
pons varolii form a bridge between the two
cerebellar hemispheres and connect the
medulla oblongata with the other region
of the brain. The respiratory nuclei found
in the pons cooperate with the medulla to
control respiration.<br>
**Medulla oblongata** forms the posterior
most part of the brain. It connects the spinal
cord with various parts of the brain. It
receives and integrates signals from spinal
cord and sends it to the cerebellum and
thalamus. Medulla contains vital centres
that control cardio vascular reflexes,
respiration and gastric secretions.

**Ventricles of the brain** <br>
The brain has four hollow, fluid filled
spaces. The C- shaped space found
inside each cerebral hemisphere forms
the lateral **ventricles I and II** which
are separated from each other by a thin
membrane called the **septum pellucidum**.
Each lateral ventricle communicates
with the narrow III ventricle in the
diencephalon through an opening called
**interventricular foramen (foramen of**
**Monro)**. The ventricle III is continuous
with the ventricle IV in the hind brain
through a canal called **aqueduct of**
**Sylvius (cerebral aqueduct)**. Choroid
plexus is a network of blood capillaries
found in the roof of the ventricles and
forms **cerebro spinal fluid (CSF)** from
the blood. CSF provides buoyancy to
the CNS structures; CSF acts as a shock
absorber for the brain and spinal cord; it
nourishes the brain cells by transporting
constant supply of food and oxygen; it
carries harmful metabolic wastes from
the brain to the blood; and maintains
a constant pressure inside the cranial
vessels.

#### 10.4.2 Spinal cord <br>
The spinal cord is a long, slender, cylindrical
nervous tissue. It is protected by the
vertebral column and surrounded by the
three membranes as in the brain. The spinal
cord that extends from the brain stem into
the vertebral canal of the vertebral column
up to the level of \\(1^st\\) or \\(2^nd\\) lumbar vertebra.
So the nerve roots of the remaining nerves
are greatly elongated to exit the vertebral
column at their appropriate space. The
thick bundle of elongated nerve roots
within the lower vertebral canal is called
the **cauda equina** (horse’s tail) because of
its appearance.
In the cross section of spinal cord
(Figure 10.11), there are two indentations:
the posterior median sulcus and the
anterior median fissure. Although there
might be slight variations, the cross
section of spinal cord is generally the same
throughout its length. In contrast to the
brain, the grey matter in the spinal cord
forms an inner butterfly shaped region
surrounded by the outer white matter.
The grey matter consists of neuronal cell
bodies and their dendrites, interneurons
and glial cells. White matter consists of
bundles of nerve fibres. In the center of
the grey matter there is a central canal
which is filled with CSF. Each half of the
grey matter is divided into a **dorsal horn,**
**a ventral horn** and **a lateral horn**.
The dorsal horn contains cell bodies of
interneurons on which afferent neurons
terminate. The ventral horn contains cell
bodies of the efferent motor neurons supplying
the skeletal muscle. Autonomic nerve fibres,
supplying cardiac and smooth muscles and
exocrine glands, originate from the cell bodies
found in the lateral horn. In the white matter,
the bundles of nerve fibres form two types of <br>
![](/books/zoology/unit-4/neural-control-and-coordination/12.png)<br>
**Figure 10.11** C.S. of Spinal cord <br>
tracts namely **ascending tracts** which carry
sensory impulses to the brain and descending
**tracts** which carry motor impulses from the
brain to the spinal nerves at various levels of
the spinal cord. The spinal cord shows two
enlargements, one in the cervical region and
another one in the lumbosacral region. The
**cervical enlargement** serves the upper limb
and **lumbar enlargement** serves the
lower limbs.

### 10.5 Reflex action and Reflex arc <br>
When dust falls in our eyes, the eyelids
close immediately not waiting for our
willingness; on touching a hot pan, the
hand is withdrawn rapidly. Do you know
how this happens? <br>
The spinal cord remains as a
connecting functional nervous structure
in between the brain and effector organs.
But sometimes when a very quick response
is needed, the spinal cord can effect motor
initiation as the brain and brings about an
effect. This rapid action by spinal cord is
called reflex action. It is a fast, involuntary,
unplanned sequence of actions that occurs
in response to a particular stimulus. The
nervous elements involved in carrying out
the reflex action constitute a reflex arc or
in other words the pathway followed by a
nerve impulse to produce a reflex action is
called a reflex arc ­(Figure 10.12).

**Functional components of a reflex arc**<br>
Sensory Receptor - It is a sensory structure
that responds to a specific stimulus.<br>
Sensory Neuron - This neuron takes
the sensory impulse to the grey (afferent)
matter of the spinal cord through the
dorsal root of the spinal cord.<br>
Interneurons - One or two interneurons
may serve to transmit the impulses from
the sensory neuron to the motor neuron.<br>
Motor Neuron - it transmits impulse
from CNS to the effector organ.<br>
Effector Organs -It may be a muscle
or gland which responds to the impulse
received.<br>
There are two types of reflexes. They are <br>
**1) Unconditional reflex** is an inborn
reflex for an unconditioned stimulus.
It does not need any past experience,
knowledge or training to occur;
Ex: blinking of an eye when a dust
particle about to fall into it, sneezing
and coughing due to foreign particle
entering the nose or larynx.<br>
**2) Conditioned reflex** is a respone to a
stimulus that has been acquired by
learning. This does not naturally exists
in animals. Only an experience makes
it a part of the behaviour. Example:
excitement of salivary gland on seeing
and smelling a food. The conditioned
reflex was first demonstrated by the
Russian physiologist **Pavlov** in his
classical conditioning experiment in a
dog. The cerebral cortex controls the

**Peripheral Neural System (PNS)** <br>

![](/books/zoology/unit-4/neural-control-and-coordination/13.png)<br>
**Figure 10.12** Reflex arc <br>

PNS consists of all nervous tissue outside
the CNS. Components of PNS include
nerves, ganglia, enteric plexuses and
sensory receptors. A nerve is a chord like
structure that encloses several neurons
inside. Ganglia (singular-ganglion) are
small masses of nervous tissue, consisting
primarily of neuron cell bodies and are
located outside the brain and spinal cord.
Enteric plexuses are extensive networks of
neurons located in the walls of organs of the
gastrointestinal tract. The neurons of these
plexuses help in regulating the digestive
system. The specialized structure that helps
to respond to changes in the environment
i.e. stimuli are called **sensory receptor**
which triggers nerve impulses along the
afferent fibres to CNS. PNS comprises of
cranial nerves a ­ rising from the brain and
spinal nerves arising from the spinal cord.<br>
**(A) Cranial nerves:** There are 12 pairs
of cranial nerves, of which the first two
pairs arise from the fore brain and the
remaining 10 pairs from the mid brain.
Other than the Vagus nerve, which extends
into the abdomen, all cranial nerves serve
the head and face.<br>
**(B) Spinal nerves:** 31 pairs of spinal
nerves emerge out from the spinal cord
through spaces called the intervertebral
foramina found between the adjacent
vertebrae. The spinal nerves are named
according to the region of vertebral
column from which they originate two roots:1) a posterior dorsal root with
a ganglion outside the spinal cord and 2)
an anterior ventral root with no external
ganglion.<br>
i. Cervical nerves (8 pairs) <br>
ii. Thoracic nerves (12 pairs) <br>
iii. Lumbar nerves (5 pairs)<br>
iv. Sacral nerves (5 pairs)<br>
v. Coccygeal nerves (1 pair)<br>
Each spinal nerve is a mixed nerve
containing both afferent (sensory) and
efferent (motor) fibres. It originates as
two roots:1) a posterior dorsal root with
a ganglion outside the spinal cord and 2)
an anterior ventral root with no external
ganglion.

**Somatic neural system (SNS)** <br>
The **somatic neural system** (SNS or
voluntary neural system) is the part of the
peripheral neural system associated with
the voluntary control of body movements
via skeletal muscles. The sensory and motor
nerves that innervate striated muscles form
the somatic neural system. Major functions
of the somatic neural system include
voluntary movement of the muscles and
organs, and reflex movements.<br>
{{<box title="">}}
In adult, the total CSF volume is about
150 ml and is replaced every 8 hours.
About 500 ml of CSF is formed daily.
The choroid plexus helps cleanse the
CSF by removing waste products.
{{</box>}}

**Autonomic Neural System** <br>
The autonomic neural system is auto
functioning and self governed. It is a
part of peripheral neural system that
innervates smooth muscles, glands and
cardiac muscle. This system controls and
coordinates the involuntary activities of
various organs. ANS controlling centre is
in the hypothalamus.<br>
Autonomic neural system comprises
the following components:<br>

**Preganglionic neuron** whose cell
body is in the brain or spinal cord; its
myelinated axon exits the CNS as part
of cranial or spinal nerve and ends in an
autonomic ganglion.

**Autonomic ganglion** consists of axon
of preganglionic neuron and cell bodies of
postganglionic neuron <br>

**Postganglionic neuron** conveys nerve
impulses from autonomic ganglia to
visceral effector organs.<br>

The autonomic neural system
consists of **Sympathetic neural system**
and **Parasympathetic neural system.**

### 10.6 Sensory reception and processing <br>
Our senses make us aware of changes that
occur in our surroundings and also within
our body. **Sensation** [awareness of the
stimulus] and **perception** [interpretation of
the meaning of the stimulus] occur in the
brain. <br>
Receptors are classified based on their
location: **1. Exteroceptors** are ­
located at
or near the surface of the body. These are
sensitive to external stimuli and receive
sensory inputs for hearing, vision, touch, taste
and smell. **2. Interoceptors** are located in the
visceral organs and blood vessels. They are
sensitive to internal stimuli. **Proprioceptors**
are also a kind of ­interoceptors. They provide
information about position and movements
of the body. These are located in the skeletal
muscles, tendons, joints, ligaments and in
connective tissue coverings of bones and
muscles. Receptors based on the type of
stimulus are shown in Table 10.3.

**Table: 10.3** Types of receptors <br>
| **Receptors** 	| **Stimulus** 	| **Effector organs** 	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| Mechano receptors 	| Pressure and<br>vibration 	| Mechano receptors are present in the cochlea of the<br>inner ear and the semi circular canal and utriculus 	|
| Chemoreceptors 	| Chemicals 	| Taste buds in the tongue and nasal epithelium 	|
| Thermoreceptors 	| Temperature 	| Skin 	|
| Photoreceptors 	| Light 	| Rod and cone cells of the retina in the eye 	|


#### 10.6.1 Photoreceptor - Eye <br>
Eye is the organ of vision; located in the
orbit of the skull and held in its position
with the help of six extrinsic muscles. They
are **superior, inferior, lateral, median**
**rectus muscles, superior oblique** and
**inferior oblique muscles**. These muscles
aid in the movement of the eyes and they
receive their nerve innervation from III, IV
and VI cranial nerves. Eyelids, eye lashes
and eye brows are the accessory structures
useful in protecting the eyes. The eye lids
protect the eyes from excessive light and
foreign objects and spread lubricating
secretions over the eyeballs.<br>
Eyelashes and the eyebrows help to
protect the eyeballs from foreign objects,
perspiration and also from the direct rays
of sunlight. **Sebaceous glands** at the base
of the eyelashes are called **ciliary glands**
which secrete a lubricating fluid into the
hair follicles. **Lacrymal glands**, located
in the upper lateral region of each orbit,
secrete tears. Tears are secreted at the rate
of 1mL/day and it contains salts, mucus and
**lysozyme enzyme** to destroy bacteria.
The conjunctiva is a thin, protective
mucous membrane found lining the
outer surface of the eyeball (Figure 10.13).

![](/books/zoology/unit-4/neural-control-and-coordination/14.png)<br>
**Figure.10.13** The human eye <br>

The eye has two compartments, the
­ **anterior** and **posterior compartments**. The
anterior compartment has two chambers,
first one lies between the cornea and iris
and the second one lies between the iris
and lens. These two chambers are filled with
watery fluid called **aqueous humor**. The
posterior compartment lies between the
lens and retina and it is filled with a jelly
like fluid called **vitreous humor** that helps
to retain the spherical nature of the eye. **Eye**
**lens** is transparent and biconvex, made up
of long columnar epithelial cells called **lens**
**fibres**. These cells are accumulated with the
proteins called **crystalline**

**The eye ball** <br>
The eye ball is spherical in nature. The
anterior one- sixth of the eyeball is exposed;
the remaining region is fitted well into the
orbit. The wall of the eye ball consists of three
layers: fibrous **Sclera**, vascular **Choroid** and
sensory Retina (Figure 10.14).<br>
The outer coat is composed of dense
non-vascular connective tissue. It has
two regions: the anterior **cornea** and the
posterior **sclera**. Cornea is a non-vascular
transparent coat formed of stratified
squamous epithelium which helps the
cornea to renew continuously as it is very
vulnerable to damage from dust. Sclera
forms the white of the eye and protects the
eyeball. Posteriorly the sclera is innervated
by the optic nerve. At the junction of the
sclera and the cornea, is a channel called
‘**canal of schlemm**’ which continuously
drains out the excess of aqueous humor.

{{<box title="Do you Know">}}
Dilation and congestion
of the blood vessels of the
conjunctiva due to local
irritation or infection are
the cause of bloodshot
eye (conjunctivitis - commonly called
Madras eye). Infection of ciliary glands
by bacteria causes a painful, pus filled
swelling called a Sty.
{{</box>}}

{{<box title="">}}
The cornea is the only tissue in the
body that can be transplanted from
one person to another with little or no
possibility of rejection. This is because
cornea does not have blood vessels.
{{</box>}}

**Choroid** is highly vascularized
pigmented layer that nourishes all the
eye layers and its pigments absorb
light to prevent internal reflection.
Anteriorly the choroid thickens to form
the ciliary body and iris. Iris is the
coloured portion of the eye lying between
the cornea and lens. The aperture at the
centre of the iris is the **pupil** through
which the light enters the inner chamber.
Iris is made of two types of muscles the
**dilator papillae** (the radial muscle) and
the **sphincter papillae** (the circular
muscle).In the bright light, the circular
muscle in the iris contract; so that the size
of pupil decreases and less light enters
the eye. In dim light, the radial muscle
in the iris contract; so that the pupil size
increases and more light enters the eye.
Smooth muscle present in the ciliary
body is called the **ciliary muscle** which
alters the convexity of the lens for near
and far vision. The ability of the eyes to
focus objects at varying distances is called
**accommodation** which is achieved by <br>
![](/books/zoology/unit-4/neural-control-and-coordination/15.png)<br>
**Figure 10.14** L.S. of the eye <br>

**Retina** forms the inner most layer
of the eye and it contains two regions:
A sheet of **pigmented epithelium** (non
visual part) and **neural visual regions**.
The neural retina layer contains three
types of cells: photoreceptor cells –
**cones and rods** (Figure 10.15 and Table
10.4), **bipolar cells and ganglion cells**.
**suspensory ligament, ciliary muscle and**
**ciliary body**. The suspensory ligament
extends from the ciliary body and helps
to hold the lens in its upright position.
The ciliary body is provided with blood
capillaries that secrete a watery fluid
called **aqueous humor** that fills the
anterior chamber.<br>
![](/books/zoology/unit-4/neural-control-and-coordination/16.png)<br>
**Figure 10.15** Rod and Cone cells <br>
The yellow flat spot at the centre of the
posterior region of the retina is called
macula lutea which is responsible for
sharp detailed vision. A small depression
present in the centre of the yellow spot
is called fovea centralis which contains
only cones. The optic nerves and the
retinal blood vessels enter the eye slightly

**Table: 10.4** Differences between rod and cone cells <br>
| **Rod cells** 	| **Cone cells** 	|
|---	|---	|
| Rods are responsible for vision in dim light 	| The cones are responsible for colour vision<br>and works best in the bright light. 	|
| The pigment present in the rods is rhodopsin,<br>formed of a protein scotopsin and retinal<br>(an aldehyde of vitamin A ) 	| The pigment present in the cones is<br>photopsin, formed of opsin protein and<br>retinal. 	|
| There are about 120 millions rod cells 	| There may be 6-7 millions cone cells 	|
| Rods are predominant in the extra fovea region 	| Cones are concentrated in the fovea region 	|

below the posterior pole, which is devoid
of photo receptors; hence this region is
called **blind spot.**

**Mechanism of vision** <br>
When light enters the
eyes, it gets refracted
by the **cornea, aqueous**
**humor and lens and it**
**is focused** on the retina
and excites the rod and
cone cells. The photo pigment consists
of **Opsin**, the protein part and **Retinal,**
a derivative of vitamin A. Light induces
dissociation of retinal from opsin and
causes the structural changes in opsin.
This generates an action potential in the
photoreceptor cells and is transmitted by
the optic nerves to the visual cortex of the
brain, via bipolar cells, ganglia and optic
nerves, for the perception of vision.

**Refractive errors of eye**
**Myopia** (near sightedness): The affected
person can see the nearby objects but
not the distant objects. This condition
may result due to an elongated eyeball or
thickened lens; so that the image of distant
object is formed in front of the yellow spot. This error can be corrected using concave lens that
diverge the entering
light rays and focuses it
on the retina.

**Hypermetropia** <br>
(long sightedness): the
affected person can
see only the distant
objects clearly but not the objects nearby. This condition results due to a shortened eyeball and
thin lens; so the image of closest object is
converged behind the retina. This defect
can be overcome by using convex lens that
converge the entering light rays on the
retina.<br>
**Presbyopia:** Due to aging, the
lens loses elasticity and the power of
accommodation. Convex lenses are used
to correct this defect. <br>
**Astigmatism** is due to the rough
(irregular) curvature of cornea or lens.
Cylindrical glasses are used to correct this
error (Figure 10.16).<br>
**Cataract:** Due to the changes in nature
of protein, the lens becomes opaque. It
can be corrected by surgical procedures.

{{<box title="">}}
Visual pigments for colour vision
are i) the red cones having the visual
pigment, Erythropsin is sensitive to
long wavelength close to 560 nm.
ii) The green cones having the pigment,
chloropsin is sensitive to medium
wavelength of 530 nm iii) the blue
cones having the pigment, cyanopsin
is sensitive to short wavelength of
420 nm.

Aqueous humour supplies nutrients
and oxygen to the lens, cornea and
some retinal cells. The aqueous humor
is produced and drained at the same
rate, maintaining a constant intra ocular
pressure of about 16 mmHg. Any block
in the canal of schlemm increases the
infra ocular pressure of aqueous humor
and leads to ‘Glaucoma’ where the optic
nerve and the retina are compressed
due to pressure.

#### 10.6.2 Phonoreceptor <br>
The ear is the site of reception of two
senses namely hearing and equilibrium.
Anatomically, the ear is divided into three
regions: the external ear, the middle ear and
internal ear.<br>
The external ear consists of **pinna**,
**external auditory meatus** and **ear drum.** The
pinna is flap of elastic cartilage covered by
skin. It collects the sound waves. The external
auditory meatus is a curved tube that extends
up to the tympanic membrane [the ear drum].
The tympanic membrane is composed of

![](/books/zoology/unit-4/neural-control-and-coordination/18.png)<br>
**Figure 10.17** Path of Sound wave <br>

connective tissues covered with skin outside
and with mucus membrane inside.<br>
There are very fine hairs and wax producing
sebaceous glands called **ceruminous glands** in
the external auditory meatus. The combination
of hair and the **ear wax** [cerumen] helps in
preventing dust and foreign particles from
entering the ear.<br>
The **middle ear** is a small air-filled cavity
in the temporal bone. It is separated from
the external ear by the eardrum and from
the internal ear by a thin bony partition; the
bony partition contains two small membrane
covered openings called the oval window and
the round window.<br>
The middle ear contains three ossicles:
**malleus** [hammer bone], **incus** [anvil bone]
and **stapes** [stirrup bone] which are attached
to one another. The malleus is attached to the
tympanic membrane and its head articulates
with the incus which is the intermediate
bone lying between the malleus and stapes.
The stapes is attached to the oval window in
the inner ear. The ear ossicles transmit sound
waves to the inner ear. A tube called Eustachian
tube connects the middle ear cavity with the
pharynx. This tube helps in
equalizing the pressure of air on either sides of the ear
drum.<br>
**Inner ear** is the fluid filled
cavity consisting of two parts,
the bony labyrinth and the
membranous labyrinths. The bony labyrinth consists of
three areas: **cochlea,** vestibule
and semicircular canals. The cochlea is a coiled portion
consisting of 3 chambers
namely: scala vestibuli and
scala tympani- these two
are filled with perilymph;
and the scala media is filled
with endolymph. At the base of the cochlea,
the scala vestibule ends at the ‘oval window’
whereas the scala tympani ends at the ‘round
window’ of the middle ear. The chambers
scala vestibuli and scala media are separated
by a membrane called Reisner’s membrane
whereas the scala media and scala tympani
are separated by a membrane called Basilar
membrane (Figure 10.17)

**Organ of Corti** <br>
The **organ of Corti** (Figure.10.18) is a
sensory ridge located on the top of **the Basilar**
**membrane** and it contains numerous hair
cells that are arranged in four rows along the
length of the basilar membrane. Protruding
from the apical part of each hair cell is hair
like structures known as **stereocilia**. During
the conduction of sound wave, stereocilia
makes a contact with the stiff gel membrane
called **tectorial membrane**, a roof like
structure overhanging the organ of corti
throughout its length.

**Mechanism of hearing** <br>
Sound waves entering the external auditory
meatus fall on the tympanic membrane.
This causes the ear drum to vibrate, and
these vibrations are transmitted to the
oval window through the three auditory
ossicles. Since the tympanic membrane is
17-20 times larger than the oval window,
the pressure exerted on the oval window
is about 20 times more than that on the
tympanic membrane. This increased
pressure generates pressure waves in the
fluid of perilymph. This pressure causes
the round window to alternately bulge
outward and inward meanwhile the basilar
membrane along with the organ of Corti
move up and down. These movements of
the hair alternately open and close the
mechanically gated ion channels in the
base of hair cells and the action potential is
propagated to the brain as sound sensation
through cochlear nerve.

![](/books/zoology/unit-4/neural-control-and-coordination/19.png)<br>
**Figure 10.18** Organ of Corti <br>

**Defects of Ear** <br>
Deafness may be temporary or permanent.
It can be further classified into **conductive**
**deafness** and **sensory-neural deafness**.
Possible causes for conductive deafness
may be due to <br>
i. the blockage of ear canal with earwax,<br>
ii. Rupture of eardrum <br>
iii. Middle ear infection accumulation with fluid<br>
iv. Restriction of ossicular movement.In
**sensory-neural deafness**, the defect
may be in the organ of Corti or the
auditory nerve or in the ascending
auditory pathways or auditory cortex.

**Organ of Equilibrium** <br>
Balance is part of a sense called
proprioception, which is the ability to sense
the position, orientation and movement of
the body. The organ of balance is known
as the **vestibular system** which is located
in the inner ear next to the cochlea. The
vestibular system is composed of a series
of fluid filled sacs and tubules.These sacs
and tubules contain endolymph and are
kept in the surrounding perilymph (Figure
10.19). These two fluids, perilymph and
endolymph, respond to the mechanical
forces, during changes occurring in body
position and acceleration.

![](/books/zoology/unit-4/neural-control-and-coordination/20.png)<br>
**Figure 10.19** Organ of Equilibrium <br>

{{<box title="">}}
Name the parts of the organ of
equilibrium involved in the following
functions.<br>
a)	Linear movement of the body <br>
b) Changes in the body position <br>
c) Rotational movement of the head.<br>
{{</box>}}

The utricle and saccule are two
membranous sacs, found nearest the
cochlea and contain equilibrium receptor
regions called **maculae** that are involved
in detecting the linear movement of the
head. The maculae contain the hair cells
that act as mechanorecptors. These hair
cells are embeded in a gelatinous otolithic
membrane that contains small calcareous
particles called **otoliths**. This membrane
adds weight to the top of the hair cells and
increase the inertia.<br>
The canals that lie posterior and lateral
to the vestibule are semicircular canals;
they are **anterior, posterior and lateral**
**canals** oriented at right angles to each
other. At one end of each semicircular
canal, at its lower end has a swollen area
called **ampulla**. Each ampulla has a sensory
area known as **crista ampullaris** which is
formed of sensory hair cells and supporting
cells. The function of these canals is to
detect rotational movement of the head.

{{<box title="">}}
The intensity of sound is measured in
decibels (dB). 0 dB is the threshold of
hearing for normal ear. Severe hearing
loss occurs with frequent or prolonged
exposure to sound with intensities
greater than 90dB. For meaningful
conversations the intensity should be
in the 50 dB range.
{{</box>}}

#### 10.6.3 Olfactory receptors <br>
The receptors for taste and smell are the
chemoreceptors. The smell receptors are
excited by air borne chemicals that dissolve
in fluids. The yellow coloured patches of
olfactory epithelium form the olfactory
organs that are located on the roof of the
nasal cavity. The olfactory epithelium is
covered by a thin coat of mucus layer below
and olfactory glands bounded connective
tissues, above. It contains three types of
cells: **supporting cells, Basal cells** and
millions of pin shaped **olfactory receptor**
**cells** (which are unusual bipolar cells). The
olfactory glands and the supporting cells
secrete the mucus. The unmyelinated axons
of the olfactory receptor cells are gathered
to form the filaments of olfactory nerve
[cranial nerve I] which synapse with cells
of olfactory bulb. The impulse, through the
olfactory nerves, is transmitted to the frontal

**Figure 10.20** Gustatory receptor <br>
lobe of the brain for identification of smell
and the limbic system for the emotional
responses to odour.<br>
**Gustatory receptor**: The sense of taste is
considered to be the most pleasurable of all
senses. The tongue is provided with many
small projections called **papillae** which give the
tongue an abrasive feel. Taste buds are located
mainly on the papillae which are scattered

{{<box title="">}}
The taste bud cells are subjected to
huge amounts of friction, because
of their location and are routinely
burned by hot foods. These are the
most dynamic cells in the body and
are replaced every seven to ten days.

over the entire tongue surface. Most taste buds
are seen on the tongue (Figure 10.20) few are
scattered on the soft palate, inner surface of the
cheeks, pharynx and epiglottis of the larynx.
Taste buds are flask-shaped and consist of 50 –
100 epithelial cells of two major types.
**Gustatory epithelial cells **(taste cells) and
**Basal epithelial cells** (Repairing cells) Long
microvilli called **gustatory hairs** project from
the tip of the gustatory cells and
extends through a taste pore to the
surface of the epithelium where
they are bathed by saliva. Gustatory
hairs are the sensitive portion of the
gustatory cells and they have sensory
dendrites which send the signal to
the brain. The basal cells that act as
stem cells, divide and differentiate
into new gustatory cells (Figure
10.20).<br>
**Skin-Sense of touch**
Skin is the sensory organ of touch and
is also the largest sense organ. This

![](/books/zoology/unit-4/neural-control-and-coordination/23.png)<br>
**Figure 10.21** Skin receptors <br>
sensation comes from millions of microscopic
sensory receptors located all over the skin
and associated with the general sensations of
contact, pressure, heat, cold and pain. Some
parts of the body, such as the finger tips have a
large number of these receptors, making them
more sensitive. Some of the sensory receptors
present in the skin (Figure 10.21) are:

• **Tactile merkel disc** is light touch
receptor lying in the deeper layer of
epidermis.<br>
• **Hair follicle receptors** are light touch
receptors lying around the hair follicles.<br>
• **Meissner’s corpuscles** are small light
pressure receptors found just beneath
the epidermis in the dermal papillae.
They are numerous in hairless skin areas
such as finger tips and soles of the feet.<br>
• **Pacinian corpuscles** are the large
egg shaped receptors found scattered
deep in the dermis and monitoring
vibration due to pressure. It allows to
detect different textures, temperature,
hardness and pain <br>
• **Ruffini endings** which lie in the dermis
responds to continuous pressure.<br>
• **Krause end bulbs** are thermoreceptors
that sense temperature.<br>

{{<box title="">}}
Melanocytes are the cells responsible for
producing the skin pigment, melanin, which
gives skin its colour and protects it from the
sun's UV rays. Vitiligo (Leucoderma) is a
condition in which the melanin pigment
is lost from areas of the skin, causing white
patches, often with no clear cause. Vitiligo
is not contagious. It can affect people of any
age, gender, or ethnic group. The patches
appear when melanocytes fails to synthesis
melanin pigment.

#### Summary <br>

Neural system coordinates and integrates
the functions of all organs and responds
to changes in the internal and external
environments.
Neural system includes two types of
cells neurons and neuroglia. Neuron
forms the structural and functional unit
of the neural system.
CNS includes brain and spinal cord. The
major parts of the brain are the cerebrum,
diencephalon, cerebellum and the brain
stem. The brain is protected by the cranium
and meninges. CSF provides mechanical
protection and nutrients to the CNS.
The spinal cord is the continuation
of the medulla oblongata and ends at
the second lumbar vertebra as conus
medullaris. The components involved in
reflex action are called reflex arc.
There are 12 pairs of cranial nerves
which arise from the brain and 31 pairs of
spinal nerves from the spinal cord make
the PNS. The PNS is further divided into
Somatic Neural system and Autonomic
Neural system. The SNS operates under
conscious control. The ANS usually
operates unconsciously.
The motor portion of ANS has
two major divisions: sympathetic and
parasympathetic.
Sensation is the conscious or
subconscious awareness of changes in the
external or internal environment. Four
events namely stimulation, transduction,
generation of impulses and integration
occurs typically for a sensation to take
place.
Simple receptors are associated with
the general senses such as somatic senses
(skin); complex receptors are associated
with the special senses such as smell, taste,
vision, hearing and equilibrium.

  #### Nervous System 
The Nervous system is a complex collection of specialized nerve cells known as neurons
that transmit signals between different parts of the body.
