Did you ever wonder how our body
functions? The body maintains a
stable condition even when the outside
environment changes; Our eyes help to
see things around us; Ears help us to hear
various sounds; Heart beats continuously
and rhythmically; Air goes in and out of
lungs; Eyes shed tears when our limbs get
hurt. Each cell of the body works in a
coordinated manner. Do you know how it
is coordinated and controlled?


The neural system of our body
coordinates all the other systems to work
together effectively and smoothly. Every
second, diverse functions in our body are
performed by the neural system. Day and
night, millions of messages pass as stimuli
through the cells of the neural system
to stimulate the heart to beat; kidney to
excrete waste; and mouth to relish the
delicious food. An even more remarkable
feature of the neural system is its ability to
respond simultaneously to several stimuli,
for instance, we can play piano and sing;
listen to music and do household chores. In
all such coordinated movements, whether
skilled performances or routine tasks like
cycling or driving, the integrating power
of the neural system is involved. In this
chapter, you will understand how neural
system is organized; how it integrates all
organs and what kind of cellular events
underlie its functioning.


#### 10.1 Neural system

The neural system comprises of highly
specialized cells called neurons, which
can detect, receive, process and transmit
different kinds of stimuli. Simple form of
neural system as nerve net is seen in lower
invertebrates. The neural system of higher
animals are well developed and performs
the following basic functions:

• Sensory functions- It receives sensory
input from internal and external
environment.


• Motor functions- It transmits motor
commands from the brain to the
skeletal and muscular system.


• Autonomic functions- Reflex actions.


#### 10.2 Human Neural System


The human neural system is divided into
two, **the central neural system (CNS)**
and **the peripheral neural system (PNS)**.
The structural and functional units of the
neural system are neurons that transmit
nerve impulses. The non-nervous special
cells called **neuroglia** form the supporting
cells of the nervous tissue.

There are three functional classes of
neurons. They are the **afferent neurons**
that take sensory impulses to the Central
Neural system (CNS) from the sensory
organs; the **efferent neurons** that carry
motor impulses from the CNS to the
effector organs; and **interneurons** that
lie entirely within the CNS between the
afferent and efferent neurons.


The central neural system lacks
connective tissue, so the interneuron
space is filled by neuroglia. They perform
several functions such as providing
nourishment to the surrounding neurons;
involving the memory process; repairing
the injured tissues due to their dividing
and regenerating capacity; and acting
as phagocyte cells to engulf the foreign
particles at the time of any injury to the
brain.

{{< box title="" type="objective" >}}

Glial cells do not lose the ability to
undergo cell division; so most brain
tumours of neural origin consists of
glial cells. Neurons themselves do not
form tumours because they are unable
to divide and multiply.

#### 10.3 Neuron as a structural and functional unit of Neural system

A neuron is a microscopic structure
composed of three major parts namely **cell**
**body (soma), dendrites and axon.** The
cell body is the spherical part of the neuron
that contains all the cellular organelles
as a typical cell (except centriole). The
plasma membrane covering the neuron
is called **neurilemma** and the axon is
**axolemma.** The repeatedly branched
short fibres coming out of the cell body
are called **dendrites**, which transmit
impulses towards the cell body. The cell
body and the dendrites contain cytoplasm
and granulated endoplasmic reticulum
called **Nissl’s granules**.


An axon is a long fibre that arises from
a cone shaped area of the cell body called
the Axon hillock and ends at the branched
distal end. **Axon hillock** is the place where
the nerve impulse is generated in the
motor neurons. The axon of one-neuron
branches and forms connections with
many other neurons. An axon contains
the same organelles found in the dendrites
and cell body but lacks Nissl’s granules
and Golgi apparatus.


![neural](/books/biology/unit-4/neural/pic2.png )

The axon, particularly of peripheral
nerves is surrounded by **Schwann cells**
(a type of glial cell) to form myelin
sheath, which act as an insulator. **Myelin**
**sheath** is associated only with the axon;
dendrites are always non-myelinated.
Schwann cells are not continuous alongthe axon; 
so there are gaps in the myelin
sheath between adjacent Schwann
cells. These gaps are called **Nodes of**
**Ranvier**. Large myelinated nerve fibres
conduct impulses rapidly, whereas non-
myelinated fibres conduct impulses quite
slowly (Figure 10.1).


{{< box title="" type="objective" >}}


The longest cells in the human body
are the **neurons**. The **longest axons**
in the **human body**, for example, are
those of the sciatic nerve, which run
from the base of the spine to the big
toe of each foot. These single-cell
fibers may extend a meter or even
longer. The axons of the inter neurons
in the CNS are the shortest.

{{< /box >}}


Each branch at the distal end of the axon
terminates into a bulb like structure called
**synaptic knob** which possesses **synaptic**
**vesicles** filled with **neurotransmitters**.
The axon transmits nerve impulses away
from the cell body to an **inter neural**
space or to a **neuro-muscular junction**.
The neurons are divided into three
types based on number of axon and
dendrites they possess (Figure.10.2).

1. **Multipolar neurons** have many
processes with one axon and two or more
dendrites. They are mostly interneurons.

2. **Bipolar neurons** have two processes
with one axon and one dendrite. These are
found in the retina of the eye, inner ear
and the olfactory area of the brain.

3. **Unipolar neurons** have a single short
process and one axon. Unipolar neurons
are located in the ganglia of cranial and
spinal nerves.

#### 10.3.1 Generation and conduction of nerve impulses

This section deals with how the nerve
impulses are produced and conducted in
our body. Sensation felt in the sensory
organs are carried by the nerve fibres in
the form of electrical impulses. A nerve
impulse is a series of electrical impulses,
which travel along the nerve fibre. Inner
to the axolemma, the cytoplasm contains
the **intracellular fluid (ICF)** with large
amounts of potassium and magnesium
phosphate along with negatively charged
proteins and other organic molecules.The
**extra cellular fluid (ECF)** found outside
the axolemma contains large amounts of
sodium chloride, bicarbonates, nutrients
and oxygen for the cell; and carbon dioxide
and metabolic wastes released by the
neuronal cells. The ECF and ICF (cytosol)
contains negatively charged particles
(anions) and positively charged particles
(cations). These charged particles are
involved in the conduction of impulses.

The neurons maintain an uneven
distribution of various inorganic ions 
across their axolemma for transmission
of impulses. This unequal distribution of
ions establishes the membrane potential
across the axolemma. The axolemma
contains a variety of membrane proteins
that act as ionic channels and regulates the
movement of ions across the axolemma.
(Shown in Table 10.1).

#### 10.3.2 Transmission of impulses

The transmission of impulse involves two
main phases; **Resting membrane potential**
and **Action membrane potential**.

**Resting membrane Potential**: The
electrical potential difference across the
plasma membrane of a resting neuron is
called the **resting potential** during which
the interior of the cell is negative due to
greater efflux of K+ outside the cell than


{{< box title="" type="objective" >}}

Note: The charged particles have
potential energy. The potential dif-
ference is the measure of potential
energy between two points which is
measured in volts or millivolts.

Na<sup>+</sup> influx into the cell. When the axon is
not conducting any impulses i.e. in resting
condition, the axon membrane is more
permeable to K<sup>+</sup> and less permeable to Na+
ions, whereas it remains impermeable to
negatively charged protein ions.


![neural](/books/biology/unit-4/neural/pic4.png )

The axoplasm contains high
concentration of K<sup>+</sup> and negatively
charged proteins and low concentration
of Na<sup>+</sup> ions. In contrast, fluid outside the
axon (ECF) contains low concentration
of K<sup>+</sup> and high concentration of
Na+, and this forms a concentration
gradient. This ionic gradient
across the resting membrane is
maintained by ATP driven Sodium-
Potassium pump, which exchanges
3Na<sup>+</sup>outwards for 2K<sup>+</sup>into 
the cells.

In this state, the cell membrane is
said to be polarized. In neuron, the
resting membrane potential ranges
from -40mV to -90mV, and its
normal value is -70mV. The minus
sign indicates that the inside of the
cell is negative with respect to the
outside (Figure 10.4).

![neural](/books/biology/unit-4/neural/pic5.png )


##### Action membrane potential

An action potential occurs when a neuron
sends information down an axon, away
from the cell body. It includes following
phases, depolarization, repolarisation and
hypo polarization.

##### Depolarization – Reversal of polarity

When a nerve fibre is stimulated,
**sodium voltage-gate opens** and makes
the **axolemma** permeable to Na<sup>+</sup> ions;
meanwhile the potassium voltage gate
closes. As a result, the rate of flow of Na<sup>+</sup>
ions into the axoplasm exceeds the rate of
flow of K<sup>+</sup> ions to the outside fluid [ECF].
Therefore, the axolemma becomes positively
charged inside and negatively charged
outside. This reversal of electrical charge is
called Depolarization.

During depolarization, when enough
Na<sup>+</sup> ions enter the cell, the action
potential reaches a certain level,
called threshold potential [-55mV].
The particular stimulus which is able
to bring the membrane potential
to threshold is called threshold
stimulus.


The action potential occurs in
response to a threshold stimulus
but does not occur at subthreshold
stimuli. This is called all or none
principle. Due to the rapid influx
of Na<sup>+</sup> ions, the membrane potential
shoots rapidly up to +45mV which is called
the Spike potential.

**Repolarisation [Falling Phase]**

When the membrane reaches the spike
potential, the **sodium voltage-gate closes**
and **potassium voltage-gate opens**. It
checks influx of Na<sup>+</sup> ions and initiates the
efflux of K<sup>+</sup>ions which lowers the number
of positive ions within the cell. Thus, the
potential falls back towards the resting
potential. The reversal of membrane
potential inside the axolemma to negative
occurs due to the efflux of K<sup>+</sup> ions. This is
called Repolarisation.

**Hyperpolarization**

If repolarization becomes more negative
than the resting potential -70 mV to about
-90 mV, it is called **Hyperpolarization**.


![neural](/books/biology/unit-4/neural/pic5.png )

During this, K<sup>+</sup> ion gates are more permeable
to K<sup>+</sup> even after reaching the threshold level
as it closes slowly; hence called Lazy gates.
The membrane potential returns to its
original resting state when K+ ion channels
close completely. During hyperpolarization
the Na<sup>+</sup> voltage gate remains closed (Figure
10.5).


**Conduction Speed of a nerve impulse**

The conduction speed of a nerve impulse
depends on the diameter of axon. The
greater the axon’s diameter, the faster is the
conduction. The myelinated axon conducts
the impulse faster than the non-myelinated
axon. The voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels
are concentrated at the nodes of Ranvier.
As a result, the impulse jumps node to node,
rather than travelling the entire length of the
nerve fibre. This mechanism of conduction
is called Saltatory Conduction. Nerve
impulses travel at the speed of 1-300 m/s.

##### 10.3.3 Synaptic transmission

The junction between two neurons is
called a **Synapse** through which a nerve
impulse is transmitted. The first neuron
involved in the synapse forms the **pre-**
**synaptic neuron** and the second neuron
is **the post-synaptic neuron.** A small
gap between the pre and postsynaptic
membranes is called **Synaptic Cleft** that
forms a structural gap and a functional
bridge between neurons. The axon
terminals contain synaptic vesicles
filled with **neurotransmitters**. When an
impulse [action potential] arrives at the
axon terminals, it depolarizes the pre-
synaptic membrane, opening the voltage
gated calcium channels. Influx of calcium
ions stimulates the synaptic vesicles
towards the pre-synaptic membrane and
fuses with it. In the neurilemma, the
vesicles release their neurotransmitters
into the synaptic cleft by **exocytosis**. The
released neurotransmitters bind to their
specific receptors on the post-synaptic
membrane, responding to chemical
signals. The entry of the ions can generate
a new potential in the post-synaptic
neuron, which may be either **excitatory**
or **inhibitory.** Excitatory post-synaptic
potential causes depolarization whereas
inhibitory post-synaptic potential causes
**hyperpolarization** of post-synaptic
membrane (Figure 10.6).

### 10.4 Central neural system (CNS)

The CNS includes the brain and the
spinal cord, which are protected by the
bones of the skull and vertebral column.
During its embryonic development, CNS
develops from the ectoderm.


{{< box title="" type="objective" >}}

Can you state why some areas of the
brain and spinal cord are grey and some
are white?

{{< /box >}}


##### 10.4.1 Brain

The brain acts as the command and
control system. It is the site of information
processing. It is located in the cranial cavity
and is covered by three cranial meninges.
The outer thick layer is **Duramater** which
lines the inner surface of the cranial cavity;
the median thin layer is **Arachnoid mater**
which is separated from the duramater by
a narrow **subdural space**. The innermost
layer is **Piamater** which is closely adhered to
the brain but separated from the arachnoid
mater by the **subarachnoid space**. The
brain is divided into three major regions:
Forebrain, Midbrain and Hindbrain.

**Fore Brain**


It comprises the following regions:
**Cerebrum** and **Diencephalon**. Cerebrum
is the ‘seat of intelligence’ and forms the
major part of the brain. The cerebrum
consists of an outer cortex, inner medulla
and **basal nuclei**. The superficial region
of the cerebrum is called **cerebral cortex**,
which looks grey due to the presence of
unmyelinated nerve cells. Cerebral cortex
consists of neuronal cell body, dendrites,
associated glial and blood vessels. The
surface of the cerebrum shows many
convolutions (folds) and grooves. The
folds are called **gyri** (singular gyrus); the
shallow grooves between the gyri are called
**sulci** (singular sulcus) and deep grooves are
called fissures. These sulci and gyri increase
the surface area of the cerebral cortex.
Several sulci divide the cerebrum into
eight lobes: a pair of **frontals, parietals,**
**temporals and occipital lobes** (Figure10.7
& Table 10.2).


A median longitudinal fissure divides
the cerebrum longitudinally into two
cerebral hemispheres (Figure 10.7). A
transverse fissure separates the cerebral
hemispheres from the cerebellum. The
hemispheres are connected by a tract
of nerve fibres called **corpus callosum**.
Cerebral cortex has three functional areas
namely **sensory areas** occur in the parietal,
temporal and occipital lobes of the cortex.
They receive and interpret the sensory
impulses. **Motor area** of the cortex which
controls voluntary muscular movements
lies in the posterior part of the frontal lobes.
The areas other than sensory and motor
areas are called **Association areas** that deal
with integrative functions such as memory,
communications, learning and reasoning.
Inner to the cortex is **medulla** which is
white in colour and acts as a nerve tract
between the cortex and the diencephalon.

**Diencephalon** consists largely of
following three paired structures.

**Epithalamus** forms the roof of the
diencephalon and it is a non-nervous tissue.


The anterior part of epithalamus is vascular
and folded to form the anterior **choroid**
**plexus**. Just behind the choroid plexus, the
epithalamus forms a short stalk which ends
in a rounded body called **pineal body** which
secretes the hormone, **melatonin** which
regulates sleep and wake cycle.

**Thalamus** is composed of grey
mater which serves as a relay centre for
impulses between the spinal cord, brain
stem and cerebrum. Within the thalamus,
information is sorted and edited and plays
a key role inlearning and memory. It is a
major coordinating centre for sensory and
motor signalling.


{{< box title="" type="objective" >}}


Human brain is formed of a large
number of parts like cerebrum, thalamus,
hypothalamus, pons, cerebellum and
medulla oblongata. Each part performs
some specialized function and all the parts
are essential for the survival of a person.
Discuss the following statements :

a) Thalami are called relay centres of
the brain.

b) Damage to medulla may cause the
death of organism.

{{< /box >}}


![neural](/books/biology/unit-4/neural/pic9.png )


**Hypothalamus** forms the floor of the
diencephalon. The downward extension
of the hypothalamus, the **infundibulum**
connects the hypothalamus with the pituitary
gland. The hypothalamus contains a pair of
small rounded body called **mammillary**
**bodies** that are involved in olfactory
reflexes and emotional responses to odour.
Hypothalamus maintains homeostasis and
has many centres which control the body
temperature, urge for eating and drinking.
It also contains a group of neurosecretory
cells which secrete the hypothalamic
hormones. Hypothalamus also acts as the
**satiety centre.**

{{< box title="" type="objective" >}}

Depression is a functional deficiency
of seratonin or norepinephrine or
both. This disorder is characterized
by a pervasive negative mood, loss
of interest, an inability to experience
pleasure and suicidal tendencies.
Antidepressant drugs increase the
available concentration of these
neurotransmitters in the CNS. Hence
depression is treatable.

{{< /box >}}


**Limbic system**

The inner part of the cerebral
hemisphere constitutes the limbic
system. The main components of limbic
system are **olfactory bulbs, cingulate**
**gyrus, mammillary body, amygdala,**
**hippocampus and hypothalamus**.
The limbic system is called ‘emotional
brain’ because it plays a primary role in
the regulation of pleasure, pain, anger,
fear, sexual feeling and affection. The
hippocampus and amygdala also play a
role in memory (Figure 10.9).


**Brain stem** is the part of the brain between
the spinal cord and the diencephalon. It
consists of mid brain, pons varolii and
medulla oblongata (Figure 10.10).


![neural](/books/biology/unit-4/neural/pic10.png )

**Mid brain**

The mid brain is located between the
diencephalon and the pons. The lower
portion of the midbrain consists of a
pair of longitudinal bands of nervous
tissue called **cerebral peduncles** which
relay impulses back and forth between
cerebrum, cerebellum, pons and medulla.
The dorsal portion of the midbrain consists
of four rounded bodies called **corpora**
**quadrigemina** which acts as a reflex centre
for vision and hearing.

**Hind brain**

Rhombencephalon forms the hind brain.
It comprises of cerebellum, pons varolii
and medulla oblongata. **Cerebellum** is

![neural](/books/biology/unit-4/neural/pic11.png )

the second largest part of the brain. It
consists of two **cerebellar hemispheres**
and central worm shaped part, **the vermis**.
The cerebellum controls and coordinates
muscular movements and body
equilibrium. Any damage to cerebellum
often results in uncoordinated voluntary
muscle movements.

**Pons varoli** lies infront of the
cerebellum between the midbrain and the
medulla oblongata. The nerve fibres in the
pons varolii form a bridge between the two
cerebellar hemispheres and connect the
medulla oblongata with the other region
of the brain. The respiratory nuclei found
in the pons cooperate withthe medulla to
control respiration.

**Medulla oblongata** forms the posterior
most part of the brain. It connects the spinal
cord with various parts of the brain. It
receives and integrates signals from spinal
cord and sends it to the cerebellum and
thalamus. Medulla contains vital centres
that control cardio vascular reflexes,
respiration and gastric secretions.

**Ventricles of the brain**

The brain has four hollow, fluid filled
spaces. The C- shaped space found
inside each cerebral hemisphere forms
the lateral **ventricles I and II** which
are separated from each other by a thin
membrane calledthe **septum pellucidum**.
Each lateral ventricle communicates
with the narrow III ventricle in the
diencephalon through an opening called
**interventricular foramen (foramen of**
**Monro)**. The ventricle III is continuous
with the ventricle IV in the hind brain
through a canal called **aqueduct of**
**Sylvius** **(cerebral aqueduct)**. Choroid
plexus is a network of blood capillaries
found in the roof of the ventricles and
forms **cerebro spinal fluid (CSF)** from
the blood. CSF provides buoyancy to
the CNS structures; CSF acts as a shock
absorber for the brain and spinal cord; it
nourishes the brain cells by transporting
constant supply of food and oxygen; it
carries harmful metabolic wastes from
the brain to the blood; and maintains
a constant pressure inside the cranial
vessels.

<h5> <b> 10.4.2 Spinal cord </b> </h5>

The spinal cord is a long, slender, cylindrical
nervous tissue. It is protected by the
vertebral column and surrounded by the
three membranes as in the brain. The spinal
cord that extends from the brain stem into
the vertebral canal of the vertebral column
up to the level of 1st or 2nd lumbar vertebra.
So the nerve roots of the remaining nerves
are greatly elongated to exit the vertebral
column at their appropriate space. The
thick bundle of elongated nerve roots
within the lower vertebral canal is called
the **cauda equina** (horse’s tail) because of
its appearance.


![neural](/books/biology/unit-4/neural/pic12.png )

In the cross section of spinal cord
(Figure 10.11), there are two indentations:
the posterior median sulcus and the
anterior median fissure. Although there
might be slight variations, the cross
section of spinal cord is generally the same
throughout its length. In contrast to the
brain, the grey matter in the spinal cord
forms an inner butterfly shaped region
surrounded by the outer white matter.
The grey matter consists of neuronal cell
bodies and their dendrites, interneurons
and glial cells. White matter consists of
bundles of nerve fibres. In the center of
the grey matter there is a central canal
which is filled with CSF. Each half of the
grey matter is divided into **a dorsal horn**,
**a ventral horn and a lateral horn**.


The dorsal horn contains cell bodies of
interneurons on which afferent neurons
terminate. The ventral horn contains cell
bodies of the efferent motor neurons supplying
the skeletal muscle. Autonomic nerve fibres,
supplying cardiac and smooth muscles and
exocrine glands, originate from the cell bodies
found in the lateral horn. In the white matter,
the bundles of nerve fibres form two types of
tracts namely **ascending tracts** which carry
sensory impulses to the brain and **descending**
**tracts** which carry motor impulses from the
brain to the spinal nerves at various levels of
the spinal cord. The spinal cord shows two
enlargements, one in the cervical region and
another one in the lumbosacral region. The
**cervical enlargement** serves the upper limb
and lumbar enlargement serves the
lower limbs.
