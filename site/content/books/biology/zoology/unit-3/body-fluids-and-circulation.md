Animals particularly larger animals like
mammals, are more active. They depend on
locomotion to find food which is an energy
consuming process. Nervous system is
required to coordinate activities by sending
nerve impulses that involves energy.
All living cells have to be supplied with
nutrients, oxygen and other substances and
have to remove CO 2 and waste products
from them. It is therefore essential to have
efficient mechanisms for transport of these
substances to and from the cells. Different
groups of animals have evolved different
methods of transport. Very small organisms
like the sponges and coelenterates lack
a circulatory system. Water from their
surroundings enters their body cavity to
facilitate the cells to exchange substances
by diffusion. More complex organisms use
special fluids and well organized transport
systems within their body to transport
such materials by **bulk flow** or connective
transport with pumps. The phenomenon
of bulk flow is fundamental to many
physiological processes like respiration,
digestion and excretion. The bulk flow of
fluids can transport substances to long
distances faster than by diffusion. The
human circulatory system can circulate
a millilitre of blood from the heart to feet
and back again within 60 sec, rather than
60 years which may be needed if it were by
diffusion.

Within our body the oxygen and
carbon dioxide are exchanged in the lungs
and tissues whereas nutrients from the
digestive system are carried to the liver
and the wastes from the tissues are carried
by the blood and finally removed by the
kidneys. The hormones are transported
to their target organs. Circulatory system
helps to maintain the homeostasis of the
body fluids and body temperature (heat
exchange).

The homeostatic regulation of the
cardio vascular system maintains blood
flow, or perfusion, to the heart and brain.
In vasovagal syncope (fainting), signals
from the nervous system cause a sudden
decrease in blood pressure, and the
individual faints from lack of oxygen to
the brain.

In this chapter you will learn how the
heart and blood vessels work together
most of the time to prevent such problems.

## 7.1 Body fluids

The body fluid consists of water and
substances dissolved in them. There are two
types of body fluids, the intracellular fluid
present inside the cells and the extracellular
fluid present outside the cells. The three types
of extracellular fluids are the **interstitial**
**fluid** or tissue fluid (surrounds the cell), the
**plasma** (fluid component of the blood) and
lymph. The blood flowing into the capillary
from an arteriole has a high hydrostatic
pressure. This pressure is brought about
by the pumping action of the blood and it
tends to force water and small molecules out
through the permeable walls of the capillary
into the tissue fluid.


The volume of fluid which leaves the
capillary to form tissue fluid is the result
of two pressure (hydrostatic pressure and
Oncotic pressure). At the anterior end of the
capillary bed, the water potential is lesser
than hydrostatic pressure inside the capilary
bed which is enough to push fluid into the
tissues. The tissue fluid has low concentration
of protien than that of plasma. At the venous
end of the capillary bed, the water potential is
greater than the hydrostatic pressure and the
fluid from the tissues flows into the capillary
and water is drawn back into the blood, taking
with it waste products produced by the cells.

##### Composition of Blood


Blood is the most common body fluid that
transports substances from one part of the
body to the other. Blood is a connective
tissue consisting of plasma (fluid matrix) and
formed elements. The plasma constitutes 55%
of the total blood volume. The remaining 45%
is the formed elements that consist of blood
cells. The average blood volume is about
5000ml (5L) in an adult weighing 70 Kg.

##### 7.1.1 Plasma

Plasma mainly consists of water (80-92%)
in which the plasma proteins, inorganic
constituents (0.9%), organic constituents
(0.1%) and respiratory gases are ­dissolved.
The four main types of plasma proteins
synthesized in the liver are albumin,
globulin, prothrombin and ­
­
fibrinogen.
**Albumin** maintains the osmotic pressure of
the blood. **Globulin** ­facilitates the transport
of ions, hormones, lipids and assists in
immune function. Both ­ **Prothrombin** and
**Fibrinogen are** involved in blood ­clotting.
**Organic ­constituents** include urea, amino
acids, glucose, fats and ­vitamins and the
**inorganic ­constituents** include chlorides,
carbonates and ­
phosphates of potassium,
sodium, c ­ alcium and magnesium. The
composition of plasma is not always
constant. Immediately after a meal, the blood
in the hepatic portal vein has a very high
concentration of glucose as it is transporting
glucose from the intestine to the liver where
it is stored. The concentration of the glucose
in the blood gradually falls after sometime
as most of the glucose is absorbed. If too
much of protein is consumed, the body
cannot store the excess amino acids formed
from the digestion of proteins. The liver
breaks down the excess amino acids and
produces urea. Blood in the hepatic vein has
a high concentration of urea than the blood
in other vessels namely, hepatic portal vein
and hepatic artery.

{{< box title="Liver receives its blood supply from two sources:" type="" >}}

The hepatic artery brings
oxygenated blood from the heart,
while the hepatic portal vein brings
blood from the intestine and other
abdominal organs. The blood is re-
turned from the liver to the heart by
the hepatic veins.

{{< /box >}}



##### 7.1.2 Formed elements

Red blood cells/corpuscles (erythrocytes),
white blood cells/corpuscles (Leucocytes)
and platelets are collectively called formed
elements.

![body fluids](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig7.1.eng.png )



##### Red blood cells


Red blood cells are abundant than the
other blood cells. There are about 5 million
to 5.5 millions of RBC mm23 of blood
in a healthy man and 4.5-5.0 millions
of RBC mm23

in healthy women. The
RBCs are very small with the diameter of
about 7μm (micrometer). The structure
of RBC is shown in Figure 7.1. The red
colour of the RBC is due to the presence
of a respiratory pigment, haemoglobin
dissolved in the cytoplasm. Haemoglobin
plays an important role in the transport of
respiratory gases and facilitates the exchange
of gases with the fluid outside the cell
(tissue fluid). The biconcave shaped RBCs
increases the surface area to volume ratio,
hence oxygen diffuses quickly in and out of
the cell. The RBCs are devoid of nucleus,
mitochondria, ribosomes and endoplasmic
reticulum. The absence of these organelles
accommodates more haemoglobin thereby
maximising the oxygen carrying capacity
of the cell. The average life span of RBCs
in a healthy individual is about 120 days
after which they are destroyed in the spleen
(graveyard / cemetery of RBCs) and the iron
component returns to the bone marrow
for reuse. **Erythropoietin** is a hormone
secreted by the kidneys in response to low
oxygen and helps in differentiation of stem
cells of the bone marrow to erythrocytes
(erythropoiesis) in adults. The ratio of red
blood cells to blood plasma is expressed as
**Haematocrit** (packed cell volume).

**White blood cells** (leucocytes) are
colourless, amoeboid, nucleated cells
devoid of haemoglobin and other pigments.
Approximately 6000 to 8000 per cubic
mm of WBCs are seen in the blood of an
average healthy individual. The different
types of WBCs are shown in Figure 7.2.
Depending on the presence or absence
of granules, WBCs are divided into two
types, **granulocytes** and **agranulocytes**.
Granulocytes are characterised by the
presence of granules in the cytoplasm and
are differentiated in the bone marrow.
The granulocytes include **neutrophils**,
**eosinophils and basophils**.

**Neutrophils** are also called heterophils
or polymorphonuclear (cells with 3-4
lobes of nucleus connected with delicate
threads) cells which constitute about 60%-
65% of the total WBCs. They are phagocytic
in nature and appear in large numbers in
and around the infected tissues.


**Eosinophils** have distinctly bilobed
nucleus and the lobes are joined by thin
strands. They are non-phagocytic and
constitute about 2-3% of the total WBCs.
Eosinophils increase during certain
types of parasitic infections and allergic
reactions.


**Basophils** are less numerous than any
other type of WBCs constituting 0.5%-
1.0% of the total number of leucocytes.
The cytoplasmic granules are large sized,
but fewer than eosinophils. Nucleus is
large sized and constricted into several
lobes but not joined by delicate threads.
Basophils secrete substances such as
heparin, serotonin and histamines.
They are also involved in inflammatory
reactions.

**Agranulocytes** are characterised by the
absence of granules in the cytoplasm and
are differentiated in the lymph glands and
spleen. These are of two types, **lymphocytes**
and **monocytes**. Lymphocytes constitute
28% of WBCs. These have large round
nucleus and small amount of cytoplasm.
The two types of lymphocytes are B and
T cells. Both B and T cells are responsible
for the immune responses of the body. B
cells produce antibodies to neutralize the
harmful effects of foreign substances and T
cells are involved in cell mediated immunity.


**Monocytes** (Macrophages) are
phagocytic cells that are similar to mast


![body fluids](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig7.2.eng.png )

cells and have kidney shaped nucleus.
They constitute 1-3% of the total WBCs.
The macrophages of the central nervous
system are the ‘microglia’, in the sinusoids
of the liver they are called ‘**Kupffer cells**’
and in the pulmonary region they are the
‘**alveolar macrophages**’.


**Platelets** are also called **thrombocytes**
that are produced from megakaryocytes
(special cells in bone marrow) and lack
nuclei. Blood normally contains 1, 50,000
-3, 50,000 platelets mm23

of blood. They
secrete substances involved in coagulation
or clotting of blood. The reduction in
platelet number can lead to clotting
disorders that result in excessive loss of
blood from the body.

##### 7.1.3 Blood groups

Commonly two types of blood groupings
are done. They are ABO and Rh which are
widely used all over the world.

##### ABO blood grouping


Depending on the presence or absence
of surface antigens on the RBCs, blood
group in individual belongs to four
different types namely, A, B, AB and O.
The plasma of A, B and O individuals have
natural antibodies (agglutinins) in them.
Surface antigens are called **agglutinogens**.
The antibodies (**agglutinin**) acting on
agglutinogen A is called anti A and the
agglutinin acting on agglutinogen B is
called anti B. Agglutinogens are absent
in O blood group. Agglutinogens A
and B are present in AB blood group
and do not contain anti A and anti B
in them. Distribution of antigens and
antibodies in blood groups are shown in
Table 7.1. A, B and O are major allelic
genes in ABO systems. All agglutinogens
contain sucrose, D-galactose, N-acetyl
glucosamine and 11 terminal amino acids.
The attachments of the terminal amino
acids are dependent on the gene products
of A and B. The reaction is catalysed by
glycosyl transferase.


Table 7.1 Distribution of antigens and
antibodies in different blood groups

| **Blood<br>group** 	| **Agglutinogens<br>(antigens) on<br>the RBC** 	| **Agglutinin<br>(antibodies)<br>in the plasma** 	|
|:---:	|:---:	|:---:	|
| A 	| A 	| Anti B 	|
| B 	| B 	| Anti A 	|
| AB 	| AB 	| No antibodies 	|
| O 	| No antigens 	| Anti A and Anti B 	|


**Rh factor** is a protein (**D antigen**)
present on the surface of the red blood cells
in majority (80%) of humans. This protein
is similar to the protein present in Rhesus
monkey, hence the term Rh. Individuals
who carry the antigen D on the surface of
the red blood cells are Rh1 (Rh positive)
and the individuals who do not carry
antigen D, are Rh2 (Rh negative). Rh factor
compatibility is also checked before blood
transfusion. When a pregnant women is
Rh2 and the foetus is Rh1 incompatibility
(mismatch) is observed. During the first
pregnancy, the Rh2 antigens of the foetus
does not get exposed to the mother’s
blood as both their blood are separated
by placenta. However, small amount of
the foetal antigen becomes exposed to
the mother’s blood during the birth of
the first child. The mother’s blood starts
to synthesize D antibodies. But during
subsequent pregnancies the Rh antibodies
from the mother (Rh2) enters the foetal
circulation and destroys the foetal
RBCs. This becomes fatal to the foetus
because the child suffers from anaemia
and jaundice. This condition is called
**erythroblastosis foetalis**. This condition
can be avoided by administration of
anti D antibodies (**Rhocum**) to the mother
immediately after the first child birth.

##### 7.1.4 Coagulation of blood

If you cut your finger or when you
get yourself hurt, your wound bleeds
for some time after which it stops to
bleed. This is because the blood clots or
coagulates in response to trauma. The
mechanism by which excessive blood
loss is prevented by the formation of clot
is called **blood coagulation** or **clotting**
**of blood**. Schematic representation of
blood coagulation is shown Figure 7.3.
The clotting process begins when the
endothelium of the blood vessel is damaged
and the connective tissue in its wall is
exposed to the blood. Platelets adhere to
collagen fibres in the connective tissue
and release substances that form the
platelet plug which provides emergency
protection against blood loss. Clotting
factors released from the clumped platelets
or damaged cells mix with clotting
factors in the plasma. The protein called
**prothrombin** is converted to its active
form called **thrombin** in the presence of
calcium and vitamin K. Thrombin helps
in the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin
threads. The threads of fibrins become
interlinked into a patch that traps blood
cell and seals the injured vessel until the
wound is healed. After sometime fibrin
fibrils contract, squeezing out a straw-
coloured fluid through a meshwork called
**serum** (Plasma without fibrinogen is called
serum). **Heparin** is an **anticoagulant**
produced in small quantities by mast
cells of connective tissue which prevents
coagulation in small blood vessels.

![body fluids](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig7.3.eng.png )


##### 7.1.5 Composition of lymph and its functions

About 90% of fluid that leaks from
capillaries eventually seeps back into
the capillaries and the remaining 10% is
collected and returned to blood system
by means of a series of tubules known as
**lymph vessels or lymphatics**. The fluid
inside the lymphatics is called lymph. The
lymphatic system consists of a complex
network of thin walled ducts (lymphatic
vessels), filtering bodies (lymph nodes)
and a large number of lymphocytic cell
concentrations in various lymphoid
organs. The lymphatic vessels have
smooth walls that run parallel to the blood
vessels, in the skin, along the respiratory
and digestive tracts. These vessels serve
as return ducts for the fluids that are
continually diffusing out of the blood
capillaries into the body tissues. The end
of a vessel is shown in Figure 7.4.

![body fluids](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig7.4.eng.png )

Lymph fluid must pass through the
lymph nodes before it is returned to the
blood. The lymph nodes that filter the fluid
from the lymphatic vessels of the skin are
highly concentrated in the neck, inguinal,
axillaries, respiratory and digestive tracts.
The lymph fluid flowing out of the lymph
nodes flow into large collecting duct
which finally drains into larger veins
that runs beneath the collar bone, the
subclavian vein and is emptied into the
blood stream. The narrow passages in
the lymph nodes are the sinusoids that
are lined with macrophages. The lymph
nodes successfully prevent the invading
microorganisms from reaching the blood
stream. Cells found in the lymphatics are
the **lymphocytes**. Lymphocytes collected
in the lymphatic fluid are carried via the
arterial blood and are recycled back to the
lymph. Fats are absorbed through lymph
in the lacteals present in the villi of the
intestinal wall.

{{< box title="" type="" >}}

1. Why protein molecules of larger size
can pass through the lymph vessel?

2. We have seen that capillary walls are
not permeable to plasma proteins.
Suggest where the protein comes
from.

3. The disease kwashiorkor is caused
by a diet which is very low in pro-
tein. The concentration of proteins
in blood becomes much lower than
usual. One of the symptoms of
kwashiorkor is edema. Give reasons.

### 7.2 Blood vessels – Arteries,Veins and capillaries

The vessels carrying the blood are of three
types; they are the arteries, veins and
capillaries. These vessels are hollow
structures and have complex walls
surrounding the lumen. The blood vessels
in humans are composed of three layers,
**tunica intima**, **tunica media** and **tunica**
**externa**. The inner layer, tunica intima
or tunica interna supports the vascular
endothelium, the middle layer, tunica
media is composed of smooth muscles and
an extra cellular matrix which contains
a protein, elastin. The contraction and
relaxation of the smooth muscles results
in vasoconstriction and vasodilation.
The outer layer, tunica externa or tunica
adventitia is composed of collagen fibres.
The structure of blood vessels is illustrated
in Figure 7.5.

##### Arteries

The blood vessels that carry blood away
from the heart are called **arteries**. The
arteries usually lie deep inside the body.
The walls of the arteries are thick, non-
collapsible to withstand high pressure.
Valves are absent and have a narrow lumen.
All arteries carry oxygenated blood, except
the pulmonary artery. The largest artery,
the **aorta** (2.5 cm in diameter and 2 mm
thick) branch into smaller arteries and
culminates into the tissues as feed arteries.
In the tissues the arteries branches into
arterioles.


As blood enters an arteriole it may have
a pressure of 85 mm Hg (11.3 KPa) but as
it leaves and flows into the capillary, the
pressure drops to 35 mm Hg (4.7 KPa).

![body fluids](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig7.5.eng.png )

(Note 1 mm Hg =0.13 KPa. SI unit of
mm Hg is KiloPascal (KPa)). Arterioles
are small, narrow, and thin walled which
are connected to the capillaries. A small
sphincter lies at the junction between
the arterioles and capillaries to regulate
the blood supply. Arteries do not always
branch into arterioles, they can also form
anastomoses.

{{< box title="" type="" >}}

**What** are anastomoses? These are
connections of one blood vessel (ar-
teries) with another blood vessel. They
provide alternate route of blood flow if
the original blood vessel is blocked. For
e.g., Arteries in the joints contain nu-
merous anastomoses. This allows blood
to flow freely even if one of the arteries
closes during bending of the joints.
{{< /box >}}



##### Capillaries

Capillary beds are made up of fine
networks of capillaries. The capillaries
are thin walled and
consist of single
layer of squamous
epithelium. Tunica
media and elastin
fibres are absent. The
capillary beds are the
site for exchange of
materials between
blood and tissues. The
walls of the capillaries
are guarded by
semilunar valves.
The blood volume in
the capillaries is high
but the flow of blood
is slow. Mixed blood (oxygenated and
deoxygenated) is present in the capillaries.

The capillary bed may be flooded with
blood or may be completely bypassed
depending on the body conditions in a
particular organ.

{{< box title="" type="" >}}

Why there are no blood capillaries in
the cornea of the eye and cartilage?
How are these regions supplied with
the required nutrients?

Suggest why arteries close to the heart
have more elastic fibers in their walls than
arteries further away from the heart?

{{< /box >}}

##### Veins

Veins have thinner walls and a larger
lumen and hence can be easily stretched.
They carry deoxygenated blood except,
the pulmonary vein. The blood pressure is
low and the lumen has a wide wall which
is collapsible. Tunica media is thinner in
veins than in arteries. Unidirectional flow
of blood in veins is due to the presence of
semilunar valves that prevents backflow
of blood. Blood samples are usually taken
from the veins rather than artery because
of low pressure in the veins.


###### 7.2.1 Coronary blood vessels

Blood vessels that supply blood to the
cardiac muscles with all nutrients and
removes wastes are the coronary arteries
and veins. Heart muscle is supplied by two
arteries namely right and left coronary
arteries. These arteries are the first branch
of the aorta. Arteries usually surround the
heart in the manner of a crown, hence called
coronary artery (*L. Corona - crown*).


Right ventricle and posterior portion
of left ventricle are supplied by the right
coronary artery. Anterior and lateral part
of the left ventricle is supplied by the left
coronary arteries.

{{< box title="" type="" >}}

**The Law of Laplace is used to understand the structure and function of blood vessels and the heart**. Laplace law states that the
tension in the walls of the blood vessel
is proportional to the blood pressure
and vessel radius. Blood vessels such as
aorta that is subjected to high pressures
have thicker walls than the arterioles
that are subjected to low pressures.

{{< /box >}}

### 7.3 Circulatory pathways

There are two types of
circulatory systems,
open and closed
circulatory systems.
**Open circulatory system**
has haemolymph as the
circulating fluid and is
pumped by the heart, which flows through
blood vessels into the sinuses. Sinuses are
referred as **haemocoel**. Open circulatory
system is seen in Arthropods and most
Molluscs. In **closed circulatory system**
blood is pumped by the heart and flows
through blood vessels. Closed circulating
system is seen in Annelids, Cephalopods
and Vertebrates.


All vertebrates have muscular chambered
heart. Fishes have two chambered heart.
The heart in fishes consists of sinus
venosus, an **atrium**, one **ventricle** and
**bulbus arteriosus** or **conus arteriosus**.
Single circulation is seen in fishes.
Amphibians have two auricles and one
ventricle and no inter ventricular septum
whereas reptiles except crocodiles have
two auricles and one ventricle and an
incomplete inter ventricular septum. Thus
mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated
blood takes place in the ventricles. This
type of circulation is called **incomplete**
**double circulation**. The left atrium
receives oxygenated blood and the right
atrium receives deoxygenated blood.
Pulmonary and systemic circuits are
seen in Amphibians and Reptiles. The
Crocodiles, Birds and Mammals have
two auricles or atrial chambers and two
ventricles, the auricles and ventricles are
separated by inter auricular septum and
inter ventricular septum. Hence there is
complete separation of oxygenated blood
from the deoxygenated blood. Pulmonary
and systemic circuits are evident. This
type of circulation is called **complete**
**double circulation**.

### 7.4 Human circulatory system

The structure of the heart was described
by **Raymond de viessens**, in 1706. Human
heart is made of special type of muscle
called the **cardiac muscle**.
It is situated in the thoracic
cavity and its apex
portion is slightly tilted
towards left. It weighs
about 300g in an adult.
The size of our heart is
roughly equal to a closed
fist. Heart is divided into
four chambers, upper two
small auricles or atrium
and lower two large
ventricles. The walls of
the ventricles are thicker
than the auricles due to
the presence of papillary
muscles. The heart wall is made up of
three layers, the outer **epicardium**, middle
**myocardium** and inner **endocardium**.
The space present between the membranes
is called pericardial space and is filled
with pericardial fluid.

The two auricles are separated by **inter**
**auricular septum** and the two ventricles
are separated by **inter ventricular septum**
The separation of chambers avoids mixing
of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. The
auricle communicates with the ventricle
through an opening called **auriculo**
**ventricular aperture** which is guarded
by the **auriculo ventricular valves**. The
opening between the right atrium and the
right ventricle is guarded by the **tricuspid**
**valve** (three flaps or cusps), whereas a
**bicuspid** (two flaps or cusps) or **mitral**
**valve** guards the opening between the left
atrium and left ventricle (Figure 7.6). The
valves of the heart allows the blood to flow
only in one direction, i.e., from the atria to
the ventricles and from the ventricles to the
pulmonary artery or the aorta. These valves
prevent backward flow of blood.


![body fluids](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig7.6.eng.png )

The opening of right and left ventricles
into the pulmonary artery and aorta
are guarded by aortic and pulmonary
valves and are called **semilunar valves**.

Each semilunar valve is made of
three half- moon shaped cusps. The
myocardium of the ventricle is thrown
into irregular muscular ridges called
**trabeculae corneae**. The trabeculae
corneae are modified into **chordae**
**tendinae**. The opening and closing of
the semilunar valves are achieved by the
chordae tendinae. The chordae tendinae
are attached to the lower end of the heart
by papillary muscles. Heart receives
deoxygenated blood from various parts
of the body through the inferior venacava
and superior venacava which open into
the right auricle. Oxygenated blood
from lungs is drained into the left auricle
through four pulmonary veins.

##### 7.4.1 Origin and conduction of heartbeat

The heart in human is myogenic
(cardiomyocytes can produce
spontaneous rhythmic depolarisation
that initiates contractions). The sequence
of electrical conduction
of heart is shown in
Figure 7.7. The cardiac
cells with fastest rhythm
are called the **Pacemaker**
**cells**, since they determine
the contraction rate of
the entire heart. These
cells are located in the
right **sinuatrial (SA)**
**node/ Pacemaker**. On
the left side of the right
atrium is a node called
**auriculo ventricular**
**node** (AV node). Two
special cardiac muscle
fibres originate from the
auriculo ventricular node and are called
the **bundle of His** which runs down into
the interventricular septum and the fibres
spread into the ventricles. These fibres are
called the **Purkinje fibres**.


Pacemaker cells produce excitation
through depolarisation of their cell
membrane. Early depolarisation is slow
and takes place by sodium influx and
reduction in potassium efflux. Minimum
potential is required to activate voltage
gated calcium (Ca+) channels that causes
rapid depolarisation which results in
action potential. The pace maker cells
repolarise slowly via \\(K^1\\) efflux.


HEART BEAT- Rhythmic contraction
and expansion of heart is called **heart**
**beat**. The contraction of the heart is called
**systole** and the relaxation of the heart is
called **diastole**. The heart normally beats
70-72 times per min in a human adult.
During each cardiac cycle two sounds
are produced that can be heard through
a **stethoscope**. The first heart sound

![body fluids](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig7.7.eng.png )

(lub) is associated with the closure of the
tricuspid and bicuspid valves whereas
second heart sound (dub) is associated
with the closure of the semilunar valves.
These sounds are of clinical diagnostic
significance. An increased heart rate is
called **tachycardia** and decreased heart
rate is called **bradycardia**.

##### 7.4.2 Cardiac Cycle

The events that occur at the beginning of
heart beat and lasts until the beginning of
next beat is called cardiac cycle. It lasts for
0.8 seconds. The series of events that takes
place in a **cardiac cycle**.


PHASE 1: **Ventricular diastole**- The
pressure in the auricles increases than
that of the ventricular pressure. AV valves
are open while the semi lunar valves are
closed. Blood flows from the auricles into
the ventricles passively.


PHASE 2: **Atrial systole** - The atria
contracts while the ventricles are still
relaxed. The contraction of the auricles
pushes maximum volume of blood to
the ventricles until they reach the end
diastolic volume (EDV). EDV is related
to the length of the cardiac muscle fibre.
More the muscle is stretched, greater the
EDV and the stroke volume.


PHASE 3: **Ventricular systole**
(isovolumetric contraction) - The
ventricular contraction forces the AV
valves to close and increases the pressure
inside the ventricles. The blood is then
pumped from the ventricles into the aorta
without change in the size of the muscle
fibre length and ventricular chamber
volume (isovolumetric contraction).


PHASE 4: **Ventricular systole**
(ventricular ejection) - Increased
ventricular pressure forces the semilunar
valves to open and blood is ejected out of
the ventricles without backflow of blood.
This point is the end of systolic volume
(ESV).

PHASE 5: (**Ventricular diastole**) -The
ventricles begins to relax, pressure in
the arteries exceeds ventricular pressure,
resulting in the closure of the semilunar
valves. The heart returns to phase 1 of the
cardiac cycle.

##### 7.4.3 Cardiac output

The amount of blood pumped out by each
ventricle per minute is called **cardiac**
**output(CO)**. It is a product of **heart rate**
(HR) and **stroke volume** (SV). Heart
rate or pulse is the number of beats per
minute. Pulse pressure = systolic pressure
– diastolic pressure. Stroke volume (SV)
is the volume of blood pumped out by
one ventricle with each beat. SV depends
on ventricular contraction. CO = HR X
SV. SV represents the difference between
EDV (amount of blood that collects in a
ventricle during diastole) and ESV (volume
of blood remaining in the ventricle after
contraction). SV = EDV - ESV. According
to Frank – Starling law of the heart, the
critical factor controlling SV is the degree
to which the cardiac muscle cells are
stretched just before they contract. The
most important factor stretching cardiac
muscle is the amount of blood returning
to the heart and distending its ventricles,
venous return. During vigorous exercise,
SV may double as a result of venous
return. Heart’s pumping action normally
maintains a balance between cardiac
output and venous return. Because the
heart is a double pump, each side can fail
independently of the other. If the left side
of the heart fails, it results in **pulmonary**
**congestion** and if the right side fails, it
results in peripheral congestion. Frank
– Starling effect protects the heart from
abnormal increase in blood volume.

When blood volume drops down
abruptly, what happens to the stroke
volume? State whether it increases or
decreases?

##### Blood Pressure

Blood pressure is the pressure exerted on
the surface of blood vessels by the blood.
This pressure circulates the blood through
arteries, veins and capillaries. There are two
types of pressure, the systolic pressure and
the diastolic pressure. Systolic pressure is
the pressure in the arteries as the chambers
of the heart contracts. Diastolic pressure
is the pressure in the arteries when the
heart chambers relax. Blood pressure is
measured using a **sphygmomanometer** (BP
apparatus). It is expressed as systolic pressure
/ diastolic pressure. Normal blood pressure
in man is about **120/80mm Hg**. Mean
arterial pressure is a function of cardiac
output and resistance in the arterioles. The
primary reflex pathway for homeostatic
control of mean arterial pressure is the
**baroreceptor reflex**. The baroreceptor
reflex functions every morning when you
get out of bed. When you are lying flat the
gravitational force is evenly distributed.
When you stand up, gravity causes blood to
pool in the lower extremities. The decrease
in blood pressure upon standing is known
as **orthostatic hypotension**. Orthostatic
reflex normally triggers baroreceptor reflex.
This results in increased cardiac output
and increased peripheral resistance which
together increase the mean arterial pressure.

##### 7. 4. 4 Electrocardiogram (ECG)


An electrocardiogram (ECG) records the
electrical activity of the heart over a period
of time using electrodes placed on the skin,
arms, legs and chest. It records the changes
in electrical potential across the heart during
one cardiac cycle. The special flap of muscle
which initiates the heart beat is called as
**sinu-auricular node** or **SA node** in the right
atrium. It spreads as a wave of contraction in
the heart. The waves of the ECG are due to
depolarization and not due to contraction of
the heart. This wave of depolarisation occurs
before the beginning of contraction of the
cardiac muscle. A normal ECG shows 3 waves
designated as P wave, QRS complex and T
wave as shown in Figure 7.8 and the stages of
the ECG graph are shown in Figure 7.9.
