Earliest animal life forms arose around
700 million years ago. They were marine
organisms like the modern sponges. Each
cell of a modern sponge is surrounded
by sea water, but it maintains an
intracellular ionic composition different
from that of the sea water. Evolution
led to changes in the organisation of the
tissue layers followed by formation of
specialized external tissue layers. This
provided a barrier between the external
environment and internal fluid resulting
in the formation of extracellular fluid.
Major changes in osmoregulation and
ionic regulation occurred during the
evolution of chordates. The ability to
control extracellular fluid composition
was essential for the diversification of
animals to inhabit brackish water, fresh
water and land. Animals that invaded
land had the risk of desiccation and
were unable to excrete metabolic waste
directly into the water; hence there was a
need for an alternate pathway to dispose
the nitrogenous wastes.

 Most animals rely on kidneys to
control ionic and water balance. Some
animals depend on external tissues such
as the gills, skin and digestive mucosa to
collectively regulate three homeostatic
processes namely, osmotic regulation,
ionic regulation and nitrogen excretion.
Osmotic regulation is the control of tissue
osmotic pressure which acts as a driving
force for movement of water across
biological membranes. Ionic regulation
is the control of the ionic composition
of body fluids. The process by which
the body gets rid of the nitrogenous
waste products of protein metabolism
is called excretion. Nitrogen excretion
is the pathway by which animals excrete
ammonia, the toxic nitrogenous end
product of protein catabolism. The
removal of ammonia or other metabolic
alternatives such as urea and uric acid is
linked to ionic and osmotic homeostasis.
Fresh water vertebrates maintain
higher salt concentrations in their body
fluids; marine vertebrates maintain
lower salt concentrations in their body
fluids and terrestrial animals have
more water in their body than the
surrounding hence tend to lose water
by evaporation. Osmoconformers are
able to change their internal osmotic
concentration with change in external
environment as in marine molluscs
and sharks. Osmoregulators maintain
their internal osmotic concentration
irrespective of their external osmotic
environment (example: Otters).
Depending on the ability to tolerate
changes in the external environment,
animals are classified as stenohaline and
euryhaline. The stenohaline animals can
tolerate only narrow fluctuations in the
salt concentration (example: Gold fish),
whereas the euryhaline animals are ableto 
tolerate wide fluctuations in the salt
concentrations eg., Artemia, Tilapia and
Salmons.

The major nitrogenous waste products
are ammonia, urea and uric acid. Other
waste products of protein metabolism
are trimethyl amine oxide (TMO) in
marine teleosts, guanine in spiders,
hippuric acid, allantonin, allantoic acid,
ornithuric acid, creatinine, creatine,
purines, pyramidines and pterines.

#### **8.1 Modes of Excretion**

Excretory system helps in collecting
nitrogenous waste and expelling it into
the external environment. Animals have
evolved different strategies to get rid
of these nitrogenous wastes. Ammonia
produced during amino acid breakdown
is toxic hence must be excreted either
as ammonia, urea or uric acid. The type
of nitrogenous end product an animal
excretes depends upon the habitat of the
animal. Ammonia requires large amount
of water for its elimination, whereas uric
acid, being the least toxic can be removed
with the minimum loss of water, and urea
can be stored in the body for considerable
periods of time, as it is less toxic and less
soluble in water than ammonia.

Animals that excrete most of its
nitrogen in the form of ammonia are
called **ammonoteles**. Many fishes, aquatic
amphibians and aquatic insects are
ammonotelic. In bony fishes, ammonia
diffuses out across the body surface or
through gill surface as ammonium ions.
Reptiles, birds, land snails and insects
excrete uric acid crystals, with a minimum
loss of water and are called **uricoteles**.
In terrestrial animals, less toxic urea and


![Excreation](/books/biology/unit-3/excreation/ex2.png )

uric acid are produced to conserve water.
Mammals and terrestrial amphibians
mainly excrete urea and are called ureoteles.
Earthworms while in soil are **ureoteles** and
when in water are ammonoteles. Figure 8.1
shows the excretory products in different
groups of animals.

The animal kingdom presents a wide
variety of excretory structures. Most
invertebrates have a simple tubular
structure in the form of primitive kidneys
called protonephridia and **metanephridia**.
Vertebrates have complex tubular organs
called kidneys. **Protonephridia** are excretory
structures with specialized cells in the form
of **flame cells** (cilia) in Platyhelminthes
(example tapeworm) and **Solenocytes**
(flagella) in Amphioxus. Nematodes have
**rennette cells, Metanephridia** are the
tubular excretory structures in annelids
and molluscs. **Malpighian tubules** are
the excretory structures in most insects.
**Antennal glands or green glands** perform
excretory function in crustaceans like
prawns. Vertebrate kidney differs among taxa
in relation to the environmental conditions.
Nephron is the structural and functional
unit of kidneys. Reptiles have reduced
glomerulus or lack glomerulus and Henle’s
loop and hence produce very little hypotonic
urine, whereas mammalian kidneys produce
concentrated (hyperosmotic) urine due to
the presence of long Henle’s loop. The Loop
of Henle of the nephron has evolved to form
hypertonic urine. Aglomerular kidneys of
marine fishes produce little urine that is
isoosmotic to the body fluid. Amphibians
and fresh water fish lack Henle’s loop hence
produce dilute urine (hypoosmotic).

The average bladder holds between
300ml and 600ml of urine. If the urinary
system is healthy, urine may stay in the
bladder for up to about 5 hours before
excretion, depending on the amount of
liquid consumed. Nerves send signals to
the brain when the bladder needs to be
emptied, with this indication one will feel
the urge to empty the bladder. The muscle
in the bladder wall is called the ‘detrusor’
muscle. One may suffer from stress if
the muscles supporting the bladder are
weakened. Pelvic floor exercise helps to
strengthen these muscles.

#### **8.2 Human excretory system**


#####  **8.2.1 Structure of kidney**

Excretory system in human consists of a
pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters, urinary
bladder and urethra (Figure. 8.2). Kidneysare reddish brown, bean shaped structures
that lie in the superior lumbar region
between the levels of the last thoracic and
third lumber vertebra close to the dorsal
inner wall of the abdominal cavity. The
right kidney is placed slightly lower than
the left kidney. Each kidney weighs an
average of 120-170 grams. The outer layer
of the kidney is covered by three layers of
supportive tissues namely, renal fascia,
perirenal fat capsule and fibrous capsule.


![Excreation](/books/biology/unit-3/excreation/ex3.png )

The longitudinal section of kidney (Figure.
8.3) shows, an outer cortex, inner medulla
and pelvis. The medulla is divided into a
few conical tissue masses called medullary
pyramids or renal pyramids. The part of
cortex that extends in between the medullary
pyramids is the renal columns of **Bertini**.
The centre of the inner concave surface
of the kidney has a notch called the renal
**hilum**, through which ureter, blood vessels
and nerves innervate. Inner to the hilum is
a broad funnel shaped space called the renal
pelvis with projection called calyces. The
renal pelvis is continuous with the ureter once
it leaves the hilum. The walls of the calyces,
pelvis and ureter have smooth muscles which
contracts rhythmically. The calyces collect
the urine and empties into the ureter, which
is stored in the urinary bladder temporarily.
The urinary bladder opens into the urethra
through which urine is expelled out.


![Excreation](/books/biology/unit-3/excreation/ex4.png )


##### **8.2.2 Structure of a nephron**



Each kidney has nearly one million complex
tubular structures called nephron (Figure 8.4).
Each nephron consists of a filtering corpuscle
called renal corpuscle (malpighian body) and
a renal tubule. The renal tubule opens into a
longer tubule called the collecting duct. The
renal tubule begins with a double walled
cup shaped structure called the Bowman’s
capsule, which encloses a ball of capillaries
that delivers fluid to the tubules, called the
glomerulus. The Bowman’s capsule and the
glomerulus together constitute the renal
corpuscle. The endothelium of glomerulus
has many pores (fenestrae). The external
parietal layer of the Bowman's capsule is
made up of simple squamous epithelium
and the visceral layer is made of epithelial
cells called podocytes. The podocytes end in
foot processes which cling to the basement
membrane of the glomerulus. The openings
between the foot processes are called filtration
slits.


![Excreation](/books/biology/unit-3/excreation/ex5.png )



The renal tubule continues further
to form the proximal convoluted tubule
[PCT] followed by a U-shaped loop
of Henle (Henle’s loop) that has a thin
descending and a thick ascending limb.
The ascending limb continues as a highly
coiled tubular region called the distal
convoluted tubule [DCT]. The DCT of
many nephrons open into a straight tube
called collecting duct. The collecting duct
runs through the medullary pyramids in
the region of the pelvis. Several collecting
ducts fuse to form papillary duct that
delivers urine into the calyces, which
opens into the renal pelvis.

In the renal tubules, PCT and DCT of the
nephron are situated in the cortical region of
the kidney whereas the loop of Henle is in the
medullary region. In majority of nephrons,
the loop of Henle is too short and extends
only very little into the medulla and are called
**cortical nephrons**. Some nephrons have
very long loop of Henle that run deep into
the medulla and are called **juxta medullary**
**nephrons** (JMN) (Figure 8.5 a and b)



![Excreation](/books/biology/unit-3/excreation/ex6.png )



![Excreation](/books/biology/unit-3/excreation/ex7.png )



**The capillary bed of the nephrons-**
First capillary bed of the nephron is the
glomerulus and the other is the peritubular
capillaries. The glomerular capillary bed is
different from other capillary beds in that
it is supplied by the afferent and drained
by the efferent arteriole. The efferent
arteriole that comes out of the glomerulus
forms a fine capillary network around
the renal tubule called the peritubular
capillaries. The efferent arteriole serving
the juxta medullary nephron forms
bundles of long straight vessel called
vasa recta and runs parallel to the loop of
Henle. Vasa recta is absent or reduced in
cortical nephrons (Figure 8.6).

loop of Henle and short loop of Henle

##### **8.3 Mechanism of urine formation in human**


The nitrogenous waste
formed as a result of
breakdown of amino
acids is converted to
urea in the liver by the
Ornithine cycle or urea
cycle (Figure 8.7).

![Excreation](/books/biology/unit-3/excreation/ex7.png )


Urine formation involves three main
processes namely, glomerular filtration,
tubular reabsorption and tubular secretion.


**i) Glomerular Filtration:** 


Blood enters the kidney from the renal artery, into the
glomerulus. Blood is composed of large
quantities of water, colloidal proteins,
sugars, salts and nitrogenous end product.
The first step in urine formation is the
filtration of blood that takes place in the
glomerulus. This is called glomerular
filtration which is a passive process. The
fluid that leaves the glomerular capillaries
and enters the Bowman’s capsule is called
the glomerular filtrate. The glomerular
membrane has a large surface area and
is more permeable to water and small
molecules present in the blood plasma.
Blood enters the glomerulus faster with
greater force through the afferent arteriole
and leaves the glomerulus through the
efferent arterioles, much slower. This
force is because of the difference in sizes
between the afferent and efferent arteriole
(afferent arteriole is wider than efferent
arteriole) and glomerular hydrostatic
pressure which is around 55mm Hg.


  Kidneys produce about 180L of
glomerular filtrate in 24 hours. The
molecules such as water, glucose, amino
acids and nitrogenous substances pass
freely from the blood into the glomerulus.
Molecules larger than 5nm are barred from
entering the tubule. Glomerular pressure
is the chief force that pushes water and
solutes out of the blood and across the
filtration membrane. The glomerular
blood pressure (approximately 55 mmHg)
is much higher than in other capillary beds.
The two opposing forces are contributed
by the plasma proteins in the capillaries.
These includes, colloidal osmotic pressure
(30 mmHg) and the capsular hydrostatic
pressure (15 mmHg) due to the fluids in
the glomerular capsule. The net filtration
pressure of 10 mmHg is responsible for
the renal filtration.


Net filtration Pressure = Glomerular

hydrostatic pressure  -  (Colloidal osmotic pressure  + Capsular hydrostatic pressure).

Net filtration pressure =  55 mmHg - (30 mmHg + 15 mmHg) =  10mmHg


The effective glomerular pressure
of 10 mmHg results in **ultrafiltration**.
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the
volume of filtrate formed min21
in all nephrons (glomerulus) of both the kidneys.
In adults the GFR is approximately 120- 125mL/min. 
Blood from the glomerulus is
passed out through the efferent arteriole.
The smooth muscle of the efferent arteriole
contract resulting in vasoconstriction.
Table 8.1 shows the relative concentrations
of substances in the blood plasma and the
glomerular filtrate. The glomerular filtrate
is similar to blood plasma except that
there are no plasma proteins. In cortical
nephrons, blood from efferent arteriole
flows into peritubular capillary beds and
enters the venous system carrying with
it recovered solutes and water from the
interstitial fluid that surrounds the tubule.

proteins and higher than normal GFR.

{{< /box >}}



**ii) Tubular Reabsorption**

This involves movement of the filtrate back
into the circulation. The volume of filtrate
formed per day is around 170-180 L and the
urine released is around 1.5 L per day, i.e.,
nearly 99% of the glomerular filtrate that
has to be reabsorbed by the renal tubules
as it contains certain substances needed by
the body. This process is called selective
reabsorption. Reabsorption takes place
by the tubular epithelial cells in different
segments of the nephron either by active
transport or passive transport, diffusion and
osmosis.

**Proximal convoluted Tubule (PCT)-**
Glucose, lactate, amino acids, Na1 and
water in the filtrate is reabsorbed in the
PCT. Sodium is reabsorbed by active
transport through sodium- potassium
(Na1 K1) pump in the PCT. Small amounts
of urea and uric acid are also reabsorbed.


**Descending limb** of Henle’s loop is
permeable to water due the presence of
aquaporins, but not permeable to salts.
Water is lost in the descending limb,
hence Na1 and Cl2 gets concentrated in
the filtrate.


**Ascending limb** of Henle’s loop is
impermeable to water but permeable to
solutes such as Na1, Cl2 and K1.
The distal convoluted tubule recovers
water and secretes potassium into the
tubule. Na1, Cl2 and water remains
in the filtrate of the DCT. Most of the
reabsorption from this point is dependent
on the body’s need and is regulated by
hormones. Reabsorption of bicarbonate
(HCO32) takes place to regulate the blood
pH. Homeostasis of K1 and Na1 in the
blood is also regulated in this region.


{{< box title="" type="objective" >}}

*Aquaporins are water–permeable channels (membrane transport proteins) that allow water to move*
*across the epithelial cells in relation to the osmotic difference from the lumen to the* *interstitial fluid.*

{{< /box >}}



Collecting duct is permeable to water,
secretes K1 (potassium ions are actively
transported into the tubule) and reabsorbs
Na1 to produce concentrated urine. The
change in permeability to water is due
to the presence of number of water-
permeable channels called aquaporins.

**Tubular secretion-**  Substances such as
H1, K1, NH41, creatinine and organic acids
move into the filtrate from the peritubular
capillaries into the tubular fluid. Most
of the water is absorbed in the proximal
convoluted tubule and Na1 is exchanged
for water in the loop of Henle. Hypotonic
fluid enters the distal convoluted tubule
and substances such as urea and salts pass
from peritubular blood into the cells of
DCT. The urine excreted contains both
filtered and secreted substances. Once
it enters the collecting duct, water is
absorbed and concentrated hypertonic
urine is formed. For every H1 secreted
into the tubular filtrate, a Na1 is absorbed
by the tubular cell. The H1 secreted
combines with HCO32, HPO32 and NH32
and gets fixed as H2CO41, H2PO41 and NH4 1 respectively. Since H1 gets fixed in
the fluid, reabsorption of H1 is prevented.


{{< box title="" type="objective" >}}


*Osmolarity - The solute concentration*
*of a solution of water is known as the*
*solutions osmolarity, expressed as*
*milliosmoles /liter (mOsm/L)*


{{< /box >}}


**Formation of concentrated urine**


Formation of concentrated urine is
accomplished by kidneys using counter
current mechanisms. The major function
of Henle’s loop is to concentrate Na1 and
Cl2. There is low osmolarity near the cortex
and high osmolarity towards the medulla.
This osmolarity in the medulla is due to
the presence of the solute transporters
and is maintained by the arrangement of
the loop of Henle, collecting duct and vasa
recta. This arrangement allows movement
of solutes from the filtrate to the
interstitial fluid. At the transition between
the proximal convoluted tubule and the
descending loop of Henle the osmolarity
of the interstitial fluid is similar to that of
the blood – about 300mOsm.

**Ascending and descending limbs**
**of Henle, create a counter current**
**multiplier** (interaction between flow of
filtrate through the limbs of Henle’s and
JMN) by active transport. Figure 8.8 (a)
shows the counter current multiplier
created by the long loops of **Henle of the**
**JM nephrons which creates medullary**
**osmotic gradient.**

As the fluid enters the descending
limb, water moves from the lumen into
the interstitial fluid and the osmolarity of
interstitial fluid decreases. To counteract
this dilution the region of the ascending
limb actively pumps solutes from the
lumen into the interstitial fluid and the
osmolarity increases to about 1200mOsm
in medulla. This mismatch between water
and salts creates osmotic gradient in the
medulla. The osmotic gradient is also due
to the permeability of the collecting duct
to urea.

**The vasa recta, maintains the**
**medullary osmotic gradient via counter**
**current exchanger** (the flow of blood
through the ascending and descending vasa
recta blood vessels) by passive transport.
Figure 8.8 (b) shows counter current
exchanger where the vasa recta preserves
the medullary gradient while removing
reabsorbed water and solutes. **This system**
**does not produce an osmotic gradient,**
**but protects the medulla** by removal of
excess salts from the interstitial fluid and
removing reabsorbed water. The vasa recta
leave the kidney at the junction between the
cortex and medulla. The interstitial fluid at
this point is iso-osmotic to the blood.

When the blood leaves the efferent
arteriole and enters vasa recta the osmolarity
in the medulla increases (1200mOsm) and
results in passive uptake of solutes and loss
of water in descending vasa recta. As the
blood enters the cortex, the osmolarity in
the blood decreases (300mOsm) and the
blood loses solutes and gains water.

At the final stage in collecting duct to
form concentrated urine (hypertonic).
Human kidneys can produce urine nearly
four times concentrated than the initial
filtrate formed.

### **8.4 Regulation of kidney function**

**ADH and Diabetes insipidus**

The functioning of kidneys is efficiently
monitored and regulated by hormonal
feedback control mechanism involving
the hypothalamus, juxta glomerular
apparatus and to a certain extent the heart.
Osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus are
activated by changes in the blood volume,
body fluid volume and ionic concentration.


![Excreation](/books/biology/unit-3/excreation/ex9.png )

When there is excessive loss of fluid from
the body or when there is an increase in the
blood pressure, the osmoreceptors of the
hypothalamus respond by stimulating the
neurohypophysis to secrete the antidiuretic
hormone (ADH) or vasopressin (a positive
feedback). ADH facilitates reabsorption
of water by increasing the number of
aquaporins on the cell surface membrane of
the distal convoluted tubule and collecting
duct. This increase in aquaporins causes the
movement of water from the lumen into the
interstitial cells, thereby preventing excess
loss of water by diuresis. When you drink
excess amounts of your favourite juice,
osmoreceptors of the hypothalamus is no
longer stimulated and the release
of ADH is suppressed from
the neurohypophysis (negative
feedback) and the aquaporins of
the collecting ducts move into
the cytoplasm. This makes the
collecting ducts impermeable to
water and the excess fluid flows
down the collecting duct without
any water loss. Hence dilute urine
is produced to maintain the blood
volume. Vasopressin secretion
is controlled by positive and
negative feedback mechanism.
Defects in ADH receptors or
inability to secrete ADH leads
to a condition called diabetes
insipidus, characterized by
excessive thirst and excretion of
large quantities of dilute urine
resulting in dehydration and fall
in blood pressure.

**Renin angiotensin**

Juxta glomerular apparatus (JGA) is a
specialized tissue in the afferent arteriole of
the nephron that consists of macula densa
and granular cells. The macula densa cells
sense distal tubular flow and affect afferent
arteriole diameter, whereas the granular
cells secrete an enzyme called renin. A fall
in glomerular blood flow, glomerular blood
pressure and glomerular filtration rate, can
atctivate JG cells to release renin which
converts a plasma protein, angiotensinogen


{{< box title="" type="objective" >}}

Angiotensin Converting Enzyme
inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) are used
to treat high blood pressure. Using a
flow chart, explain why these drugs are
helpful in treating hypertension.

{{< /box >}}


(synthesized in the liver) to angiotensin
I. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II.
Angiotensin II stimulates Na1 reabsorption
in the proximal convoluted tubule by
vasoconstriction of the blood vessels and
increases the glomerular blood pressure.
Angiotensin II acts at different sites such
as heart, kidney, brain, adrenal cortex and
blood vessels. It stimulates adrenal cortex to
secrete aldosterone that causes reabsorption
of Na1, K1 excretion and absorption of
water from the distal convoluted tubule
and collecting duct. This increases the
glomerular blood pressure and glomerular
filtration rate. This complex mechanism is
generally known as Renin- Angiotensin-
Aldosterone System (RAAS). Figure 8.9
shows the schematic representation of the
various hormones in the regulation of body
fluid concentration.


**Atrial natriuretic factor**

Excessive stretch of cardiac atrial cells cause
an increase in blood flow to the atria of the
heart and release Atrial Natriuretic Peptide
or factor (ANF) travels to the kidney where
it increases Na1 excretion and increases
the blood flow to the glomerulus, acting
on the afferent glomerular arterioles as a
vasodilator or on efferent arterioles as a
vasoconstrictor. It decreases aldosterone
release from the adrenal cortex and
also decreases release of renin, thereby
decreasing angiotensin II. ANF acts
antagonistically to the renin- angiotensin
system, aldosterone and vasopressin.

### **8.5 Micturition**


The process of release of urine from
the bladder is called micturition orurination. Urine formed by the nephrons
is ultimately carried to the urinary
bladder where it is stored till it receives a
voluntary signal from the central nervous
system. The stretch receptors present
in the urinary bladder are stimulated
when it gets filled with urine. Stretching
of the urinary bladder stimulates the
CNS via the sensory neurons of the
parasympathetic nervous system and
brings about contraction of the bladder.
Simultaneously, somatic motor neurons
induce the sphincters to close. Smooth
muscles contracts resulting in the opening
of the internal sphincters passively and
relaxing the external sphincter. When
the stimulatory and inhibitory controls
exceed the threshold, the sphincter opens
and the urine is expelled out.


An adult human on an average excretes
1 to 1.5 L of urine per day. The urine
formed is a yellow coloured watery fluid
which is slightly acidic in nature (pH 6.0),
Changes in diet may cause pH to vary
between 4.5 to 8.0 and has a characteristic
odour. The yellow colour of the urine
is due to the presence of a pigment,
urochrome. On an average, 25-30 gms of


{{< box title="" type="objective" >}}

Hypotonic urine is formed when
osmotic pressure of the body fluid is
decreased due to water retention or
solute loss when ADH secretion is
lowered. If you drink large volume of
water without eating anything salty,
the total body fluid volume increases
quickly and the osmolarity decreases.
The kidneys increases the volume of
urine excreted. The reverse happens
when you eat salty food without
drinking water.

urea is excreted per day. Various metabolic
disorders can affect the composition
of urine. Analysis of urine helps in
clinical diagnosis of various metabolic
disorders and the malfunctioning of the
kidneys. For example the presence of
glucose (glucosuria) and ketone bodies
(ketonuria) in the urine are indications
of diabetes mellitus.


### **8.6 Role of other organs in excretion**

Apart from kidneys, organs such as lungs,
liver and skin help to remove wastes. Our
lungs remove large quantities of carbon
dioxide (18 L/day) and significant quantities
of water every day. Liver secretes bile
containing substances like, bilirubin and
biliverdin, cholesterol, steroid hormones,
vitamins and drugs which are excreted out
along with the digestive wastes.

Sweat and sebaceous glands in the skin
eliminate certain wastes through their
secretions. Sweat produced by the sweat
glands primarily helps to cool the body and
secondarily excretes Na1 and Cl2, small
quantities of urea and lactate. Sebaceous
glands eliminate certain substances like
sterols, hydrocarbons and waxes through
sebum that provides a protective oily covering
for the skin. Small quantities of nitrogenous
wastes are also excreted through saliva.

### **8.7 Disorders related to the Excretory System**

**Urinary tract infection**

Female’s urethra is very short and its
external opening is close to the anal
opening, hence improper toilet habits caneasily carry faecal bacteria into the urethra.
The urethral mucosa is continuous with the
urinary tract and the inflammation of the
urethra (urethritis) can ascend the tract
to cause bladder inflammation (cystitis)
or even renal inflammation (pyelitis or
pyelonephritis). Symptoms include dysuria
(painful urination), urinary urgency, fever
and sometimes cloudy or blood tinged
urine. When the kidneys are inflammed,
back pain and severe headache often occur.
Most urinary tract infections can be treated
by antibiotics.


**Renal Failure (Kidney Failure)**

Failure of the kidneys to excrete wastes
may lead to accumulation of urea with
marked reduction in the urine output.
Renal failure are of two types, Acute and
chronic renal failure. In acute renal failure
the kidney stops its function abruptly, but
there are chances for recovery of kidney
functions. In chronic renal failure there
is a progressive loss of function of the
nephrons which gradually decreases the
function of kidneys.

**Uremia**

Uremia is characterized by increase in
urea and other non-protein nitrogenous
substances like uric acid and creatinine in
blood. Normal urea level in human blood
is about 17-30mg/100mL of blood. The urea
concentration rises as 10 times of normal
levels during chronic renal failure.

**Renal calculi**

Kidney stone or calculi, also called renal
stone or nephrolithiasis, is the formation of
hard stone like masses in the renal tubules
of renal pelvis. It is mainly due to the
accumulation of soluble crystals of salts of
sodium oxalates and certain phosphates.

![Excreation](/books/biology/unit-3/excreation/ex10.png )

This result in severe pain called “renal colic
pain” and can cause scars in the kidneys.
Renal stones can be removed by techniques
like pyleothotomy or lithotripsy.

**Glomerulonephritis**

It is also called Bright’s disease and is
characterized by inflammation of the glomeruli
of both kidneys and is usually due to post-
streptococcal infection that occurs in children.
Symptoms are haematuria, proteinuria, salt
and water retention, oligouria, hypertension
and pulmonary oedema.

### **8.8 Haemodialysis**

Malfunctiong of the kidneys can lead
to accumalation of urea and other toxic
substances, leading to kidney failure. In such
patients toxic urea can be removed from the
blood by a process called haemodialysis. A
dialyzing machine or an artificial kidney is
connected to the patient’s body. A dialyzing
machine consists of a long cellulose tube
surrounded by the dialysing fluid in a water
bath. The patient’s blood is drawn from a
conveinent artery and pumped into the
dialysing unit after adding an anticoagulant
like heparin. The tiny pores in the dialysis
tube allows small molecules such as glucose,
salts and urea to enter into the water bath,
whereas blood cells and protein molecules
do not enter these pores. This stage is similar
to the filtration process in the glomerulus.
The dialysing liquid in the water bath
consists of solution of salt and sugar in
correct proportion in order to prevent loss
of glucose and essential salts from the blood.
The cleared blood is then pumped back to
the body through a vein Figure 8.10.


**Kidney Transplantation**

It is the ultimate method for correction
of acute renal failures. This involves transfer
of healthy kidney from one person (donor)
to another person with kidney failure. The
donated kidney may be taken from a healthy
person who is declared brain dead or from
sibling or close relatives to minimise the
chances of rejection by the immune system
of the host. Immunosuppressive drugs are
usually administered to the patient to avoid
tissue rejection.

The world’s first
successful human
kidney transplantation
was performed from
one twins to antoher by Joseph
E. Murray and his colleagues at Peter
Bent Brigham Hospital, Boston in 1954.
The first ever human kidney transplant
performed in India was done at the
King Edward Memorial Hospital at
Mumbai in May 1965, using a cadaver
donor in a non-renal failure patient
who had had hypernephroma. The first
successful live donor kidney transplant
in India was done at Christian
Medical College Hospital, Vellore
in January 1971 by Dr. Johnny and
Dr. Mohan Rao.

### **Summary**

Epithelial tissues are the interface
between internal fluids and the external
environment, creating osmotic barriers
in lower organisms. Other specialized
epithelial tissues that mediate osmotic and
ionic regulation are gills, digestive tract and
specialized excretory tissues in different
animal groups. Animals remove toxic
ammonia to less toxic forms by excretion.
Three main strategies of nitrogen excretion
are ammonoteles (ammonium), Uricoteles
(uric acid) and Ureotelism (Urea). Most
aquatic animals are ammonotelic, whereas
terrestrial animals are uricotelic (reptiles
and birds) or ureoteles (mammals). Urea is
produced by the Ornithine cycle/Urea cycle
in the liver.

Invertebrates have primitive kidneys
such as protonephridia and metanephridia.
Water balance in insects is regulatedby Malphigian tubules. Ion and water
regulation in vertebrates are carried out by
the kidneys. The functional units of kidney is
the nephron. Urine is formed by 3 processes,
Glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption
and tubular secretion. Filtration occurs
at the glomerulus, a ball of capillaries
surrounded by the Bowman’s capsule. From
the Bowman’s capsule the primary urine
enters the proximal tubule, and proceeds
to the loop of Henle, with its ascending and
descending limbs. The hypertonic fluid then
flows to the distal tubule and through the
collecting duct into the ureters, the urinary
bladder, after a short storage it is sent out of
the urethra. Central to the nephron is the
counter current system set up between the
loop of Henle and the collecting duct along
with the capillaries that serve the nephron.


Kidney function is regulated at different
levels. GFR is affected by colloidal osmotic
pressure and capsular hydrostatic pressure
between the glomerulus and Bowman’s
capsule, surface area available for filtration
are the factors that affect filtration pressure.
The kidneys act only on the plasma, yet the
extra cellular fluid consists of both plasma
and interstitial fluid. The interstitial fluid is
the true internal fluid environment of the
body. Interstitial fluid is the only component
that comes in direct contact with the cells.
Thus by performing regulatory and excretory
roles on the plasma, the kidneys maintains
the proper interstitial fluid environment for
optimum cell functioning.


Various hormones control diuresis.
Vasopressin alters the permeability of the
collecting duct, the renin- angiotensin
system, sympathetic system and aldosterone
act together to regulate Na1, K1, water and
pressure balance.

Visit a nearby health center to observe the analysis of urine. Dip strips can be used to
test urine for a range of different factors such as pH, glucose, ketones and proteins.
Dip sticks used for detecting glucose contain two enzymes namely, glucose oxidase
and peroxidase. These two enzymes are immobilized on a small pad at one end of the
stick. The pad is immersed in urine. If the urine contains glucose, a brown coloured
compound is produced. The resulting colour pad is matched against a colour chart.
The colour does not indicate the current blood glucose concentrations.
