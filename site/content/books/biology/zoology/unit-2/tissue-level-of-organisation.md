into squamous epithelium, cuboidal
epithelium, columnar epithelium, ciliated
epithelium and pseudostratified epithelium
(Figure 3.2). The **squamous epithelium** is
made of a single thin layer of flattened cells
with irregular boundaries. They are found
in the kidney glomeruli, air sacs of lungs,
lining of heart, blood vessels and lymphatic
vessels and are involved in functions like
forming a diffusion boundary and filtration
in sites where protection is not important.
The **cuboidal epithelium** is made of a
single layer of cube like cells. This tissue
is commonly found in the kidney tubules,
ducts and secretory portions of small glands
and surface of the ovary. Its main functions
are secretion and absorption. The **columnar**
**epithelium**is composed of single layer of tall
cells with round to oval nuclei at the base. 
It lines the digestive tract from the stomach 
tothe rectum. The two modifications of this
lining are the presence of microvilli on the
apical surface of the absorptive cells and
Goblet cell which secretes the protective
lubricating mucus. The functions of this
epithelium include absorption, secretion
of mucus, enzymes and other substances.
If the columnar cells bear cilia on their free
surfaces they are called ciliated epithelium.
This ciliated type propels mucus by ciliary
actions and it lines the small bronchioles,
fallopian tubes and uterus. Nonciliated
type lines most of the digestive tract, gall
bladder and secretory ducts of glands.
Pseudo-stratified epithelial cells are
columnar, but unequal in size. Although the
epithelium is single layered yet it appears
to be multi-layered because the nuclei lie at
different levels in different cells. Hence, it is also
 called pseudostratified epithelium and

![](/books/biology/unit-7/tissu-level-of-organization/2.png)

its functions are protection, secretion and
absorption. Ciliated forms line the trachea
and the upper respiratory tract. The non
ciliated forms, line the epididymis, large
ducts of a glands and tracts of male urethra

Eczema, Psoriasis, Epithelial carcinoma
and severe asthma

{{< /box >}}

### Glandular epithelium


Some of the cuboidal or columnar
cells get specialized for secretion and are
called **glandular epithelium** (Figure 3.3).
They are mainly of two types: unicellular,
consisting of isolated glandular cells (goblet
cells of the **alimentary**
**canal**), and multicellular,
consisting of cluster of
cells (salivary gland). On
the basis of the mode of
pouring of their secretions,
glands are divided into
two categories namely
exocrine and endocrine
glands. **Exocrine glands**
secrete mucus, saliva,
earwax, oil, milk, digestive enzymes and
other cell products. These products are
released through ducts or tubes. In contrast
endocrine glands do not have ducts. Their
secretions called hormones are secreted
directly into the fluid bathing the gland. The
exocrine glands are classified as unicellular
and multicelluar glands. The multicelluar
glands are further classified based on
the structure as **simple and compound**
**glands**, based on their secretory units as
**tubular, alveolar (Acinus) and tubulo**
**alveolar**. Based on the mode of secretion
exocrine glands are classified as merocrine,
holocrine and apocrine.

**Compound epithelium** is made of more
than one layer (multi-layered) of cells and
thus has a limited role in secretion and
absorption(Figure 3.4). The compound
epithelia may be stratified and transitional.
Their main function is to provide protection
against chemical and mechanical stresses.
They cover the dry surface of the skin, the
moist surface of buccal cavity, pharynx,
inner lining of ducts of salivary glands and
of pancreatic ducts. There are four types of
compound epithelium namely, **stratified**
**squamous epithelium**, cuboidal epithelium,
columnar epithelium and transitional
epithelium. Stratified squamous
epithelium is of two types called **keratinized**
**type** which forms the dry epidermis of the
skin and the non keratinized type forms
the moist lining of the oesophagus, mouth,
conjunctiva of the eyes and vagina. **Stratified**
**cuboidal epithelium** mostly found in
the ducts of sweat glands and mammary
glands. Stratified columnar epithelium
has limited distribution in the body, found
around the lumen of the pharynx, male
urethra and lining of some glandular ducts.
**Transitional Epithelium** is found lining
the ureters, urinary bladder and part of the
urethra. This epithelium allows stretching
and is protective in function.
 All cells of the epithelium are held
together with little intercellular material.
In most of the animal tissues, specialized
junctions provide both structural and



![](/books/biology/unit-7/tissu-level-of-organization/4.png)

functional links between its individual cells.
Three types of cell junctions are found in
the epithelium and other tissues. These are
called as tight, adhering and gap junctions.
**Tight junctions** help to stop substances from
leaking across a tissue. **Adhering junctions**
perform cementing to keep neighbouring
cells together. **Gap junctions** facilitate the
cells to communicate with each other by
connecting the cytoplasm of adjoining cells,
for rapid transfer of ions, small molecules
and sometimes big molecules.

Stratified epithelia are “built” for
protection or to resist abrasion. What
are the simple epithelia better at?

### 3.3 Connective Tissue        
Connective tissue
develops from the mesoderm
and is widely distributed in
the body. There are three
main classes namely Loose
connective tissue, Dense
connective tissue and Specialized connective
tissue. Major functions of connective tissues
are **binding, support, protection, insulation**
**and transportation**

#### Components of connective tissue


    All connective tissues consist of three
main components namely fibres, ground
substance and cells. The **‘Fibres’** of
connective tissue provide support. Three
types of fibres are found in the connective
tissue matrix. They are **collagen, elastic**
and **reticular**fibres. Connective tissues are
of three types namely, **Loose connective**
**tissues** (Areolar, Adipose and Reticular) and
**Dense connective tissues** (dense regular,
dense irregular and elastic) and **Specialized**
**connective tissues** (cartilage, bone and
blood).                           

#### Loose connective tissues

In this tissue the cells and fibres are
loosely arranged in a semi fluid ground
substances. For example the **Areolar**
**connective tissue** beneath the skin acts as
a support framework for epithelium and
acts as a reservoir of water and salts for
the surrounding body tissues, hence aptly
called *tissue fluid*. It contains fibroblasts,
macrophages, and mast cells (Figure 3.5).
**Adipose tissue** is similar to areolar
tissue in structure and function and located
beneath the skin. Adipocytes commonly
called **adipose or fat cells** predominate and
account for 90% of this tissue mass. The
cells of this tissue store fats and the excess
nutrients which are not utilised immediately
are converted to fats and are stored in
tissues. Adipose tissue is richly vascularised
indicating its high metabolic activity. While
fasting, these cells maintain life by producing
and supplying energy as fuel. Adipose
tissues are also found in subcutaneous
tissue, surrounding the kidneys, eyeball,
heart, etc. Adipose tissue is called **‘white fat’**
or **white adipose tissue**. The adipose tissue
which contains abundant mitochondria is
called **‘Brown fat’** or **Brown adipose tissue**.
White fat stores nutrients whereas brown
fat is used to heat the blood stream to warm
the body. Brown fat produces heat by non-
shivering thermogenesis in neonates.
**Reticular connective tissue** resembles
areolar connective tissue, but, the matrix is
filled with fibroblasts called reticular cells.
It forms an internal framework (stroma)
that supports the blood cells (largely
lymphocytes) in the lymph nodes, spleen
and bone marrow.


#### Dense connective tissues

**(connective tissue proper)**

Fibres and fibroblasts are compactly
packed in the dense connective tissues.
Orientation of fibres show a regular or

irregular pattern and is called dense regular
and dense irregular tissues. **Dense regular**
**connective tissues** primarily contain collagen
fibres in rows between many parallel bundles
of tissues and a few elastic fibres. The major
cell type is **fibroblast**. It attaches muscles
and bones and withstands great tensile stress
when pulling force is applied in one direction.
This connective tissue is present in **tendons**,
that attach skeletal muscles to bones and
ligaments attach one bone to another. **Dense**
**irregular connective tissues** have bundles of
thick collagen fibres and fibroblasts which are
arranged irregularly. The major cell type is
the **fibroblast**. It is able to withstand tension
exerted in many directions and provides
structural strength. Some elastic fibres are
also present. It is found in the skin as the
leathery dermis and forms fibrous capsules
of organs such as kidneys, bones, cartilages,
muscles, nerves and joints.


**Elastic connective tissue** contains high
proportion of elastic fibres. It allows recoil
of tissues following stretching. It maintains
the pulsatile flow of blood through the
arteries and the passive recoil of lungs
following inspiration. It is found in the walls
of large arteries; ligaments associated with
**vertebral column** and within the walls of
the **bronchial tubes**.
**Specialised connective tissues** are
classified as cartilage, bones and blood. The
intercellular material of **cartilage** is solid
and pliable and resists compression. Cells
of this tissue (chondrocytes) are enclosed in
small cavities within the matrix secreted by
them (Figure 3.6). Most of the cartilages in
vertebrate embryos are replaced by bones in
adults. Cartilage is present in the tip of nose,
outer ear joints, ear pinna, between adjacent
bones of the vertebral column, limbs and
hands in adults.
**Bones** have a hard and non-pliable
ground substance rich in calcium salts and
collagen fibres which gives strength to the
bones. It is the main tissue that provides
structural frame to the body. Bones support
and protect softer tissues and organs. The
bone cells (osteocytes) are present in the
spaces called **lacunae**. Limb bones, such
as the long bones of the legs, serve weight-
bearing functions. They also interact with
skeletal muscles attached to them to bring
about movements. The bone marrow in
some bones is the site of production of
blood cells.
**Blood** is the fluid connective tissue
containing plasma, red blood cells (RBC),
white blood cells (WBC) and platelets. It
functions as the transport medium for the
cardiovascular system, carrying nutrients,
wastes, respiratory gases throughout the
body. You will learn more about blood in
Chapter 7.

### 3.4 Muscle Tissue

Each muscle is made of many long,
cylindrical fibres arranged in parallel arrays.
These fibres are composed of numerous
fine fibrils, called **myofibrils**. Muscle fibres
contract (shorten) in response to stimulation,
then relax (lengthen) and return to their
uncontracted state in a coordinated fashion.
In general muscles play an active role in all
the movements of the body.
Muscles are of three types, skeletal,
smooth and cardiac. **Skeletal muscle**
**tissue** is closely attached to skeletal bones.
In a typical muscle such as the biceps, the
striated (striped) skeletal muscle fibres are
bundled together in a parallel fashion. A
sheath of tough connective tissue encloses
several bundles of muscle fibres (You will
learn more about this in Chapter 9).
The **smooth muscle** fibres taper at both
ends (fusiform) and do not show striations
(Figure 3.7). Cell junctions hold them
together and they are bundled together
in a connective tissue sheath. The walls of
internal organs such as the blood vessels,
stomach and intestine contain this type
of muscle tissue. Smooth muscles are
‘involuntary’ as their functions cannot
be directly controlled. Unlike the smooth
muscles, skeletal muscles can be controlled
by merely thinking.
**Cardiac muscle tissu**e is a contractile
tissue present only in the heart. Cell junctions
fuse the plasma membranes of cardiac
muscle cells and make them stick together.
Communication junctions (intercalated
discs) at some fusion points allow the cells to
contract as a unit, i.e., when one cell receives
a signal to contract, its neighbours are also
stimulated to contract.

##### 3.5 Neural Tissue


Nervous tissue exerts the greatest control
over the body’s responsiveness to changing 
conditions. Neurons, the
unit of neural system are
excitable cells (Figure 3.8).
The neuroglial cells which
constitute the rest of the
neural system protect and
support the neurons. Neuroglia makes
up more than one-half of the volume of
neural tissue in our body.

![](/books/biology/unit-7/tissu-level-of-organization/8.png)


When a neuron is suitably stimulated,
an electrical disturbance is generated which
swiftly travels along its plasma membrane.
Arrival of the disturbance at the neuron’s
endings, or output zone, triggers events
that may cause stimulation or inhibition
of adjacent neurons and other cells (You
will study in detail in Chapter 10)

* 1. Parkinson’s disease: A degenerative
disorder of the nervous system that
affects movement, often including
tremors.
* 2. Alzheimer’s disease: It is a chronic
neurodegenerative disease which
includes the symptoms of difficulty in
remembering recent events, problems
with language, disorientation and
mood swings.

* 1. **Biopsyis** an examination of tissue or liquid
removed from a living body to discover the
presence, cause or extent of a disease.
* 2. **Autopsy** is a post-mortem (dissection of
a dead body) examination to discover the
cause of death or the extent of disease.

   The field of **Forensic science** effectively
uses the histological techniques to trace
out crimes.

### Summary

The body cells combine to form
four different types of tissues; epithelial,
connective, muscle and nervous tissues.
Though the cells of these tissues share
certain features in common, by no means
they are identical. They belong together
because they have basic fundamental
resemblances. The important concept to
carry away with you is that tissues, despite
their unique abilities, cooperate to keep the
body safe, healthy, viable and whole.
