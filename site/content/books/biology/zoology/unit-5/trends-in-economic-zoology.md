Zoology is a branch of science which deals
with the study of animals. For someone
who is interested in pursuing a career in
Zoology, there are several specializations
that the students can venture into.
There are physiologists, who study the
metabolic processes of animals; there are
taxonomists who deal with the naming
and the classification of animal species;
embryologist whose job is to study and focus

• Creating awareness on self
employment opportunities in
various fields
• Understands the economic
importance of earthworm,
honeybee, lac insect, silk worm,
fish, cattle and birds
• Knows the techniques and tools
required for various culture methods
• Learns to manage the culture practices

on the early developmental stages of animal
life. Zoology as a career as a number of
specializations and students are presented
with a plethora of career options once they
chose to be associated with this field. This
field is concerned with the preservation
and management of animal kingdom and a
career in it would mean that you are a part
of that responsibility. A zoologist might
even get to travel because the nature of his/
her job. Channels like National Geographic,
Animal Planet, and Discovery Channel are
in constant need of Zoologists for research
and documentaries. Zoologists are also
hired for zoos, wildlife services, botanical
gardens, conservation organizations,
national parks, nature reserves, universities,
laboratories, aquariums, animal clinics,
fisheries and aquaculture, museums,
research, pharmaceutical companies,
veterinary hospitals, etc.

If you want to be an entrepreneur you
have to learn the methods of culturing
farm animals and their importance, since
farm animals possess great economic
value. Since prehistoric time human
beings taken maximum advantage from
animals by keeping them under their
control through domestication. The
economic success of the industries, based
on animals and their products, depends
on the proper production, management
and development of the next generation
of farm animals.

### Scope of Zoology
Studying Zoology can provide self
employment opportunities and you can
become an entrepreneur. Economic
Zoology is a branch of science that deals
with economically useful animals. It
involves the study of application of animals
for human welfare. The need of Zoology is
not just to improve our economic condition
but also to provide food security and
provide employment opportunities. Based
on the economic importance, animals can
be categorized as:
1. Animals for food and food products
2. Economically beneficial animals
3. Animals of aesthetic importance
4. Animals for scientific research.

### Vermiculture
Vermiculture is the process of using
earthworms to decompose organic food
waste, into a nutrient-rich material
capable of supplying necessary nutrients
which helps to sustain plant growth. The
aim is to continually increase the number
of worms to have a sustainable harvest.
The excess worms can either be used to
expand a vermicomposting operation or
sold to customers. Vermicompost is the
primary goal of vermiculture. Technically,

the worm castings are pure worm waste
and are fine and nutrient rich organic
soil amendment. Vermicompost on the
other hand, is comprised of the castings,
bits of bedding and other organic matter.
Essentially, though the terms are used
interchangeably, they are both worm
manure and are valuable for improving
soil health. Applications of earthworm
in technology of composting and
bioremediation of soils and other activities
is called Vermitech (Sultan Ismail, 1992).

The disposal of solid wastes (bio-
degradable and non- biodegradable)

remains a serious challenge in most of the
countries. Earthworms play a vital role
in maintaining soil fertility; hence these
worms are called as “farmer’s friends”.
These are also called as “biological
indicators of soil fertility”. The reason
![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.2.png)

matter by the activity of the earthworms
and its elimination from its body is called
vermicast. It is a finely divided granular
material and is noted for its porosity,
aeration, drainage and moisture holding
capacity and serves as rich organic manure.

Earthworms are divided into two
major groups. The first group, the humus
formers, dwell on the surface and feed on
organic matter. They are generally darker
in colour. These worms are used for
vermicomposting. The second group, the
humus feeders, are burrowing worms that
are useful in making the soil porous, and
mixing and distributing humus through
out the soil. There are different endemic
(native) species of earthworms cultured
in India for vermicomposting such as
Periyonyx excavatus, Lampito mauritii,
Octochaetona serrata. Some earthworm
species have been introduced from other
countries and called as exotic species

### Vermicomposting
Vermicompost is the
compost produced by the
action of earthworms in
association with all other
organisms in the compost
unit. Vermicompost bed may be selected
on upland or an elevated level as it prevents
the stagnation of water. You may construct
a cement pit of 3x2x1m size (LxWxD) over
ground surface using bricks. The size of pit
may vary as per availability of raw materials.
Cement pot or well rings are practically
good. Provision should be made for excess
water to drain. The vermibed should not be
exposed to direct sunlight and hence shade
may be provided (Figure. 12.1). The first
layer of vermibed contains gravel at about
5 cm in height, followed by coarse sand to
a thickness of 3.5 cm, which will facilitate
the drainage of excess water.

Earthworms collected from native soil
prefer a layer of local soil in their compost
beds. If local soil earthworms are used, add
a layer of native loamy soil for about 15 cm
               
![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.3.png)

of vermibed. It is useful as a foliar spray
to enhance plant growth and yield. It is
obtained from the burrows or ***drilospheres***
formed by earthworms. Nutrients, plant
growth promoter substances and some useful
microorganisms are present in vermiwash.
Earthworms can be used for recycling
of waste food, leaf, litter and biomass
![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.4.png)

***Earthworm Pests and Diseases***
Earthworms are subjected to attack by
a variety of pests. Most outbreaks are the
result of poor bed management. Earthworm
enemies include ants, springtails, centipedes,
slugs, mites, certain beetle larvae, birds,
rats, snakes, mice, toads, and other insects
or animals which feed on worms. The
earthworm has a number of internal
parasites including numerous protozoa,
some nematodes, and the larvae of certain
flies. Larger predators can be excluded from
worm beds by proper construction of the
bins, and by use of screens or gratings at the![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.5.png)

tackle the menace as I do not want to
use any chemicals?

### Advantages of Using Vermicompost
People are aware about benefits of organic
inputs in farming. Vermicompost is excellent
organic manure for sustainable agro-
practices. So, marketing vermicompost is
now a potential and flourishing industry.
Retail marketing of vermicompost in urban
areas is most promising. Vermicompost
is neatly packed in designed and printed
packets for sale. People of different age groups
are involved in the production and selling of
vermicompost. Marketing of vermicompost
can provide a supplementary income.
* Vermicompost is rich in essential plant
nutrients.
* It improves soil structure texture,
aeration, and water holding capacity
and prevents soil erosion
* Vermicompost is a rich in nutrients
![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.7.png)
and an eco-friendly amendment to soil
for farming and terrace gardening.
iv. It enhances seed germination and
ensures good plant growth

### Sericulture
Silk is Nature’s gift to mankind and a
commercial fiber of animal origin other than
wool. Being eco-friendly, biodegradable
and self-sustaining material; silk has
assumed special relevance in present age.
Sericulture is an agro –based industry, the
term which denotes commercial production
of silk through silkworm rearing. Historical
evidence reveals that sericulture was
practiced in China long back and they
preserved the secret for more than 3000 years
and maintained monopoly in silk trade with
the rest of the world. According to Western
historians, mulberry cultivation spread to
India about 140BC from China through
Tibet. The fabulous silk from China and
India were carried to European countries.
The 7000 mile lengthy road, historically
called the “Silk road” passing through
Baghdad, Tashkent, Damascus and Istanbul
was used for silk transport. Today more
than 29 countries in the world are practicing
sericulture and producing different kinds of
silk. India stands second in silk production
next to China.
Production of silk from the silk worm,
by rearing practices on a commercial

### Different types of Silkworm
   scale is called sericulture. It is an agro-
based industry comprising three main
components: i) cultivation of food plants
for the silkworms, ii) rearing of silkworms,
and iii) reeling and spinning of silk. The 


first two are agricultural and the last one is
an industrial component. Only few species
of silkworms are used in the sericulture
industry (Table 12. 1 and Figure 12. 2).
Life cycle of Bombyx mori
The adult of Bombyx mori is about 2.5 cm in
length and pale creamy white in colour. Due
to heavy body and feeble wings, flight is not
possible by the female moth. This moth is
unisexual in nature and does not feed during
its very short life period of 2-3 days. Just after
emergence, male moth copulates with female
for about 2-3 hours and if not separated, they
may die after few hours of copulating with
female. Just after copulation, female starts
egg laying which is completed in1-24 hours.
A single female moth lays 400 to 500 eggs
depending upon the climatic conditions.
Two types of eggs are generally found namely
diapause type and non-diapause type. The
diapause type is laid by silkworms inhabiting
the temperate regions, whereas silkworms
belonging to subtropical regions like India
lay non-diapause type of eggs. The eggs after
ten days of incubation hatch into larva called
Figure 12.2 Different types of silkworms as caterpillar. The newly hatched caterpillar is

Artificial food for fishes: In this
system plant waste and decays are utilized
by fishes as food. So, the need for the use
of supplementary feed can be minimized.

   about 3 mm in length and is pale, yellowish-
white in colour. The caterpillars are provided

with well developed mandibulate type of
mouth-parts adapted to feed easily on the
mulberry leaves.
After 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th moultings
caterpillars get transformed into 2nd, 3rd, 4th
and 5th instars respectively (Figure12.3). It
takes about 21 to 25 days after hatching. The
fully grown caterpillar is 7.5 cm in length.
It develops salivary glands, stops feeding
and undergoes pupation. The caterpillars
stop feeding and move towards the corner
among the leaves and secretes a sticky fluid
through their silk gland. The secreted fluid
comes out through spinneret (a narrow pore
situated on the hypopharynx) and takes
the form of long fine thread of silk which
hardens on exposure to air and is wrapped
around the body of caterpillar in the forms

of a covering called as cocoon.
It is the white coloured bed of
the pupa whose outer threads
are irregular while the inner
threads are regular. The length
of continuous thread secreted
by a caterpillar for the
formation of cocoon is about
1000-1200 metres which
requires 3 days to complete.
The pupal period lasts for
10 to 12 days and the pupae
cut through the cocoon and
emerge into adult moth.
On the basis of the
moults which they undergo
during their larval life, B.
mori is divided into three

races – tri-moulters, tetra-
moulters and penta-
moulters. Based on

voltinism (the number of broods raised
per year), three kinds of races are
recognized in mulberry silkworm –![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.8.png)
![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.9.png)
univoltines (one brood only), bivoltines
(two broods only) and multivoltines
(more than two broods).

India has the distinction of producing
all the four types of silk i.e. (a) Mulberry
silk (91.7%); (b) Tasar silk (1.4%);
(c) Eri silk (6.4%); and (d) Muga silk
(0.5%) which are produced by different
species of silkworms. Name the species
that produces large amount and least
amount of silk in India.

### Cultivation of food plants for the
   The first component, is to grow the food
plants for the silkworms. Mulberry leaves
are widely used as food for silkworm
Bombyx mori and the cultivation of
mulberry is called as Moriculture.
Presently improved mulberry varieties
like Victory1, S36, G2 and G4 which can
withstand various agro - climatic and
soil conditions are used for planting.
The favourable season for cultivating
of the mulberry plants is June, July,
November and December. The mulberry
crop production technology includes![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.8.png)
![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.9.png)
land preparation, preparation of cutting,
planting techniques, maintenance of
mulberry nursery, disease and pest
management and uprooting for raising
new mulberry gardens. Mulberry is also
being grown as tree plant at an height of
123-152 cm with 20 x 20 cm or 25 x 25
cm spacing to harvest better silkworm
cocoon crops.
### Rearing of silkworms
  The second component is the rearing of
silkworm. A typical rearing house (6m x
4m x 3.5m) is constructed on an elevated
place under shade to accommodate 100
dfls (disease free layings). Space of 1m
should be provided surrounding the
rearing house. Sufficient windows and![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.8.png)
![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.9.png)
ventilators should be provided for free
circulation of air inside the rearing house.
The windows and ventilators should be
covered with nylon net to restrict the entry
of uzi flies and other insects. Apart from
the specified area of the rearing house; the
following appliances such as hygrometer,
power sprayers, rearing stands, foam pads,
wax coated paraffin papers, nylon nets,
baskets for keeping leaves, gunny bags,
rotary or bamboo mountages and drier are
needed for effective rearing of silkworms.
The steps involved in rearing process of

silkworm are disinfection of rearing house,
incubation of eggs, brushing, young larval
rearing and late age larval rearing.
The selected healthy silk moths are
allowed to mate for 4 hours. Female moth is
then kept in a dark plastic bed, it lays about
400 eggs in 24 hours; the female is taken out,
crushed and examined for any disease, only
certified disease-free eggs are reared for
industrial purpose. The eggs are incubated in
an incubator. The small larvae (caterpillars)
hatch between 7-10 days. These larvae are
kept in trays inside a rearing house at a
temperature of about 20°C - 25°C. These are
first fed on chopped mulberry leaves. After
4-5 days fresh leaves are provided. As the
larvae grow, they are transferred to fresh
leaves on clean trays, when fully grown they
spin cocoons. Their maturity is achieved
in about 45 days. At this stage the salivary
glands

### Post cocoon processing
The method of obtaining silk thread
from the cocoon is known as post cocoon
processing. This includes stifling and
reeling.
The process of killing the cocoons is
called stifling. The process of removing
the threads from the killed cocoon is called
reeling. For reeling silk the cocoons are
gathered about 8 -10 days after spinning
had begun. The cocoons are first treated
by steam or dry heat to kill the insect
inside. This is necessary to prevent the
destruction of the continuous fibre by the
emergence of the moth. The cocoons are
then soaked in hot water (95° -97°C) for
10-15 minutes to soften the gum that binds
the silk threads together. This process is
called cooking. The “cooked” cocoons
are kept in hot water and the loose ends
of the thread are caught by hand. Threads
from several cocoons are wound together
on spinning wheels (Charakhas) to form

the reels of raw silk. Only about one-
half of the silk of each cocoon is reelable,

the remainder is used as a silk waste
and formed into spun silk. Raw silk thus
obtained is processed through several
treatments to bring about the luster on the
thread.

### Uses of Silk
* Silk fibers are utilized in preparing silk
clothes. Silk fibers are now combined
with other natural or synthetic fibers
to manufacture clothes like Teri-Silk,
Cot-Silk etc. Silk is dyed and printed
to prepare ornamented fabrics. They
are generally made from Eri-silk or
spun silk.
* Silk is used in industries and for
military purposes.
* It is used in the manufacture of fishing
fibers, parachutes, cartridge bags,
insulation coils for telephone, wireless
![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.13.png)
receivers, tyres of racing cars, filter
fibres, in medical dressings and as
suture materials.

### Diseases and Pests of Silkworm:
   The profitable silk industry is threatened
by various diseases caused by the virus,
fungal, bacterial and protozoan infections
but also by insect predators, birds and
other higher animals. Ants, crows, kites,
rats, feed upon silk worms thereby
causing a great loss to silk industry.
Pebrine, is a dangerous disease to in
silkworms and the causative organism
is Nosema bombycis , a protozoan. This
silkworm disease is transmitted through
the egg of the mother silkworm and also
through ingestion of contaminated food.
Flacherie generally occurs in the mature
larvae and is caused mainly by bacteria
like Streptococcus and Staphylococcus.
Grasserie is a most dominant and serious
viral disease. It is caused by Bombyx mori
nuclear polyhedrosis virus (BmNPV) a
Baculovirus, which belongs to sub group
‘A’ of the Baculoviridae. Among the fungal
diseases, white muscardine is common.
This disease is caused by fungus Beauveria
bassiana.
### Apiculture
 Ever since the beginning
of civilization, man has
been trying to make use
of organisms around him
for various purposes and to rear them for
increasing their number. One of the finest
discoveries is our knowledge regarding the
procurement of honey collected by honey
bees. Care and management of honey bees
on a commercial scale for the production of
honey is called Apiculture or Bee Keeping.
The word ‘apiculture’ comes from the Latin
word ’apis’ meaning bee. Bees are reared
in apiaries that are areas where a lot of bee
hives can be placed. There are five well
recognized types of bees in the world. They
are Apis dorsata (Rock bee), Apis florea
(Little bee), Apis indica (Indian bee), Apis
mellifera (European bee) and Apis adamsoni
(African bee).
### Social organization of honey bees
In honey bees, a highly organized division
of labour is found. A well developed
honey bee colony consists of the Queen,
![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.14.png)
Drones and Workers (Figure 12.4). All the
three types depend on each other for their
existence. There is normally one queen,
10,000 to 30,000 workers and few hundred
drones (male bees) in a colony.
Queen bee is a functional female bee
present in each hive and feeds on Royal Jelly.
Its sole function is to lay eggs throughout its
life span. The virgin queen bee mates only
once in her life. During the breeding season
![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.15.png)
in winter, a unique flight takes place by the
queen bee followed by several drones. This
flight is called “nuptial flight”. The queen
bee produces a hormonal chemical substance
called pheromone. The drones in the area are

attracted to the pheromone and mating takes
place. During mating, the drone releases large
number of sperms for sufficient fertilization.
In a life span of two to four years, a queen bee
lays about 15 lakh eggs. When the queen bee
loses its capacity to lay eggs, another worker
bee starts feeding on the Royal Jelly and
develops into a new queen.
Among the honey bees, workers are
sterile females and smallest but yet function
as the main spring of the complicated
machinery in the colony. Worker bee lives
in a chamber called ‘Worker Cell’ and it
takes about 21 days to develop from the egg
to adult and its lifespan is about six weeks.
Each worker has to perform different types
of work in her life time. During the first half
of her life, she becomes a nurse bee attending
to indoor duties such as secretion of royal
jelly, prepares bee-bread to feed the larvae,
feeds the queen, takes care of the queen and
drones, secretes bees wax, builds combs,
cleans and fans the bee hive.

![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.16.png)

![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.17.png)


Then she becomes a soldier and guards
the bee hive. In the second half her life lasting
for three weeks, she searches and gathers the
pollen, nectar, propolis and water.
The drone is the functional male
member of the colony which develops from
an unfertilized egg. It lives in a chamber
called drone cell. Drones totally depend on
workers for honey. The sole duty of the drone
is to fertilize the virgin queen hence called
“King of the colony”. During swarming (the
process of leaving the colony by the queen
with a large group of worker bees to form a
new colony) the drones follows the queen,
copulates and dies after copulation.

### Structure of a Bee Hive
  The house of honey bee is termed as bee
hive or comb. The hive consists of
hexagonal cells made up of wax secreted
by the abdomen of worker bees arranged
in opposite rows on a common base. These
hives are found hanging vertically from
the rocks, building or branches of trees.
The young stages of honey bees
accommodate the lower and central cells
of the hive called the brood cells. In Apis
dorsata, the brood cells are of similar in
size and shape but in other species, brood
cells are of three types viz., queen cell

### Methods of Bee keeping
The main objective is to get more and
more quality honey. There are two
methods used by apiculturists. They are
indigenous method and the modern
method. In indigenous method, the honey
extracted from the comb contains wax. To
overcome the drawbacks of the indigenous
method, the modern method has been
developed to improve the texture of hives.
In India, there are two types of beehives in
practice namely, Langstroth and Newton.

![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.18.png)
The Langstroth bee hive is made up
of wood and consists of six parts (Figure
12.6) namely Stand, Bottom board,
Brood chamber, Super, Inner cover and
Top cover. Besides the above primary
equipments, other accessory equipments
are used in beekeeping. They are Queen
Excluder, Comb foundation, Bee gloves,
Bee veil, Smoker, Hive Tool, Uncapping
knife, Bee brush, Queen introducing
cage, Feeder, Honey Extractor and Hive


### Products of bee keeping and their
### economic importance
The chief products of bee keeping industry
are honey and bee wax.

***Honey*** is the healthier substitute for
sugar. The major constituents of honey are:
levulose, dextrose, maltose, other sugars,
enzymes, pigments, ash and water. It is an
aromatic sweet material derived from nectar
of plants. It is a natural food, the smell and
taste depends upon the pollen taken by the
honey bee. It is used as an antiseptic, laxative
and as a sedative. It is generally used in
Ayurvedic and Unani systems of medicine.![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.10.png)

![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.11.png)
   ### Life cycle of Bombyx mori
It is also used in the preparation of cakes,
breads and biscuits

Bee wax is secreted by the abdomen of
the worker bees at the age of two weeks.
The wax is masticated and mixed with
the secretions of the cephalic glands to
convert it into a plastic resinous substance.
The resinous chemical substance present
in the wax is called propolis which is
derived from pollen grains. The pure wax
is white in colour and the yellow colour
is due to the presence of carotenoid
pigments. It is used for making candles,
water proofing materials, polishes for

floors, furniture, appliances, leather and
taps. It is also used for the production of
comb foundation sheets in bee keeping
and used in pharmaceutical industries.
Bees teach us a
lesson to work with
cooperation. Imagine
the hardwork of
the bees! A single honey bee travels
about double the distance of the
circumference of the earth’s globe for
preparing 453.5ml of honey.
12.5 Lac Culture
The culture of lac insect using techniques
for the procurement of lac on large
scale is known as Lac culture. Lac is
produced by the lac insect Tachardia
lacca previously known as Laccifer lacca.
It is a minute, resinous crawling scale
insect which inserts its probosics into
the plant tissues and sucks juice, grows
and secretes lac from the hind end of the
body as a protective covering for its body.
Moreover the insect is a parasite on host
plants i.e., Karanagalli (Acacia catechu),
Karuvelai (Acacia nilotica) and Kumbadiri
(Schleichera oleosa). The quality of lac
depends upon the quality of the host
plant. The female lac insect is responsible
for large scale production of lac, which is
larger than the male lac insect.


### Economic importance of Lac
  * Lac is largely used as a sealing wax
and adhesive for optical instruments.
It is used in electric industry, as it is a
good insulator.
* It is used in preparations of shoe and
leather polishes and as a protective
coating of wood.
* It is used in laminating paper board,
photographs, engraved materials and
plastic moulded articles.
* Used as a filling material for gold
### Aquaponics
Aquaponics is a technique which is a
combination of aquaculture (growing fish)
and hydroponics (growing plants in non-soil
media and nutrient-laden water).Aquaponics
may also prevent toxic water runoff. It also
maintains ecosystem balance by recycling the
waste and excretory products produced by
the fish. In India, aquaponics was started in
2013. Some primary methods of aquaponic
gardening that are in use nowadays are as
follows: * Deep water culture is otherwise
known as raft based method. In this method
a raft floats in water. Plants are kept in the
holes of raft and the roots float in water. This
method is applicable for larger commercial
scale system. By this method fast growing
plants are cultivated. * Media based
method involves growing plants in inert
planting media like clay pellets or shales. This
method is applicable for home and hobby
scale system. Larger number of fruiting
plants, leafy green plants, herbs and other
varieties of plants can be cultivated (Figure
* Nutrient Film technique involves
the passage of nutrient rich water through a
narrow trough or PVC pipe. Plants are kept
in the holes of the pipe to allow the roots to be

in free contact with in the water stream. (iv)
Aqua vertica is otherwise known as vertical
aquaponics. Plants are stacked on the top of
each other in tower systems. Water flows in
through the top of the tower. This method is
suitable for growing leafy greens, strawberries
and other crops that do not need supporting
solid substratum to grow.

### Advantages of Aquaponic gardening
No need of water
discharge and recharge as the water is
maintained by recycling process.
Bottom soil may be loaded with
freshwater. Microbes in water can convert
the waste materials into usable forms like
ammonia into nitrates which are used
by the plants. Thus the soil fertility is
maintained
Pesticides: In this system use of

pesticides is avoided and hence it is eco-
friendly.

   Growing fish or other aquatic
animals and plants together in an
integrated system. The fish wastes
provides nutrients for the plants
and the plants filter the water.
Additionally bacteria break down
by-products such as ammonia.
b. Growing plants in a nutrient solution
instead of soil. Fish kept in the water
provide the required nutrients.

### Fertilizer usage:
Artificial or
chemical fertilizers is not required for this
system since the plants in the aquaponics
utilize the nutrients from the fish wastes
dissolved in water
![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.15.png)
koi, gold fish, bass
etc., are cultured in
aquaponics. Common
cultivable plants like
tomato, pepper,
lettuce, cucumber, and
rose are co-cultivated
in this method.

### Aquaculture
Aquaculture has been
practiced in varying
forms for centuries![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.15.png)
dating to the time of
the Phoenicians. India
offers a huge potential
for aquaculture
development. Fish
culture received
notable attention
in Tamil Nadu in 1911. Aquaculture is
a branch of science that deals with the
farming of aquatic organisms such as fish,
molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants.
On the basis of source, aquaculture can
be classified into three categories. They are
### (a) Freshwater aquaculture (b) Brackish
water aquaculture (c) Marine water 
### aquaculture.
Culturing of fishes is called
fish culture or pisciculture. Inland water
bodies include freshwater bodies like rivers,
canals, streams, lakes, flood plain wetlands,
reservoirs, ponds, tanks and other derelict
water bodies and ponds constructed for
fresh water aquaculture. The pH of the
freshwater should be around neutral and
salinity below 5 ppt (parts per thousand).
Brackish water fishes spend most of
its life in river mouths (estuaries) back

waters, mangrove swamps and coastal
lagoons. Estuarine fish are more common
in Bengal and Kerala. Culturing of
animals in the water having salinity range![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.15.png)
0.5 2 30 ppt are called as brackish water
culture. Fishes cultured in brackish water
are Milk fish (Chanos Chanos), Sea bass
(‘Koduva’), Grey mullet (‘Madavai’), Pearl
spots (‘Kari’meen) etc,
Marine Fisheries deal with fishing
operations along seacoasts. The Indian
subcontinent approximately has a 5600 kms
long coastline. About 80% of India’s marine
fish are supplied by the west coast and
the remaining 20% by the east coast. The
premier varieties are mackerels, sardines,
sharks, and catfish. Marine edible fishes of
Tamilnadu coast include both cartilaginous
and bony fishes. Culturing of animals in the
water salinity ranges from 30 - 35 ppt is called
Mariculture. Some fishes like Chanos sp,
Mugil cephalus are cultured here. Culturing
of animals in the salinity ranges from 36
- 40 ppt is called Metahaline culture. Eg,![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.15.png)
Brine shrimp (Artemia salina). Artemia is
commonly known as the brine shrimp. It is
a crustacean and lives in high saline waters
because of its high osmoregulatory capacity.

### Fish culture
### Characteristics of cultivable fishes

The special characteristic features of
cultivable fishes are:
* Fishes should have high growth rate in
short period for culture.
* They should accept supplementary diet.
* They should be hardy enough to resist
some common diseases and infection
of parasites.
* Fishes proposed for polyculture
should be able to live together without
interfering or attacking other fishes.

* They should have high conversion
efficiency so that they can effectively
utilize the food.
### Types of cultivable fish
Cultivable fish are of 3 types(Figure 12. 8).
* Indigenous or native fresh water fishes
(Major carps, Catla, Labeo, Clarias)
* Salt water fishes acclimatized for fresh
water (Chanos, Mullet).
* Exotic fishes or imported from other
counties (Common carps)
Among these, major carps have proved to
be best suited for culture in India, because
the carps
* Feed on zooplavnktons and
phytoplanktons, decaying weeds,
debris and other aquatic plants.
*They can survive in turbid water with
slightly higher temperature
* Can tolerate O2 variations in water.
* Can be transported from one place to
other easily.
* They are highly nutritive and palatable.

### External factors affecting fish culture
The factors that affect fish culture are
temperature, light, rain, water, flood,
water current, turbidity of water, pH
hardness, salinity and dissolved O2. Light
and temperature also play an important
role in fish breeding.
### Management of fish farm
To culture fish, one should have an idea
about different stages of fish culture such
as topographic situation, quality, source,
physical, chemical and biological factors
of water. Breeding, hatching, nursing,
rearing and stocking fishes in ponds has
to be managed properly. Keeping in view
the various stages of fishes, the following
different types of ponds have been
recommended to manage them.
### Breeding pond
The first step in fish culture is the breeding of
fishes, therefore, for proper breeding special
types of ponds are prepared called breeding
ponds. These ponds are prepared near the
rivers or other natural water resources.
### Types of breeding
Depending on the mode of breeding, they
are divided into
### Natural breeding
These are special types of ponds where
natural riverine conditions or any natural
water resources are managed for breeding
of culturable fishes. There bundhs are
constructed in large low-lying areas that
can accommodate large quantity of rain
water. The shallow area of such bundhs is
used as spawning ground.
### Induced breeding
that all fish seeds belong to the same
species. Hence advanced techniques
have been developed to improve the
quality of fish seed by artificial method
of fertilization and induced breeding.
Artificial fertilization involves removal of
ova and sperm from female and male by
artificial mechanical process and the eggs
are fertilized. For artificial fertilization
the belly of mature female fish is held
upward. Stripping is done with the thumb
of the right hand from the anterior to
posterior direction for the ejection of eggs
due to force. In this way eggs are collected
separately. Further, the male fish is caught
with its belly downwards. The milt of fish
is striped and collected separately, and
then the eggs are fertilized.
Induced breeding is also done by
hypophysation (removal of pituitary gland).
The gonadotropin hormone (FSH and LH)
secreted by the pituitary gland influences
the maturation of gonads and spawning
in fishes. Pituitary gland is removed from
a healthy mature fish. Pituitary extract
is prepared by homogenising in 0.3%
saline or glycerine and centrifuged for
15 minutes at 8000rpm. The supernatant
is injected intramuscularly at the base of
the caudal fin or intra-peritonealy at the
base of pectoral fin. Male and female
fishes start to spawn (release of gametes)
and eggs are fertilized. The fertilized eggs
are removed from the spawning place and
kept into hatching hapas.
Fish seed
Fish seed is collected from breeding ponds.
The spawn collecting net is commonly
called Benchijal (Shooting net) and
transferred to the hatching pits

### Hatching pit
The fertilized eggs are kept in hatching
pits. The hatching pits should be nearer
to the breeding grounds, should be
smaller in size with good quality water.
There are two types of hatching pits,
hatcheries are small sized pond in which
unfertilized eggs are transferred and
hatching happens. Hatching hapas are
rectangular trough shaped tanks made
up of mosquito net cloth supported by
bamboo poles and fixed in the river

![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.13.png)

### Nursery pond
The newly hatched fries are transported
from the hatching happa to nursery ponds
where they grow into fingerlings.
### Rearing pond
Fingerlings are transferred to rearing
ponds that is long and narrow and allows
long distance swimming. The rearing
pond should be free from toxicants and
predators. Antibiotics are used for washing
### the fingerlings and then transferred to the
stocking ponds.
Stocking ponds
Stocking ponds should be devoid of weeds
and predatory fishes. Proper organic

manuring should be done to increase the
production with cow dung and chemical
fertilizing should also be done.
### Harvesting
Harvesting is done to capture the fishes
from the water. Well grown fishes are
taken out for marketing. Small sized fishes
are again released into the stocking ponds
for further growth. Different methods of
fishing are carried out to harvest fishes.
These include Stranding, Angling, Traps,
Dipnets, Cast nets, Gill nets, Drag nets
and purse nets. The harvested fishes are
preserved by refrigeration, Deep freezing,
freeze drying, sun drying, salting, smoking
and canning.
### Composite fish farming
Few selected fishes belonging to different
species are stocked together in proper
proportion in a pond. This mixed farming
is termed composite fish farming or
polyculture. The advantages include,
* All available niches are fully utilized.
* Compatible species do not harm each other.
* No competition among different
species is found.
* Catla catla, Labeo rohita and Cirrhinus
mrigala are the commonly used fish
species for composite fish farming.
### Exotic fishes
The fishes imported into a country for
fish culture are called exotic fishes and
such fish culture is known as exotic fish
culture. Examples of such exotic fishes
introduced in India are Cyprinus carpio
and Oreochromis mossambicus.
Disease Management
Diseases can be of viral or bacterial
origin. Regular monitoring of parameters

like water quality, aeration, regular
feeding, observation for mortality should
be checked. Parasitic infestations and
microbial infections should be observed
periodically.
Economic importance of fish
Fishes frrm a rich source of protein food
and provide a good staple food to tide over
the nutritional needs of man. Fish species
such as sardines, mackerel, tuna, herrings
have high amino acids concentrations
particularly histidine which is responsible
for the meaty flavor of the flesh. It is rich
in fat such as omega 3 fatty acids. Minerals
such as calcium, magnesium, phosphorus,
potassium, iron, manganese, iodine and
copper. Some of the fish by - products are;
Fish oil is the most important fish
by product. It is derived from fish liver
and from the fish body. Fish liver oil is
derived from the liver which is rich in
vitamin A and D, whereas fish body oil
has high content of iodine, not suitable
for human consumption, but is used in
the manufacture of laundry soaps, paints
and cosmetics.
Fish meal is prepared from fish waste
after extracting oil from the fish. The dried
wastes are used to prepare food for pig,
poultry and cattle. The wastes obtained
during the preparation of fish meal are
widely used as manure.
Isinglass is a high-grade collagen
produced from dried air bladder or swim
bladder of certain fishes viz. catfish and
carps. The processed bladder which is
dissolved in hot water forms a gelatin
having adhesive property. It is primarily
used for clarification of wine, beer and
vinegar.

Why are fish so efficient at converting
feed to flesh?

### Prawn Culture
Most important aquatic crustacean is
prawn, which is widely cultured prawn
flesh is palatable and rich in glycogen,
protein with low fat content.
Types of prawn fishery
* Shallow water prawn fishery – located
on the west coast restricted to shallow
waters.
* Estuaries and back waters or saline lake
prawn fishery - The area of production
of prawns are the back waters seen
along the Western coast, Ennur,
Pulicat, Chilka lake and Estuaries of
Ganga and Brahmaputra rivers.
* Freshwater prawn fishery - Prawns
are caught from the rivers and lakes
throughout India.
* Marine prawn fishery – Most of the
marine prawns are caught along the
Indian coast belonging to the family
Penaeidae.
### Species of prawn
A number of species of prawn are distributed
in water resources such as Penaeus indicus,
Penaeus monodon, Metapenaeus dobsoni
and Macrobrachium rosenbergii.
Culture of freshwater prawn
Macrobrachium rosenbergii (Figure 12.10)

is commonly seen in rivers, fields and low-
saline estuaries. The prawn collected from

ponds, river, and paddy fields are
transferred to the tanks which are aerated.
For fertilization, one pair of prawn are kept
in a separate tank. After mating, the eggs
are laid. Spawning tanks of different sizes
should be prepared with proper aeration.
Temperature (240
C – 300
C) and pH (7-8)
should be maintained in the hatching tank.
The eggs hatch into first and second stage
larva. Artificial feed is supplied. Young
ones of 5cm length (60 days old) can be
reared in fresh or slightly brackish water
ponds and paddy fields. Harvesting of
prawns can be done twice in a year.
Quality of pearl
The pearls obtained are of variable shapes
and sizes. They may be white, or cream red
or pink red in colour. The spherical pearls
of rainbow colour are rarely found. The best
quality of pearl is obtained from marine
oysters. Pearl obtained from freshwater
bivalves are not as valuable as those obtained
from the marine oysters (Mishra, 1961).

that are useful to human beings. Parameters
such as adequate ventilation, temperature,
sufficient light, water and proper housing
accommodation should be taken into
account to maintain dairy and poultry
farms. Animals should be cared and
protected from diseases. Records should
be maintained after the regular visits by
Veterinarian. More over the selection of
good breeds with high yielding potential
combined and resistance to diseases is
very important.
Animal Breeding
Human beings have been depending on
animals and animal products for food from
very early times. Generally high yielding
animals produced by hybridization are
reared in poultry and dairy farms. In
earlier days, animals were produced and
selected based on specific characters. With
the gain in knowledge on the principles of
heredity and genetics, human beings have
been successful in rearing animals with the
superior qualities through hybridization
experiments. Complex issues are faced by

### Culture of marine ppdfrawn
Several factors that determine the success
of marine prawn culture includes selection
of site, water quality, soil quality and
availability of seed.
### Preparation of farm
For the preparation of ponds for algal
growth and for the subsequent stocking
of prawns it is essential to drain off the
water and sundry the bottom followed
by light tilling. Agricultural lime should
be applied to absorb excess CO2 and to
supply calcium which is required for
moulting. Fertilizers like rice, bran,
poultry, and cattle dung are used to
increase the fertility of the soil. Prawns
are commonly caught in crafts and gears
using different types of nets such as cast
nets, bag nets, drag nets, trawl nets and

Common diseases of cattle: A healthy
animal eat, drinks and sleeps well regularly.
Healthy cattle appear bright, alert and active
in their movement with a shiny coat. Cattle
are affected by a large number of diseases.
Cattle in ill health appear dull, restless and
change posture frequently with drop in milk
yield. The main diseases of dairy cattle are
rinderpest, foot and mouth disease, cow
pox, hemorrhagic fever, anthrax.
Uses of dairy products:
Milk products: Milk is produced by dairy
animals which is an emulsion of fat and
lactose. Milk also contains enzymes which
are destroyed during pasteurization. Milk
is a rich source of vitamin A, B1, B2, and
deficient in Vitamin C. Due to its high
nutrition value, it serves as a complete food
for infants. Dairy products such as yoghurt,
cheese, butter, ice cream, condensed milk,
curd, and milk powder processed from milk
make dairy, a highly farming attraction.
Meat: Meat is rich in protein and also
contains many minerals like iron, zinc,
vitamins and selenium. It also contains
vitamins needed for human diet.
Land management: Grazing of
livestock is sometimes used as a way to
control weeds and undergrowth.
Manure: Manure can be spread on
agriculture fields to increase crop yields.
Poultry Farming
The word poultry refers to the rearing and
propagation of avian species such as chicken,
ducks, turkeys, geese, quail and guinea
fowls. The most common and commercially
farmed birds are chicken and ducks. Poultry
farming is essential for the purpose of meat,
eggs and feather production. Commercial
poultry farming is also profitable. In this

part we are discussing about an overview
of the chicken and duck breeds, farming
practices and its advantages.
Types of Chicken breeds: There are more
than 100 breeds. The commonly farmed
chicken breeds are categorized into five
based on the purpose for which it is farmed.
They are egg layers, broiler type, dual type,
games and ornamental types (Figure 12.13).
1. Egg layers: These are farmed mainly
for the production of egg.
Leghorn: This is the most popular
commercial breed in India and originated
from Italy. They are small, compact with a
single comb and wattles with white, brown
or black colour. They mature early and begin
to lay eggs at the age of 5 or 6 months. Hence
these are preferred in commercial farms.
They can also thrive well in dry areas.
Chittagong: It is the breed chiefly
found in West Bengal. They are golden
or light yellow coloured. The beak is long
and yellow in colour. Ear lobes and wattles
are small and red in colour. They are good
egg layers and are delicious.
2. Broiler type: These are well known for
fast growth and soft quality meat.
White Plymouth rock: They have
white plumage throughout the body. It
is commonly used in broiler production.
This is an American breed. It is a fast
growing breed and well suitable for
growing intensively in confined farms.
3. Dual purpose breeds: These are for
both meat and egg production purpose.
Brahma: It is a breed popularly known
for its massive body having heavy bones,
well feathered and proportionate body.
Pea comb is one of the important breed
characters. It has two common varieties
namely, Light Brahma and Dark Brahma.
### uring hybridization
experiments. Hence animals with maximum
desirable characters should be selected.
A group of animals related by descent
and with similar characters like general
appearance, features, size etc., are said to
belong to a breed. Why should we breed
animals? Through animal breeding,
improved breeds of animals can be
produced by improving their genotype
through selective breeding.
Objectives of Animal breeding:
* To improve growth rate
* Enhancing the production of milk,
meat. Egg etc.,
* Increasing the quality of the animal
products
* Improved resistance to diseases
* Increased reproductive rate
Methods of Animal breeding:
There are two methods of animal breeding,
namely inbreeding and outbreeding
* Inbreeding: Breeding between animals
of the same breed for 4-6 generations is
called inbreeding. Inbreeding increases

homozygosity and exposes the harmful
recessive genes. Continuous inbreeding
reduces fertility and even productivity,
resulting in “inbreeding depression”.
This can be avoided by breeding selected
animals of the breeding population and
they should be mated with superior
animals of the same breed but unrelated
to the breeding population. It helps to
restore fertility and yield.
* Outbreeding: The breeding between
unrelated animals is called outbreeding.
Individuals produced do not have common
ancestors for 4-6 generations. Outbreeding
helps to produce new and favourable traits,
to produce hybrids with superior qualities
and helps to create new breeds. New and
favourable genes can be introduced into a
population through outbreeding.
* Out crossing: It is the breeding
between unrelated animals of the same
breed but having no common ancestry. The
offspring of such a cross is called outcross.
This method is suitable for breeding
animals below average in productivity.
* Cross breeding: Breeding between a
superior male of one breed with a superior
female of another breed. The cross bred
progeny has superior traits ( hybrid vigour
or heterosis.)
* Interspecific hybridization:
In this method of breeding mating is
between male and female of two different
species. The progeny obtained from such
crosses are different from their parents,
and may possess the desirable traits of the
parents. Have you heard about Mule? It was
produced by the process of interspecific
hybridization between a male donkey and
a female horse.

Controlled breeding experiments![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.15.png)
Artificial insemination:
Artificial insemination is a technique in
which the semen collected from the male
is injected to the reproductive tract of the
selected female. Artificial insemination is
economical measure where fewer bulls are
required and maximum use can be made
of the best sire.

### Advantages of artificial insemination
* It increases the rate of conception
* It avoids genital diseases
* Semen can be collected from injured
bulls which have desirable traits.
* Superior animals located apart can be
bred successfully.
Multiple ovulation embryo transfer
technology (MOET)
It is another method of propagation
of animals with desirable traits.
This method is applied when the
success rate of crossing is low even
after artificial insemination. In this
method Follicle stimulating hormone
(FSH) is administered to cows for
inducing follicular maturation and
super ovulation. Instead of one egg
per cycle, 6-8 eggs can be produced by
this technology. The eggs are carefully
recovered non-surgically from the
genetic mother and fertilized artificially.

The embryos at 8-32 celled stages are
recovered and transferred to a surrogate
mother. For another round of ovulation,
the same genetic mother is utilized.
This technology can be applied to cattle,
sheep and buffaloes. Advantage of this
technology is to produce high milk
yielding females and high-quality meat
yielding bulls in a short time.

To meet the milk demand of the
growing population, milk breeds are
preferred by farmers in small scale
farms. Goats are also used all over India
for supplementing deficiencies in milk
production. Some of the breeds of cattle
that are good milkers are Jamunapari in
Ganga-Jamuna riverine tracts, Beetal in
Punjab, Bar–bari in Uttarpradesh.

vitamins and selenium. It also contains
vitamins needed for human diet.
Land management: Grazing of
livestock is sometimes used as a way to
control weeds and undergrowth.
Manure: Manure can be spread on
agriculture fields to increase crop yields.
Poultry Farming
The word poultry refers to the rearing and
propagation of avian species such as chicken,
ducks, turkeys, geese, quail and guinea
fowls. The most common and commercially!
farmed birds are chicken and ducks. Poultry
farming is essential for the purpose of meat,
eggs and feather production. Commercial
poultry farming is also profitable. In this

![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.16.png)

* Game breeds: Since ancient times,
special breed of roosters have been used
for the sport of cockfighting.
Aseel: This breed is white or black in
colour. The hens are not good egg layers but
are good in incubation of eggs. It is found
in all states of India. Aseel is noted for its
pugnacity, high stamina, and majestic gait
and dogged fighting qualities. Although

poor in productivity, this breed is well-
known for their meat qualities.

* Ornamental breeds: Ornamental
chicken are reared as pets in addition to
their use for egg production and meat.
Silkie: It is a breed of chicken has a
typical fluffy plumage, which is said to feel
like silk and satin. The breed has numerous![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.16.png)
additional special characters, such as black
skin and bones, blue earlobes, and five toes
on each foot, while the majority chickens
only have four. They are exhibited in poultry
shows, and come out in various colours.
Silkies are well recognized for their calm,
friendly temperament. Silkie chicken is
especially simple to maintain as pets.
Types of Poultry farming: There are
different methods used to rear both broiler
and layer chicken. The types of poultry
farming are Free range farming, Organic
method, Yarding method, Battery cage
method and Furnished cage method.

Among these, Battery cage method is
widely used in large scale poultry farms. The
Free range, Organic and Yarding methods![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.16.png)
are eco-friendly and the eggs produced by
such farming practices are preferred in the
market.
Stages involved in rearing:
There are some steps involved in rearing of
chicken.
*  Selection of the best layer: An active
intelligent looking bird, with a bright
comb, not obese should be selected.
* Selection of eggs for hatching: Eggs
should be selected very carefully. Eggs
should be fertile, medium sized, dark
brown shelled and freshly laid eggs are
preferred for rearing. Eggs should be
washed, cleaned and dried.
* Incubation and hatching: The
maintenance of newly laid eggs in
optimum condition till hatching is called
incubation. The fully developed chick
emerges out of egg after an incubation
period of 21 – 22 days. There are two
types of incubation namely natural![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.16.png)
incubation and artificial incubation.In
the natural incubation method, only a
limited number of eggs can be incubated
by a mother hen. In artificial incubation,
more number of eggs can be incubated
in a chamber (Incubator).
* Brooding
Caring and management of young chicks for 4
– 6 weeks immediately after hatching is called
brooding. It can also be categorized into two
types namely natural and artificial brooding.
* Housing of Poultry
To protect the poultry from sun, rain
and predators it is necessary to provide
housing to poultry. Poultry house should
be moisture- proof, rat proof and it should
be easily cleanable and durable.
*  Poultry feeding: The diet of chicks
should contain adequate amount of water,
carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and
minerals.
Poultry products: The main products of
poultry farming are eggs and meat. In India,
the primary aim of poultry farming is to
obtain eggs. The eggs and poultry meat are
the richest sources of proteins and vitamins.
Poultry byproducts:
The feathers of poultry birds are used for making![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.16.png)
pillows and quilts. Droppings of poultry can be
used as manure in fields. The droppings are rich
in nitrogen, potash and phosphates.
A number of poultry byproducts like

blood-meal, feather meal, poultry by-
product meal and hatchery by-product meal

are used as good sources of nutrients for
meat producing animals and poultry. These
byproducts supply proteins, fats, vitamins
and good amount of minerals.
Poultry diseases: Ranikhet, Coccidiosis,
and Fowl pox are some common poultry
diseases.![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.16.png)
Benefits of Poultry farming:
The advantages of poultry farming are
* It does not require high capital for
construction and maintenance of the
poultry farming.
* It does not require a big space.

* It ensures high return of investment
within a very short period of time.
*  It provides fresh and nutritious food
and has a huge global demand.![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.16.png)
*  It provides employment opportunities
for the people.
Chickens communicate with more than
24 vocalizations, each with a distinct
meaning, including warning their
friends about different types of predators
or letting their mothers know whether
they’re comfortable
### Duck Farming
Duck is an aquatic bird and forms only 6%
of our country’s poultry population. There
are about 20 breeds of ducks. The native one
includes Indian Runner and Syhlet meta. The
exotic breeds include Muscori, Pekin, Aylesbury
and Campbell. Domesticated ducks have been
derived from the wild duck named Mallard
(Anas boscas). Farming ducks is profitable as it
can be combined with aquafarming practices.
Peculiarity of ducks:
The body is fully covered with oily feathers.
They have a layer of fat under their skin which
prevents it from getting wet. They lay eggs at
night or in the morning. The ducks feed on
rice bran, kitchen wastes, waste fish and snails.
Types of breeds: There are three types of
ducks depending on the purpose for w[](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.15.png)hich
it is formed. They are meat productive duck
breeds, egg productive duck breeds, and
breeds for both meat and egg production.
Advantages of duck farming:
They can be reared in small backyards where
water is available and needs less care and
management as they are very hardy. They can![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.16.png)
adapt themselves to all types of environmental
conditions and are breed for feed efficiency,
growth rate and resistance to diseases.

### Summary
Economic Zoology involves the study
of application of animals for human welfare.
The need of Zoology is to improve our
economic condition, to provide food security
and employment opportunities. Based on
the economic importance, animals can be
categorized as Animals for food and food
products, economically beneficial animals,
Animals of aesthetic importance and Animals
for scientific research. Vermiculture is the
process of using earthworms to decompose
organic food waste, into a nutrient-rich
material capable of supplying necessary
nutrients to sustain plant growth. Sericulture
is the production of silk from the silk worm.
It is an agro-based industry comprising three
main components. They are cultivation of food
plants for the silkworms, rearing of silkworms
and reeling and spinning of silk. Care and
management of honey bees for the production
of honey is called Apiculture. Lac is produced
by the lac insect.
Aquaponics is a combined technique of
aquaculture and hydroponics.It prevents toxic
water runoff and also maintains ecosystem![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.16.png)
deals with the farming of aquatic organisms
such as fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic
plants. On the basis of water resources,
aquaculture can be classified into Freshwater
aquaculture, brackish water aquaculture and
Marine water aquaculture. It includes culture
of fishes, prawn, crab and oyster.
Animal husbandry is the practice of
breeding and raising livestock cattles
like cows, buffaloes, and goats and birds
etc. that are useful to human beings.
Dairying is the production and marketing
of milk and its products. Dairy operation
consists of proper maintenance of cattle,
collection and processing the milk and![](/books/biology/unit-12/trends-in-economic-zoology/12.16.png)
its byproducts. Poultry refers to the
rearing and propagation of avian species
such as chicken, ducks, turkeys, geese,
quail and guinea fowls. The commonly
farmed chicken breeds are categorized into
five based on the purpose for which it is
farmed. They are egg layers, broiler type,
dual type, games and ornamental types.
