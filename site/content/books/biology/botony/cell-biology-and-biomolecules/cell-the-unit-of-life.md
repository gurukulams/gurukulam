and the different concepts associated
with it

and differentiate the cells of animals,
plants, bacteria and viruses

of cell organelles including nucleus

The word ‘cell’ comes from the Latin word
‘Celle” which means ‘a small compartment’.
The word cell was first used by Robert
Hooke (1662) therefore the term ‘cell’ is as
old as 300 years.

#### 6.1. Discovery

**Aristotle**(384-322BC), was the
one who first recognised that
animals and plants consists of organised
structural units but unable to explain what
it was. In 1660’s **Robert Hooke** observed
something which looks like ‘honeycomb with
a great numbers of little boxes’ which was later
called as **‘cell’**from the cork tissue. In 1665,
He compiled his work as **Micrographia**.
Later, **Anton Van Leeuwenhoek** observed
unicellular particles which he named as
**‘animalcules’. Robert Brown** (1831-39)
described the spherical body in plant cell as
nucleus. **H. J. Dutrochet** (1824), a French
scientist, was the first to give an idea on cell
theory. Later, **Matthias Schleiden** (German
Botanist) and **Theodor Schwann** (German
Zoologist) (1833) outlined the basic features
of the cell theory. **Rudolf Virchow**(1858)
explained the cell theory by adding a
feature stating that all living cells arise from
pre-existing living cells by ‘cell division’.
