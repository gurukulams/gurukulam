and the different concepts associated
with it

and differentiate the cells of animals,
plants, bacteria and viruses

of cell organelles including nucleus

The word ‘cell’ comes from the Latin word
‘Celle” which means ‘a small compartment’.
The word cell was first used by Robert
Hooke (1662) therefore the term ‘cell’ is as
old as 300 years.

#### 6.1. Discovery

**Aristotle**(384-322BC), was the
one who first recognised that
animals and plants consists of organised
structural units but unable to explain what
it was. In 1660’s **Robert Hooke** observed
something which looks like ‘honeycomb with
a great numbers of little boxes’ which was later
called as **‘cell’**from the cork tissue. In 1665,
He compiled his work as **Micrographia**.
Later, **Anton Van Leeuwenhoek** observed
unicellular particles which he named as
**‘animalcules’. Robert Brown** (1831-39)
described the spherical body in plant cell as
nucleus. **H. J. Dutrochet** (1824), a French
scientist, was the first to give an idea on cell
theory. Later, **Matthias Schleiden** (German
Botanist) and **Theodor Schwann** (German
Zoologist) (1833) outlined the basic features
of the cell theory. **Rudolf Virchow**(1858)
explained the cell theory by adding a
feature stating that all living cells arise from
pre-existing living cells by ‘cell division’.

#### 6.2. Microscopy

Microscope is an inevitable instrument in
studying the cell and subcellular structures. It
offers scope in studying microscopic organisms
therefore it is named as microscope (mikros –
small; skipein – to see) in Greek terminology.
Compound microscope was invented by
**Z. Jansen.**
Microscope basically works on the
lens system and its properties of light and
lens such as reflection, magnification and
numerical aperture. The common light
microscope which has many lenses are called
as compound microscope. The microscope
transmits visible light from sources to eye or
camera through sample.

#### 6.2.1 Bright field Microscope

Bright field microscope is the routinely used
microscope in studying various aspects of
cells. It allows light to pass directly through
specimen and shows a well distinguished
image from different portions of the
specimen. The contrast can be increased
by staining the specimen with reagent that
reacts with cells and tissue components of
the object.
The light rays are focused by condenser
on to the specimen on a microslide placed
upon the adjustable platform called stage.
Light comes from the Compact Flourescent
Lamp (CFL) or Light Emitting Diode (LED).
Then it passes through two lens systems
namely objective lens (closer to the object)
and the eye piece (closer to eye). There are
four objective lenses (5X, 10X, 45X and
100X) which can be rotated and fixed at
certain point to get required magnification.
It works on the principle of numerical
aperture value and its own resolving power.
The first magnification of the
microscope is done by the objective lens
which is called **primary magnification**
and it is real, inverted image. The second

**Resolution:** The term resolving
power or resolution refers to the
ability of lenses to show the details
of object lying between two points. It
is the finest detail available from an
object. It can be calculated using the
following formula.

Where, λ= wavelength of the light and
NA is the numerical aperture.
Numerical Aperture: It is an important
optical constant associated with the
optical lens denoting the ability to resolve.
Higher the NA value greater will be the
resolving power of the microscope.
Magnification: The optical
increase in size of an image is called
magnification. It is calculated by the
following formula
Magnification =
size of image seen with the microscope
______________________________________
size of the image seen with normal eye

magnification of the microscope is obtained
through eye piece lens called as secondary
magnification and it is virtual and inverted
image (Figure 6.2 a, b and c).

#### 6.2.2 Electron Microscope

Electron Microscope was first introduced
by **Ernest Ruska** (1931) and developed
by **G Binning** and **H Roher** (1981). It is
used to analyse the fine details of cell and
organelles called ultrastructure. It uses
beam of accelerated electrons as source of
illumination and therefore the resolving
power is 1,00,000 times greater than that of
light microscope.
The specimen to be viewed under
electron microscope is dehydrated and
impregnated with electron opaque
chemicals like gold or palladium. This is
essential for withstanding electrons and
also for contrast of the image.

There are two kinds of electron
microscopes namely:
1. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)
2. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)

#### 1. Transmission electron microscope:

This is the most commonly used electron
microscope which provides two dimensional
image. The components of the microscope
are as follows:

a. Electron generating system
b. Electron condensor
c. Specimen objective
d. Tube lens
e. Projector

A beam of electron passes through the
specimen to form an image on fluorescent
screen. The magnification is 1–3 lakhs times
and resolving power is 2–10 Å. It is used
for studying detailed structrue of viruses,

mycoplasma, cellular organelles, etc (Figure
6.3 a and b).

#### 2. Scanning Electron Microscope:
image and has a lower resolving power than
TEM. In this, electrons are focused by means
of lenses into a very fine point. The interaction
of electrons with the specimen results in the
release of different forms of radiation (such
as auger electrons, secondary electrons, back
scattered electrons) from the surface of the
specimen. These radiations are then captured
by an appropriate detector, amplified and
then imaged on fluorescent screen. The
magnification is 2,00,000 times and resolution
is 5–20 nm (Figure 6.4 a and b).

#### 6.3. Cell Theory

In 1833, German botanist **Matthias**
**Schleiden** and German zoologist **Theodor**
**Schwann** proposed that all plants and
animals are composed of cells and that cells
were the basic building blocks of life
