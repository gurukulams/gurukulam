{{<box title = "Learning Objectives">}}

The learner will be able to,

* Outline the cell cycle and different
stages in cell division.

* Recognise the importance of mitosis
in the production of genetically
identical cells.

* Have an insight on the significant
of mitosis and meiosis.

* Familiarize the behaviour of
chromosomes in plants and animal
cells during meiosis.

**Neurons can be replaced!**

Stem cells in the human
brain - most neurons are
in G0 and do not divide. As neurons
and neuroglia die or injured they are
replaced by neural stem cells

#### Chapter Outline

7.1 Nuclear Divisions

7.2 Cell cycle

7.3 Cell Division

7.4 Difference between Mitosis and Meiosis

One of the most important features of the
living cells is their power to grow and divide.

New cells are formed by the division of pre-
existing cells. Cells increase in number by cell

division. The parent cell divides and passes
on genetic material to the daughter cells.


#### 7.1 Nuclear Divisions

There are two types of nuclear division, as
**mitosis** and **meiosis**. In mitosis, the daughter
cells formed will have the same number of
chromosomes as the parent cell, typically

diploid (2n) state. Mitosis is the nuclear
division that occurs when cells grow or when
cells need to be replaced and when organism
reproduces asexually.
In meiosis, the daughter cells contain half
the number of chromosomes of the parent cell
and is known as haploid state (n).
Whichever division takes place, it is
normally followed by division of the cytoplasm
to form separate cells, called as cytokinesis.

**Edouard Van Beneden,**
a Belgian cytologist,
embryologist and marine
biologist. He was Professor
of Zoology at the University of Liège.
He contributed to cytogenetics by his
works on the roundworm Ascaris. In his
work he discovered how chromosomes
organized meiosis (the production of
gametes).

#### 7.2 Cell Cycle

Definition: A series of events leading to the
formation of new cell is known as cell cycle.
The series of events include several phases.

#### 7.2.1 Duration of Cell Cycle

Different kinds of cells have varied duration
for cell cycle phases. Eukaryotic cell divides
every 24 hours. The cell cycle is divided into
mitosis and interphase. In a cell cycle 95%
is spent for interphase whereas the mitosis
and cytokinesis last only for an hour.

The different phases of cell cycle are as
follows (Figure 7.1).

#### 7.2.2 Interphase

Longest part of the cell cycle, but it is of
extremely variable length. At first glance the
nucleus appears to be resting but this is not

the case at all. The chromosomes previously
visible as thread like structure, have dispersed.
Now they are actively involved in protein
synthesis, at least for most of the interphase.

C-Value is the amount in picograms of
DNA contained within a haploid nucleus.

#### 7.2.3 G<sub>1</sub> Phase

The first gap phase – 2C amount of DNA
in cells of G<sub>1</sub>. Cells become metabolically
active and grows by producing proteins,
lipids, carbohydrates and cell organelles
including mitochondria and endoplasmic
reticulum. Many checkpoints control the
cell cycle. The check point are also called
as the restriction point. First check point
at the end of G1, determines a cells fate
whether it will continue in the cell cycle and
divide or enter a stage called G0 a quiescent
stage, probably as specified cell or die. Cells
are arrested in G<sub>1</sub> due to:

• Nutrient deprivation

• Lack of growth factors or density
dependant inhibition

• Undergo metabolic changes and enter
into G0 state.

Biochemicals inside cell 
activates the cell division. 


The proteins called kinases
and cyclins activate genes and their proteins
to perform cell division. Cyclins act as
major checkpoint which operates in G1 to
determine whether or not a cell divides.

**Dolly**
Since the DNA of cells
in G0, do not replicate.
Researchers are able
to fuse the donor cells
from a sheep’s mammary glands into
G0 state by culturing in the nutrient
free state. The G0 donor nucleus
synchronised with cytoplasm of the
recipient egg, which developed into
the clone Dolly.

#### 7.2.4 G<sub>0</sub>Phase

Some cells exit G1 and enters a quiescent
stage called G0, where the cell remains
metabolically active without proliferation.
Cells can exist for long periods in G0 phase.
In G0, cells cease growth with reduced rate of
RNA and protein synthesis. The G0 phase is
not permanent. Mature neuron and skeletal
muscle cell remain permanently in G0. Many
cells in animals remains in G0 unless called
on to proliferate by appropriate growth
factors or other extracellular signals. G0 cells
are not dormant.

#### 7.2.5 S phase – Synthesis phase – cells with intermediate amounts of DNA.

Growth of the cell continues as replication of
DNA occur, protein molecules called **histones**
are synthesised and attach to the DNA. The
centrioles duplicate in the cytoplasm. DNA
content increases from 2C to 4C.

#### 7.2.6 G<sub>2</sub> – The second Gap phase – 4C amount of DNA in cells of G<sub>2</sub> and mitosis

Cell growth continues by protein and cell
organelle synthesis, mitochondria and
chloroplasts divide. DNA content remains as
4C. Tubulin is synthesised and microtubules
are formed. Microtubles organise to form
spindle fibre. The spindle begins to form
and nuclear division follows.

One of the proteins synthesized only
in the G2 period is known as **Maturation**
**Promoting Factor (MPF).** It brings about
condensation of interphase chromosomes
into the mitotic form.
DNA damage checkpoints operates in G1
S and G2 phases of the cell cycle.

### 7.3 Cell Division

#### 7.3.1 Amitosis (Direct Cell Division)

Amitosis is also called **direct or incipient cell**
division. Here there is no spindle formation
and chromatin material does not condense.
It consist of two steps: (Figure 7.2).
