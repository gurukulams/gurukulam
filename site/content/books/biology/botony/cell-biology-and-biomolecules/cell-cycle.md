7.3 Cell Division

7.4 Difference between Mitosis and Meiosis

One of the most important features of the
living cells is their power to grow and divide.

New cells are formed by the division of pre-
existing cells. Cells increase in number by cell

division. The parent cell divides and passes
on genetic material to the daughter cells.


#### 7.1 Nuclear Divisions

There are two types of nuclear division, as
**mitosis** and **meiosis**. In mitosis, the daughter
cells formed will have the same number of
chromosomes as the parent cell, typically

diploid (2n) state. Mitosis is the nuclear
division that occurs when cells grow or when
cells need to be replaced and when organism
reproduces asexually.
In meiosis, the daughter cells contain half
the number of chromosomes of the parent cell
and is known as haploid state (n).
Whichever division takes place, it is
normally followed by division of the cytoplasm
to form separate cells, called as cytokinesis.

a Belgian cytologist,
embryologist and marine
biologist. He was Professor
of Zoology at the University of Liège.
He contributed to cytogenetics by his
works on the roundworm Ascaris. In his
work he discovered how chromosomes
organized meiosis (the production of
gametes).

#### 7.2 Cell Cycle

Definition: A series of events leading to the
formation of new cell is known as cell cycle.
The series of events include several phases.

![](/books/botany/cellcycle/table1.png)

#### 7.2.1 Duration of Cell Cycle

Different kinds of cells have varied duration
for cell cycle phases. Eukaryotic cell divides
every 24 hours. The cell cycle is divided into
mitosis and interphase. In a cell cycle 95%
is spent for interphase whereas the mitosis
and cytokinesis last only for an hour.

![](/books/botany/cellcycle/table2.png)

The different phases of cell cycle are as
follows (Figure 7.1).

#### 7.2.2 Interphase

Longest part of the cell cycle, but it is of
extremely variable length. At first glance the
nucleus appears to be resting but this is not


![](/books/botany/cellcycle/table2.png)

the case at all. The chromosomes previously
visible as thread like structure, have dispersed.
Now they are actively involved in protein
synthesis, at least for most of the interphase.

![cell-cycle](/books/biology/unit-3/cellcycle/Fig7.1.eng.png )

C-Value is the amount in picograms of
DNA contained within a haploid nucleus.

#### 7.2.3 G<sub>1</sub> Phase

The first gap phase – 2C amount of DNA
in cells of G<sub>1</sub>. Cells become metabolically
active and grows by producing proteins,
lipids, carbohydrates and cell organelles
including mitochondria and endoplasmic
reticulum. Many checkpoints control the
cell cycle. The check point are also called
as the restriction point. First check point
at the end of G1, determines a cells fate
whether it will continue in the cell cycle and
divide or enter a stage called G0 a quiescent
stage, probably as specified cell or die. Cells
are arrested in G<sub>1</sub> due to:

• Nutrient deprivation

• Lack of growth factors or density
dependant inhibition

• Undergo metabolic changes and enter
into G0 state.

Biochemicals inside cell 
activates the cell division. 


The proteins called kinases
and cyclins activate genes and their proteins
to perform cell division. Cyclins act as
major checkpoint which operates in G1 to
determine whether or not a cell divides.


{{< box= "Do You Know.. Why??" >}}


**Dolly**
Since the DNA of cells
in G0, do not replicate.
Researchers are able
to fuse the donor cells
from a sheep’s mammary glands into
G0 state by culturing in the nutrient
free state. The G0 donor nucleus
synchronised with cytoplasm of the
recipient egg, which developed into
the clone Dolly.

{{< /box >}}

#### 7.2.4 G<sub>0</sub>Phase

Some cells exit G1 and enters a quiescent
stage called G0, where the cell remains
metabolically active without proliferation.
Cells can exist for long periods in G0 phase.
In G0, cells cease growth with reduced rate of
RNA and protein synthesis. The G0 phase is
not permanent. Mature neuron and skeletal
muscle cell remain permanently in G0. Many
cells in animals remains in G0 unless called
on to proliferate by appropriate growth
factors or other extracellular signals. G0 cells
are not dormant.

#### 7.2.5 S phase – Synthesis phase – cells with intermediate amounts of DNA.

Growth of the cell continues as replication of
DNA occur, protein molecules called **histones**
are synthesised and attach to the DNA. The
centrioles duplicate in the cytoplasm. DNA
content increases from 2C to 4C.

#### 7.2.6 G<sub>2</sub> – The second Gap phase – 4C amount of DNA in cells of G<sub>2</sub> and mitosis

Cell growth continues by protein and cell
organelle synthesis, mitochondria and
chloroplasts divide. DNA content remains as
4C. Tubulin is synthesised and microtubules
are formed. Microtubles organise to form
spindle fibre. The spindle begins to form
and nuclear division follows.

One of the proteins synthesized only
in the G2 period is known as **Maturation**
**Promoting Factor (MPF).** It brings about
condensation of interphase chromosomes
into the mitotic form.
DNA damage checkpoints operates in G1
S and G2 phases of the cell cycle.

### 7.3 Cell Division

#### 7.3.1 Amitosis (Direct Cell Division)

Amitosis is also called **direct or incipient cell**
division. Here there is no spindle formation
and chromatin material does not condense.
It consist of two steps: (Figure 7.2).

![cell-cycle](/books/biology/unit-3/cellcycle/Fig7.2.eng.png )

**Karyokinesis:**

* Involves division of
nucleus.

*  Nucleus develops a
constriction at the
center and becomes
dumbell shaped.

* Constriction deepens and divides the
nucleus into two.

**Cytokinesis:**

* Involves division of cytoplasm.

* Plasma membrane develops a
constriction along nuclear constriction.

* It deepens centripetally and finally
divides the cell into two cells.
Example: Cells of mammalian cartilage,
macronucleus of Paramecium and old
degenerating cells of higher plants.

**Drawbacks of Amitosis**

* Causes unequal distribution of
chromosomes.

* Can lead to abnormalities in metabolism
and reproduction.

#### 7.3.2 Mitosis

Mitosis occurs in shoot and root tips and
other meristematic tissues of plants associated
with growth. The number of chromosomes
in the parent and the daughter (Progeny)
cells remain the same so it is also called as
**equational division.**

#### 7.3.3 Closed and Open Mitosis

In closed mitosis, the nuclear envelope
remains intact and chromosomes migrate
to opposite poles of a spindle within the
nucleus (Figure 7.3).

Example: Many single celled eukaryotes
including yeast and slime molds.

In open mitosis, the nuclear envelope
breaks down and then reforms around the 2
sets of separated chromosome.

Example: Most plants and animals

**Some animals are able to regenerate**
**whole parts of the body.**



![cell-cycle](/books/biology/unit-3/cellcycle/Fig7.3.eng.png )

Mitosis is divided into four stages
prophase, metaphase, anaphase and
telophase (Figure 7.6).

**Prophase**

Prophase is the longest phase in mitosis.
Chromosomes become visible as long
thin thread like structure, condenses to
form compact mitotic chromosomes.
In plant cells initiation of spindle fibres
takes place, nucleolus disappears. Nuclear
envelope breaks down. Golgi apparatus and
endoplasmic reticulum disappear.

![cell-cycle](/books/biology/unit-3/cellcycle/Fig7.4.eng.png )

In animal cell the centrioles extend a
radial array of microtubules (Figure 7.4) and
reach the poles of the cell. This arrangement
of microtubules is called **an aster**. Plant cells
do not form asters.

**Metaphase**

Chromosomes (two sister chromatids) are
attached to the spindle fibres by kinetochore
of the centromere. The spindle fibres are made
up of tubulin. The alignment of chromosome
into compact group at the equator of the cell
is known as **metaphase plate**. This is the
stage where the chromosomal morphology
can be easily studied.

Kinetochore is a DNA–Protein complex
present at the centromere where microtubules
are attached. It is a trilaminar disc like plate.


![cell-cycle](/books/biology/unit-3/cellcycle/Fig7.5.eng.png )

**Anaphase**

Each chromosome splits simultaneously and two
daughter chromatids begin to migrate towards
two opposite poles of a cell. Each centromere
splits longitudinally into two, freeing the two
sister chromatids from each other. When sister
chromatids separate the actual partitioning of
the replicated genome is complete.

APC (Anaphase Promoting Complex) is
a cluster of proteins that induces the breaking
down of cohesion proteins which leads to
the separation of chromatids during mitosis
(Figure 7.5). Thus it helps in the transition of
metaphase to anaphase.

**Telophase**

Two sets of daughter
chromosomes reach opposite
poles of the cell and mitotic
spindle disappears. Division of
genetic material is completed
during karyokinesis, followed
by cytokinesis (division of
cytoplasm). Nucleolus and
nuclear membranes reforms.
Nuclear membrane form around
each set of **chromosomes**.
Now the chromosomes
decondense. In plants, phragmoplast are
formed between the daughter cells. Cell
plate is formed between the two daughter
cells, reconstruction of cell wall takes place.
Finally cells are separated by the distribution
of organelles, macromolecules into two
newly formed daughter cells.


#### 7.3.4 Cytokinesis

**Cytokinesis in Animal Cells**

It is a contractile process. The ring consists of
a bundle of microfilaments assembled from
**actin and myosin**. This fibril generates a
contractile force, that draws the ring inward
forming a cleavage furrow in the cell. Thus it
divides the cell into two.

**Check your grasp!**
What effect does mitosis have on
transcription?
During mitosis transcription stops.


**Cytokinesis in Plant Cell**

Division of the cytoplasm often starts during
telophase. In plants, cell plate grows from
centre towards lateral walls.

Phragmoplast contains microtubules, actin
filaments and vesicles from golgi apparatus
and ER. Microtubule of the pharagmoplast
move to the equator, fuse to form a new plasma
membrane and the materials which are placed


![cell-cycle](/books/biology/unit-3/cellcycle/Fig7.6.eng.png )

there becomes new cell wall. The first stage
of cell wall construction is a line dividing the
newly forming cells called a **cell plate**. The cell
plate eventually stretches right across the cell
forming the middle lamella. Cellulose builds
up on each side of the middle lamella to form
the cell walls of two new plant cells.

A Culture of animal cells in which the cell
cycles were asynchronous was incubated
with 3H-Thymidine for 10 minutes.
Autoradiography showed that 50% of the
cells were labelled. If the cell cycle time
(generation time) was 16 hrs how long
was the S period?
Length of the S period = Fraction of
cells in DNA replication × generation time
Length of the S period = 0.5 × 16
hours = 8 hours

#### 7.3.5 Significance of Mitosis

Exact copy of the parent cell is produced by
mitosis (genetically identical).

1. Genetic stability – daughter cells are
genetically identical to parent cells.

2. Growth – as multicellular organisms
grow, the number of cells making up
their tissue increases. The new cells must
be identical to the existing ones.

3. Repair of tissues - damaged cells must be
replaced by identical new cells by mitosis.

4. Asexual reproduction – asexual reproduction
results in offspring that are identical to the
parent. Example Yeast and Amoeba.

5. In flowering plants, structure such
as bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes
and runners are produced by mitotic
division. When they separate from the
parent, they form a new individual.
The production of large numbers of
offsprings in a short period of time,
is possible only by mitosis. In genetic
engineering and biotechnology, tissues
are grown by mitosis (i.e. in tissue culture).

6. Regeneration – Arms of star fish.

#### 7.3.6 Meiosis

In Greek meioum means to reduce. Meiosis
is unique because of synapsis, homologous
recombination and reduction division.

Meiosis takes place in the reproductive
organs. It results in the formation of gametes
with half the normal chromosome number.

Haploid sperms are made in testes;
haploid eggs are made in ovaries of animals.
In flowering plants meiosis occurs
during microsporogenesis in anthers and
megasporogenesis in ovule. In contrast to
mitosis, meiosis produces cells that are not
genetically identical. So meiosis has a key
role in producing new genetic types which
results in genetic variation.

#### Stages in Meiosis

Meiosis can be studied under two divisions
i.e., meiosis I and meiosis II. As with mitosis,
the cell is said to be in interphase when it is
not dividing.


{{< box >}}

Prophase I is the longest and most complex
stage in meiosis. Pairing of homologous
chromosomes (bivalents) take place.

#### Meiosis I-Reduction Division

**Prophase I** – Prophase I is of longer
duration and it is divided into 5 substages –
Leptotene, Zygotene, Pachytene, Diplotene
and Diakinesis (Figure 7.7).
