# Lessons coming soon!

{{<box title = "Learning Objectives">}}

The learner will be able to,

* Outline the cell cycle and different
stages in cell division.

* Recognise the importance of mitosis
in the production of genetically
identical cells.

* Have an insight on the significant
of mitosis and meiosis.

* Familiarize the behaviour of
chromosomes in plants and animal
cells during meiosis.

**Neurons can be replaced!**

Stem cells in the human
brain - most neurons are
in G0 and do not divide. As neurons
and neuroglia die or injured they are
replaced by neural stem cells

7.1 Nuclear Divisions

7.2 Cell cycle

7.3 Cell Division

7.4 Difference between Mitosis and Meiosis

One of the most important features of the
living cells is their power to grow and divide.

New cells are formed by the division of pre-
existing cells. Cells increase in number by cell

division. The parent cell divides and passes
on genetic material to the daughter cells.


#### 7.1 Nuclear Divisions

There are two types of nuclear division, as
**mitosis** and **meiosis**. In mitosis, the daughter
cells formed will have the same number of
chromosomes as the parent cell, typically

diploid (2n) state. Mitosis is the nuclear
division that occurs when cells grow or when
cells need to be replaced and when organism
reproduces asexually.
In meiosis, the daughter cells contain half
the number of chromosomes of the parent cell
and is known as haploid state (n).
Whichever division takes place, it is
normally followed by division of the cytoplasm
to form separate cells, called as cytokinesis.

**Edouard Van Beneden,**
a Belgian cytologist,
embryologist and marine
biologist. He was Professor
of Zoology at the University of Li√®ge.
He contributed to cytogenetics by his
works on the roundworm Ascaris. In his
work he discovered how chromosomes
organized meiosis (the production of
gametes).

#### 7.2 Cell Cycle

Definition: A series of events leading to the
formation of new cell is known as cell cycle.
The series of events include several phases.

#### 7.2.1 Duration of Cell Cycle

Different kinds of cells have varied duration
for cell cycle phases. Eukaryotic cell divides
every 24 hours. The cell cycle is divided into
mitosis and interphase. In a cell cycle 95%
is spent for interphase whereas the mitosis
and cytokinesis last only for an hour.



#### 7.2.2 Interphase

Longest part of the cell cycle, but it is of
extremely variable length. At first glance the
nucleus appears to be resting but this is not
