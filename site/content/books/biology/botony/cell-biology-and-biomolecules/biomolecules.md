6.5. Plant and Animal cell

6.6. Cell organelles

6.7. Nucleus

6.8. Flagella

The word ‘cell’ comes from the Latin word
‘Celle” which means ‘a small compartment’.
The word cell was first used by Robert
Hooke (1662) therefore the term ‘cell’ is as
old as 300 years.

##### 6.1. Discovery

**Aristotle** (384-322BC), was the
one who first recognised that
animals and plants consists of organised
structural units but unable to explain what
it was. In 1660’s Robert Hooke observed
something which looks like ‘honeycomb with
a great numbers of little boxes’ which was later
called as ‘cell’ from the cork tissue. In 1665,
He compiled his work as Micrographia.
Later, Anton Van Leeuwenhoek observed
unicellular particles which he named as
‘animalcules’. Robert Brown (1831-39)
described the spherical body in plant cell as
nucleus. H. J. Dutrochet (1824), a French
scientist, was the first to give an idea on cell
theory. Later, Matthias Schleiden (German
Botanist) and Theodor Schwann (German
Zoologist) (1833) outlined the basic features
of the cell theory. Rudolf Virchow (1858)
explained the cell theory by adding a
feature stating that all living cells arise from
pre-existing living cells by ‘cell division’.

#### 6.2. Microscopy

 Microscope is an inevitable instrument in
studying the cell and subcellular structures. It
offers scope in studying microscopic organisms
therefore it is named as microscope (mikros –
small; skipein – to see) in Greek terminology.
Compound microscope was invented by
**Z.Jansen.**

Microscope basically works on the
lens system and its properties of light and
lens such as reflection, magnification and
numerical aperture. The common light
microscope which has many lenses are called
as compound microscope. The microscope
transmits visible light from sources to eye or
camera through sample.

#### 6.2.1 Bright field Microscope

Bright field microscope is the routinely used
microscope in studying various aspects of
cells. It allows light to pass directly through
specimen and shows a well distinguished
image from different portions of the
specimen. The contrast can be increased
by staining the specimen with reagent that
reacts with cells and tissue components of
the object.

The light rays are focused by condenser
on to the specimen on a microslide placed
upon the adjustable platform called stage.
Light comes from the Compact Flourescent
Lamp (CFL) or Light Emitting Diode (LED).
Then it passes through two lens systems
namely objective lens (closer to the object)
and the eye piece (closer to eye). There are
four objective lenses (5X, 10X, 45X and
100X) which can be rotated and fixed at
certain point to get required magnification.
It works on the principle of numerical
aperture value and its own resolving power.
The first magnification of the
microscope is done by the objective lens
which is called primary magnification
and it is real, inverted image. The second

Resolution: The term resolving
power or resolution refers to the
ability of lenses to show the details
of object lying between two points. It
is the finest detail available from an
object. It can be calculated using the
following formula.

{{<box title = "Learning Objectives">}}

Where, λ= wavelength of the light and
NA is the numerical aperture.
Numerical Aperture: It is an important
optical constant associated with the
optical lens denoting the ability to resolve.
Higher the NA value greater will be the
resolving power of the microscope.
Magnification: The optical
increase in size of an image is called
magnification. It is calculated by the
size of image seen with the microscope
size of the image seen with normal eye

{{</box>}}


magnification of the microscope is obtained
through eye piece lens called as secondary
magnification and it is virtual and inverted
image (Figure 6.2 a, b and c).

##### 6.2.2 Electron Microscope

Electron Microscope was first introduced
by Ernest Ruska (1931) and developed
by G Binning and H Roher (1981). It is
used to analyse the fine details of cell and
organelles called ultrastructure. It uses
beam of accelerated electrons as source of
illumination and therefore the resolving
power is 1,00,000 times greater than that of
light microscope.

The specimen to be viewed under
electron microscope is dehydrated and
impregnated with electron opaque
chemicals like gold or palladium. This is
essential for withstanding electrons and
also for contrast of the image.


![](/books/botany/pic2.png)

There are two kinds of electron
microscopes namely:
1. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)
2. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
1. Transmission electron microscope:
This is the most commonly used electron
microscope which provides two dimensional
image. The components of the microscope
are as follows
a. Electron generating system
b. Electron condensor
c. Specimen objective
d. Tube lens
e. Projector

A beam of electron passes through the
specimen to form an image on fluorescent
screen. The magnification is 1–3 lakhs times
and resolving power is 2–10 Å. It is used
for studying detailed structrue of viruses,

![](/books/botany/pic3.png)

![](/books/botany/pic4.png)



mycoplasma, cellular organelles, etc (Figure
6.3 a and b).

#### 2. Scanning Electron Microscope:

This is used to obtain three dimensional
image and has a lower resolving power than
TEM. In this, electrons are focused by means
of lenses into a very fine point. The interaction
of electrons with the specimen results in the
release of different forms of radiation (such
as auger electrons, secondary electrons, back
scattered electrons) from the surface of the
specimen. These radiations are then captured
by an appropriate detector, amplified and
then imaged on fluorescent screen. The
magnification is 2,00,000 times and resolution
is 5–20 nm (Figure 6.4 a and b).

#### 6.3. Cell Theory

In 1833, German botanist Matthias
Schleiden and German zoologist Theodor
Schwann proposed that all plants and
animals are composed of cells and that cells
were the basic building blocks of life.

• All organisms are made up of cells.
• New cells are formed by the division of
pre-existing cells.
• Cells contains genetic material, which is
passed on from parents to daughter cells.
• All metabolic reactions take place
inside the cells.

#### 6.3.1 Exception to Cell Theory

Viruses are puzzle in biology. Viruses,
viroids and prions are the exception to cell
theory. They lack protoplasm, the essential
part of the cell and exists as obligate parasites
which are sub-cellular in nature.

#### 6.3.2 Protoplasm Theory
Corti first observed protoplasm. Felix
Dujardin (1835) observed a living juice in
animal cell and called it “Sarcode”. Purkinje
(1839) coined the term protoplasm for sap
inside a plant cell. Hugo Van Mohl (1846)
indicated importance of protoplasm.


{{<box title = "Learning Objectives">}}


Microscopic measurements:
The microscope also has facility
to measure microscopic objects
through a technique called
‘micrometry’. There are two scales
involved for measuring.
1. Ocular Micrometre
2. Stage Micrometre
Ocular Micrometre: It is fixed inside the eye piece lens.
It is a thin transparent glass disc where there are lines
divided into 100 equal units. The scale has no value.
Stage Micrometre:This is a slide with a line divided
into 100 units. The line is about 10mm. The distance
between two adjacent lines is 10 μm. The known
value of the stage micrometre is transferred to the ocular micrometre, thereby the
measurement can be made using ocular micrometre.
The distance between two adjacent line of ocular meter= Number of stage divisions
Number of ocular divisions

**MaxSchultze** (1861) established
similarity between Protoplasm and Sarcode
and proposed a theory which later on called
“Protoplasm Theory” by O. Hertwig
(1892). Huxley (1868) proposed Protoplasm
as a “physical basis of life”.

 **Protoplasm as a Colloidal System**

Protoplasm is a complex colloidal system which
was suggested by Fisher in 1894 and Hardy in
1899. It is primarily made of water and various
other solutes of biological importance such
as glucose, fatty acids, amino acids, minerals,
vitamins, hormones and enzymes.
These solutes may be homogeneous
(soluble in water) or heterogeneous mass
(insoluble in water) which forms the basis
for its colloidal nature.

**Physical Properties of Protoplasm**
The protoplasm exists either in semisolid
(jelly-like) state called ‘gel ̓ due to suspended
particles and various chemical bonds or
may be liquid state called ‘sol ̓.The colloidal

protoplasm which is in gel form can change
into sol form by solation and the sol can
change into gel by gelation. These gel-sol
conditions of colloidal system are prime basis
for mechanical behaviour of cytoplasm.


1. Protoplasm is translucent, odourless and
polyphasic fluid.

2. It is a crystal colloid solution which is a
mixture of chemical substances forming
crystalloid i.e. true solution (sugars, salts,
acids, bases) and others forming colloidal
solution (Proteins and lipids)

3. It is the most important property of the
protoplasm by which it exhibits three main
phenomena namely Brownian movement,
amoeboid movement and cytoplasmic
streaming or cyclosis. Viscosity of
protoplasm is 2–20 centipoises. The
Refractive index of the protoplasm is 1.4.

4. The pH of the protoplasm is around 6.8,
contain 90% water (10% in dormant seeds)
5. Approximately 34 elements are present
in protoplasm but only 13 elements are
main or universal elements i.e. C, H, O, N,
Cl, Ca, P, Na, K, S, Mg, I and Fe. Carbon,
Hydrogen, Oxygen and Nitrogen form the
96% of protoplasm.

6. Protoplasm is neither a good nor a
bad conductor of electricity. It forms a
delimiting membrane in contact with
water and solidifies when heated.
7. Cohesiveness: Particles or molecules of
protoplasm are adhered with each other by
forces, such as Van der Waal’s bonds, that
hold long chains of molecules together.
This property varies with the strength of
these forces.

8. Contractility: The contractility of proto-
plasm is important for the absorption and

removal of water especially for stomatal
operations.
9. Surface tension: The proteins and lipids of
the protoplasm have less surface tension,
hence they are found at the surface forming
the membrane. On the other hand the
chemical substances (NaCl) have high
surface tension, so they occur in deeper
parts of the protoplasm.


**6.3.3 Cell sizes and shapes**
Cell greatly vary in size, shape and also in
function. Group of cells with similar structures
are called tissue they integrate together to
perform similar function, group of tissue
join together to perform similar function
called organ, group of organs with related
function called organ system, organ system
coordinating together to form an organism.
Shape

The shape of cell vary greatly from organism
to organism and within the organism itself. In
bacteria, cell shape vary from round (cocci)
to rectangular (rod). In virus, shape of the
envelope varies from round to hexagonal or
‘T’ shaped. In fungi, globular to elongated
cylindrical cells and the spores of fungi vary

![](/books/botany/pic6.png)

![](/books/botany/pic7.png)

greatly in shape. In plants and animals cells
vary in shape according to cell types such as
parenchyma, mesophyll, palisade, tracheid,
fiber, epithelium and others (Figure 6.6).

**6.4. Types of cells**

On the basis of the cellular organization and
the nuclear characteristics, the cell can be
classified into
• Prokaryotes
• Mesokaryotes and
• Eukaryotes

**6.4.1 Prokaryotes**

Those organisms with primitive nucleus are
called as prokaryotes (pro – primitive; karyon
– nucleus). The DNA lies in the ‘nucleoid’
which is not bound by the nuclear membrane
and therefore it is not a true nucleus and is
also a primitive type of nuclear material. The
DNA is without histone proteins. Example:
Bacteria, blue green algae, Mycoplasma,
Rickettsiae and Spirochaetae.

**6.4.2 Mesokaryotes**
In the year 1966, scientist Dodge and his
coworkers proposed another kind of organisms
called mesokaryotes. These organisms
which shares some of the characters of both
prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In other words
these are organisms intermediate between
pro and eukaryotes. These contains well
organized nucleus with nuclear membrane
and the DNA is organized into chromosomes
but without histone protein components
divides through amitosis similar with
prokaryotes. Certain Protozoa like
Noctiluca, some phytoplanktons like
Gymnodinium, Peridinium and Dinoflagellates
are representatives of mesokaryotes.

**6.4.3 Eukaryotes**

Those organisms which have true nucleus
are called Eukaryotes (Eu – True; karyon –
nucleus). The DNA is associated with histones
forming the chromosomes. Membrane bound
organelles are present. Few organelles may
have risen by endosymbiosis which is a cell
living inside another cell. The Organelles like
mitochondria and chloroplast well support
this theory.

**Origin of Eukaryotic cell:**

Endosymbiont theory: Two eukaryotic
organelles believed to be the descendants
of the endosymbiotic prokaryotes. The
ancestors of the eukaryotic cell engulfed
a bacterium and the bacteria continued
to function inside the host cell.

**Comparison between types of cellular organisation**

#### 6.5. Plant and Animal cell

**6.5.1 Ultra Structure of an Eukaryotic Cell**
An eukaryotic cell is highly distinct in its
organisation. It shows several variations in
different organisms. For instance, eukaryotic cells
in plants and animals vary greatly (Figure 6.7).

![](/books/botany/pic9.png)

**Animal Cell**
Animal cells are surrounded by cell membrane
or plasma membrane. Inside this membrane
a gelatinous matrix called protoplasm is
seen to contain nucleus and other organelles
which include the endoplasmic reticulum,
mitochondria, golgi bodies, centrioles,
lysosomes, ribosomes and cytoskeleton.

**Plant cell**
A typical plant cell has prominent
cell wall, a large central vacuole and plastids
in addition to other organelles present in
animal cell (Figure 6.8).

![](/books/botany/pic10.png)

**6.5.2 Protoplasm**
Protoplasm is the living content of cell that
is surrounded by plasma membrane. It is a
colourless material that exists throughout
the cell together with cytoplasm, nucleus and
other organelles. Protoplasm is composed
of a mixture of small particles, such as

![](/books/botany/pic11.png)


ions, amino acids, monosaccharides, water,
macromolecules like nucleic acids, proteins,
lipids and polysaccharides. It appears
colourless, jelly like gelatinous, viscous
elastic and granular. It appears foamy due
to the presence of large number of vacuoles.
It responds to the stimuli like heat, electric
shock, chemicals and so on.

![](/books/botany/pic12.png)

**6.5.3 Cell Wall**

Cell wall is the outermost protective cover
of the cell. It is present in bacteria, fungi
and plants whereas it is absent in animal
cell. It was first observed by **Robert Hooke**.
It is an actively growing portion. It is made
up of different complex material in various
organism. In bacteria it is composed of
peptidoglycan, in fungi chitin and fungal
cellulose, in algae cellulose, galactans and
mannans. In plants it is made up of cellulose,
hemicellulose, pectin, lignin, cutin, suberin
and silica.

In plant, cell wall shows three distinct
regions (a) Primary wall (b) Secondary wall
(c) Middle lamellae (Figure 6.10).

**a. Primary wall**

It is the first layer inner to middle lamella,
primarily consisting of loose network of
cellulose microfibrils in a gel matrix. It is
thin, elastic and extensible.In most plants the
microfibrils are made up of cellulose oriented
differently based on shape and thickness
of the wall. The matrix of the primary
wall is composed of hemicellulose, pectin,
glycoprotein and water. Hemicellulose binds
the microfibrils with matrix and glycoproteins
control the orientation of microfibrils while
pectin serves as filling material of the matrix.
Cells such as parenchyma and meristems
have only primary wall.

**b. Secondary wall**

Secondary wall is laid during maturation of
the cell. It plays a key role in determining the
shape of a cell. It is thick, inelastic and is made
up of cellulose and lignin. The secondary
wall is divided into three sublayers termed as
S1, S2 and S3 where the cellulose microfibrils
are compactly arranged with different
orientation forming a laminated structure
and the cell wall strength is increased.

**c. Middle lamellae**
It is the outermost layer made up of calcium
and magnesium pectate, deposited at the
time of cytokinesis. It is a thin amorphous
layer which cements two adjacent cells. It is
optically inactive (isotropic).

**Plasmodesmata and Pits**

Plasmodesmata act as a channel between the
protoplasm of adjacent cells through which
many substances pass through. Moreover,
at few regions, the secondary wall layer is
laid unevenly whereas the primary wall and
middle lamellae are laid continuously such
regions are called pits. The Pits of adjacent
cells are opposite to each other. Each pit has
a pit chamber and a pit membrane. The pit
membrane has many minute pores and thus
they are permeable. The pits are of two types
namely simple and bordered pit.


![](/books/botany/pic13.png)

**Functions of cell wall**

The cell wall plays a vital role in holding
several important functions given below

1. Offers definite shape and rigidity to the
cell.

2. Serves as barrier for several molecules to
enter the cells.

3. Provides protection to the internal
protoplasm against mechanical injury.

4. Prevents the bursting of cells by
maintaining the osmotic pressure.

5. Plays a major role by acting as a
mechanism of defense for the cells.

**6.5.4 Cell Membrane**

The cell membrane is also called cell surface
(or) plasma membrane. It is a thin structure
which holds the cytoplasmic content called
‘cytosol’. It is extremely thin (less than 10nm).


![](/books/botany/pic14.png)

**Fluid Mosaic Model**

**Jonathan Singer**and Garth Nicolson
(1972) proposed fluid mosaic model.
It is made up of lipids and proteins
together with a little amount of carbohydrate.
The lipid membrane is made up of
phospholipid. The phospholipid molecule
has a hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic
head. The hydrophobic tail repels water and
hydrophilic head attracts water. The proteins
of the membrane are globular proteins which
are found intermingled between the lipid
bilayer most of which are projecting beyond
the lipid bilayer. These proteins are called
as integral proteins. Few are superficially
attached on either surface of the lipid bilayer
which are called as peripheral proteins.
The proteins are involved in transport of
molecules across the membranes and also
act as enzymes, receptors (or) antigens.


{{<box title = "Learning Objectives">}}

enzymes, receptors (or) antigens.
Water-loving polar
molecule are called
hydrophilic molecule.
They have polar
phosphate group responsible for
attracting water.
Water hating non-polar molecule are
called as hydrophobic molecule. They
have fatty acid which is non-polar which
cannot attract water


{{< /box >}}

Carbohydrate molecules of cell membrane
are short chain polysaccharides. These are either
bound with ‘**glycoproteins**’ or ‘**glycolipids**’
and form a ‘**glyocalyx**’ (Figure 6.11).
The movement of membrane lipids from one
side of the membrane to the other side by
vertical movement is called **flip flopping** or
**flip flop movement**. This movement takes
place more slowly than lateral diffusion of
lipid molecule. The Phospholipids can have
flip flop movement because they have smaller
polar regions, whereas the proteins cannot flip
flop because the polar region is extensive.


**Function of Cell Membrane**
The functions of the cell membrane is
enormous which includes cell signalling,
transporting nutrients and water, preventing
unwanted substances entering into the cell,
and so on.


**Cytoplasm**

Cytoplasm is the main arena of various activities
of a cell. It is the semifluid gelatinous substance
that fills the cell. It is made up of eighty percent
water and is usually clear and colourless. The
cytoplasm is sometimes described as non
nuclear content of protoplasm. The cytoplasm
serves as a molecular soup where all the
cellular organelles are suspended and bound
together by a lipid bilayer plasma membrane. It
constitutes dissolved nutrients, numerous salts
and acids to dissolve waste products. It is a very
good conductor of electricity. It gives support
and protection to the cell organelles. It helps
movement of the cellular materials around
the cell through a process called **cytoplasmic**
**streaming**. Further, most cellular activities
such as many metabolic pathways including
glycolysis and cell division occur in cytoplasm.

#### 6.6 Cell Organelles

**6.6.1 Endomembrane System**

System of membranes in a eukaryotic cell,
comprises the plasma membrane, nuclear
membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi
apparatus, lysosomes and vacuolar membranes
(tonoplast). Endomembranes are made up of
phospholipids with embedded proteins that
are similar to cell membrane which occur
within the cytoplasm. The endomembrane
system is evolved from the inward growth
of cell membrane in the ancestors of the first
eukaryotes (Figure 6.12).

**6.6.2 Endoplasmic Reticulum**

The largest of the internal membranes is called
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The name
**endoplasmic reticulum** was given by **K.R.**
**Porter (1948)**. It consists of double membrane.
Morphologically the structure of endoplasmic
reticulum consists of the following:

1. **Cisternae** are long, broad, flat, sac like
structures arranged in parallel bundles or
stacks to form lamella. The space between
membranes of cisternae is filled with fluid.

2. **Vesicles**are oval membrane bound
vacuolar structure.

3. **Tubules** are irregular in shape, branched,
smooth walled, enclose a space



![](/books/botany/pic15.png)

**Endoplasmic reticulum** is associated
with nuclear membrane and cell surface
membrane. It forms a network in cytoplasm
and gives mechanical support to the cell.
Its chemical environment enables protein
folding and undergo modification necessary
for their function. Misfolded proteins are
pulled out and are degraded in endoplasmic
reticulum. When ribosomes are present in the
outer surface of the membrane it is called as
**rough endoplasmic reticulum(RER)**, when
the ribosomes are absent in the endoplasmic
reticulum it is called as **smooth Endoplasmic**
**reticulum(SER)**. Rough endoplasmic
reticulum is involved in protein synthesis and
smooth endoplasmic reticulum are the sites
of lipid synthesis. The smooth endoplasmic
reticulum contains enzymes that detoxify lipid
soluble drugs, certain chemicals and other
harmful compounds.

#### 6.6.3 Golgi Body (Dictyosomes)

In 1898, **Camillo Golgi** visualized a netlike
reticulum of fibrils near the nucleus, were
named as **Golgi bodies**. In plant cells they
are found as smaller vesicles termed asdictyosomes. Golgi apparatus is a stack of
flat membrane enclosed sacs. It consist of
cisternae, tubules, vesicles and golgi vacuoles.
In plants, the cisternae are 10-20 in number
placed in piles separated from each other by
a thin layer of inter cisternal cytoplasm often
flat or curved. Peripheral edge of cisternae
forms a network of tubules and vesicles.
Tubules interconnect cisternae and are
30-50nm in dimension. Vesicles are large
round or concave sac. They are pinched
off from the tubules.They are smooth/
secretary or coated type. Golgi vacuoles
are large spherical structures filled with
granular or amorphous substance, some
function like lysosomes. Golgi apparatus
compartmentalises a series of steps
leading to the production of functional
protein.

Small pieces of rough endoplasmic
reticulum are pinched off at the ends to form
small vesicles. A number of these vesicles then
join up and fuse together to make a Golgi
body. Golgi complex plays a major role in post
translational modification of proteins and
glycosylation of lipids (Figure 6.13 and 6.14).

**Functions:**

• Production of glycoproteins and glycolipids

• Transporting and storing of lipids.

• Formation of lysosomes.

• Production of digestive enzymes.

• Cell plate and cell wall formation

• Secretion of carbohydrates for the formation
of plant cell walls and insect cuticles.

• Zymogen granules (proenzyme/precursor
of all enzyme) are synthesised.


![](/books/botany/pic16.png)

**6.6.4 Mitochondria**

It was first observed by A. **Kolliker** (1880).
**Altmann** (1894) named it as Bioplasts. Later
**Benda** (1897, 1898), named as mitochondria.
They are ovoid, rounded, rod shape and
pleomorphic structures. Mitochondrion
consists of double membrane, the outer and
inner membrane. The outer membrane is
smooth, highly permeable to small molecules
and it contains proteins called Porins, which
form channels that allows free diffusion
of molecules smaller than about 1000
daltons and the inner membrane divides
mitochondrion into two compartments,
outer chamber between two membranes and
the inner chamber is filled with matrix.
The inner membrane is convoluted
(infoldings), called **crista**(plural: cristae).
Cristae contain most of the enzymes for
electron transport system. Inner chamber of
the mitochondrion is filled with proteinaceous
material called **mitochondrial matrix**. The
Inner membrane consists of stalked particles
called **elementary particles** or **Fernandez**
**Moran particles, F1 particles or Oxysomes.**
Each particle consists of a base, stem and a
round head. In the head, ATP synthase is
present for oxidative phosphorylation. Inner
membrane is impermeable to most ions,
small molecules and maintains the
proton gradient that drives oxidative
phosphorylation (Figure 6.15).


![](/books/botany/pic17.png)

Mitochondria contain 73% of proteins,
25-30% of lipids, 5-7 % of RNA, DNA (in
traces) and enzymes (about 60 types).
Mitochondria are called **Power house of a**
**cell**, as they produce energy rich ATP.
All the enzymes of Kreb’s cycle are found
in the matrix except succinate dehydrogenase.
Mitochondria consist of circular DNA and
70S ribosome. They multiply by fission and
replicates by strand displacement model.

Because of the presence of DNAs it is semi-
autonomous organelle. Unique characteristic
of mitochondria is that they are inherited
from female parent only. Mitochondrial
DNA comparisons are used to trace human
origins. It is also used to track and date
recent evolutionary time because it mutates
5 to 10 time faster than DNA in the nucleus.

**6.6.5 Plastids**

The term plastid is derived from the Greek
word Platikas (formed/moulded) and used
by A.F.U. Schimper in 1885. He classified
plastids into following types according to
their structure, pigments and function.
Plastids multiply by fission.


![](/books/botany/pic19.png)

#### 6.6.6 Chloroplast

Chloroplasts are vital organelle found in
green plants. Chloroplast has a double
membrane the outer membrane and the
inner membrane separated by a space called
**periplastidial space**. The space enclosed by
the inner membrane of chloroplast is filled
with gelatinous matrix, lipo-proteinaceous
fluid called **stroma**. Inside the stroma there
are flat interconnected sacs called **thylakoid.**
The membrane of thylakoid enclose a space
called **thylakoid lumen.**

**Grana** (singular: Granum) are formed
when many of these thylakoids are stacked
together like pile of coins. Light is absorbed
and converted into chemical energy in
the granum, which is used in stroma to
prepare carbohydrates. Thylakoid contain
chlorophyll pigments. The chloroplast
contains osmophilic granules, 70s
ribosomes, DNA (circular and non histone)
and RNA. These chloroplast genome
encodes approximately 30 proteins involved
in photosynthesis including the components
of photosystem I & II, cytochrome bf complex
and ATP synthase. One of the subunits of
RuBisco is encoded by chloroplast DNA. It is
the major protein component of chloroplast
stroma, single most abundant protein on
earth. The thylakoid contain small, rounded
photosynthetic units called quantosomes.
Chloroplast is a semi-autonomous organelle
and divides by fission (Figure 6.16).

**Functions:**

• Photosynthesis

• Light reactions takes place in granum,

• Dark reactions take place in stroma,

• Chloroplast is involved in photo-
respiration.

### 6.6.7 Ribosome

Ribosomes were first observed by **George**
**Palade** (1953) as dense particles or granules
in the electron microscope. Electron
microscopic observation reveals that
ribosomes are composed of two rounded
sub units, united together to form a complete
unit. Mg2+ is required for structural cohesion
of ribosomes. Biogenesis of ribosome is a
de nova formation, auto replication and
nucleolar origin. Each ribosome is made
up of one small and one large sub-unit
Ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis
in the cell. Ribosome is not a membrane
bound organelle (Figure 6.17).


![](/books/botany/pic20.png)


![](/books/botany/pic21.png)



The size of ribosomes
and their subunits
are usually given in
Svedberg unit (named after Theoder
Svedberg, Swedish Chemist Noble
Laureate 1929), a measure of a particle
size dependent on the speed with which
particle sediment in the ultracentrifuge.



Ribosome consists of RNA and protein:
RNA 60 % and protein 40%. During protein
synthesis, many ribosomes are attached to
the single mRNA and is called **polysomes** or
**polyribosomes.** The function of polysomes is
the formation of several copies of a particular
polypeptide during protein synthesis. They
are free in non-protein synthesising cells.
In protein synthesising cells they are linked
together with the help of Mg2<sup>+</sup> ions.


**6.6.8 Lysosomes (Suicidal Bags of Cell)**

Lysosomes were discovered by Christian
de Duve (1953), these are known as
suicidal bags. They are spherical bodies
enclosed by a single unit membrane. They
are found in eukaryotic cell. Lysosomes
are small vacuoles formed when small
pieces of golgi body are pinched off from
its tubules.

They contain a variety of hydrolytic
enzymes, that can digest material within
the cell. The membrane around lysosome
prevent these enzymes from digesting the
cell itself (Figure 6.18).

**Functions:**

* Intracellular digestion: They digest
carbohydrates, proteins and lipids
present in cytoplasm.

* Autophagy: During adverse condition
they digest their own cell organelles like
mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum

* Autolysis: Lysosome causes self
destruction of cell.

*  Ageing: Lysosomes have autolytic enzymes
that disrupts intracellular molecules.

* Phagocytosis: Large cells or contents
are engulfed and digested by
macrophages, thus forming a phagosome
in cytoplasm. These phagosome fuse
with lysosome for further digestion.

* Exocytosis: Lysosomes release their
enzymes outside the cell to digest other
cells (Figure 6.19).

##### 6.6.9 Microbodies

Eukaryotic cells contain many enzyme
bearing membrane enclosed vesicles
called **microbodies**. They are single unit
membrane bound cell organelles. Example:
Peroxisomes and glyoxysomes.

##### 6.6.10 Peroxisomes

Peroxisomes were identified as organelles
by **Christian de Duve (1967)**. Peroxisomes
are small spherical bodies and single
membrane bound organelle. It takes part in
photorespiration and associated with glycolate
metabolism. In plants, leaf cells have many
peroxisomes. It is also commonly found in liver
and kidney of mammals. These are also found
in cells of protozoa and yeast (Figure 6.20).

##### 6.6.11 Glyoxysomes

Glyoxysome was discovered by **Harry**
**Beevers (1961)**. It is a single membrane
bound organelle. It is a sub cellular organelle
and contains enzymes of glyoxylate pathway.
β-oxidation of fatty acid occurs in glyoxysomes
of germinating seeds Example: Castor seeds.

##### 6.6.12 Sphaerosomes

It is spherical in shape and enclosed by
single unit membrane. Example: Storage
of fat in the endosperm cells of oil seeds.

#### 6.6.13 Centrioles

Centrioles consists of nine triplet peripheral
fibrils made up of tubulin. The central part
of the centriole is called hub, is connected to
the tubules of the peripheral triplets by radial
spokes (9+0 pattern). The centriole form the
basal body of cilia or flagella and spindle fibers
which forms the spindle apparatus in animal
cells. The membrane is absent in centriole
(non-membranous organelle) (Figure 6.21).

##### 6.6.14 Vacuoles

In plant cells vacuoles are large, bounded by
a single unit membrane called Tonoplast.
The Vacuoles contain cell sap, which is a
solution of sugars, amino acids, mineral
salts, waste chemical and anthocyanin
pigments. Beetroot cells contain
anthocyanin pigments in their vacuoles.
Vacuoles accumulate products like tannins.
The osmotic expansion of a cell kept in
water is chiefly regulated by vacuole and the
water enters the vacuole by osmosis.
The major function of plant vacuole is
to maintain water pressure known as turgor
pressure, which maintains the plant structure.
Vacuoles organises itself into a storage/
sequestration compartment. Example:
Vacuoles store, most of the sucrose of the cell.

i. Sugar in Sugar beet and Sugar cane.

ii. Malic acid in Apple.

iii. Acids in Citrus fruits.

iv. Flavonoid pigment cyanidin 3 rutinoside
in the petals of Antirrhinum.

##### 6.7. Nucleus
Nucleus is an important unit of cell which
controls all activities of the cell. Nucleus
holds the hereditary information. It is the
largest among all cell organelles. It may be
spherical, cuboidal, ellipsoidal or discoidal.
It is surrounded by a double membrane
structure called **nuclear envelope**, which has
the inner and outer membrane. The inner
membrane is smooth without ribosomes and
the outer membrane is rough by the presence
of ribosomes and it continues with irregular
and infrequent intervals with the endoplasmic
reticulum. The membrane is perforated by
pores known as **nuclear pores** which allows
materials such as mRNA, ribosomal units,
proteins and other macromolecules to pass
in and out of the nucleus. The pores enclosed
by circular structures called **annuli**. The
pore and annuli form the **pore complex**.
The space between two membranes is called
**perinuclear space**.
