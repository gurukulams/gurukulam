The word ‘cell’ comes from the Latin word
‘Celle” which means ‘a small compartment’.
The word cell was first used by Robert
Hooke (1662) therefore the term ‘cell’ is as
old as 300 years.

##### 6.1. Discovery

**Aristotle** (384-322BC), was the
one who first recognised that
animals and plants consists of organised
structural units but unable to explain what
it was. In 1660’s Robert Hooke observed
something which looks like ‘honeycomb with
a great numbers of little boxes’ which was later
called as ‘cell’ from the cork tissue. In 1665,
He compiled his work as Micrographia.
Later, Anton Van Leeuwenhoek observed
unicellular particles which he named as
‘animalcules’. Robert Brown (1831-39)
described the spherical body in plant cell as
nucleus. H. J. Dutrochet (1824), a French
scientist, was the first to give an idea on cell
theory. Later, Matthias Schleiden (German
Botanist) and Theodor Schwann (German
Zoologist) (1833) outlined the basic features
of the cell theory. Rudolf Virchow (1858)
explained the cell theory by adding a
feature stating that all living cells arise from
pre-existing living cells by ‘cell division’.

#### 6.2. Microscopy

 Microscope is an inevitable instrument in
studying the cell and subcellular structures. It
offers scope in studying microscopic organisms
therefore it is named as microscope (mikros –
small; skipein – to see) in Greek terminology.
Compound microscope was invented by
**Z.Jansen.**

Microscope basically works on the
lens system and its properties of light and
lens such as reflection, magnification and
numerical aperture. The common light
microscope which has many lenses are called
as compound microscope. The microscope
transmits visible light from sources to eye or
camera through sample.

#### 6.2.1 Bright field Microscope

Bright field microscope is the routinely used
microscope in studying various aspects of
cells. It allows light to pass directly through
specimen and shows a well distinguished
image from different portions of the
specimen. The contrast can be increased
by staining the specimen with reagent that
reacts with cells and tissue components of
the object.

The light rays are focused by condenser
on to the specimen on a microslide placed
upon the adjustable platform called stage.
Light comes from the Compact Flourescent
Lamp (CFL) or Light Emitting Diode (LED).
Then it passes through two lens systems
namely objective lens (closer to the object)
and the eye piece (closer to eye). There are
four objective lenses (5X, 10X, 45X and
100X) which can be rotated and fixed at
certain point to get required magnification.
It works on the principle of numerical
aperture value and its own resolving power.
The first magnification of the
microscope is done by the objective lens
which is called primary magnification
and it is real, inverted image. The second

Resolution: The term resolving
power or resolution refers to the
ability of lenses to show the details
of object lying between two points. It
is the finest detail available from an
object. It can be calculated using the
following formula.

{{<box title = "Learning Objectives">}}

Where, λ= wavelength of the light and
NA is the numerical aperture.
Numerical Aperture: It is an important
optical constant associated with the
optical lens denoting the ability to resolve.
Higher the NA value greater will be the
resolving power of the microscope.
Magnification: The optical
increase in size of an image is called
magnification. It is calculated by the
size of image seen with the microscope
size of the image seen with normal eye

magnification of the microscope is obtained
through eye piece lens called as secondary
magnification and it is virtual and inverted
image (Figure 6.2 a, b and c).

##### 6.2.2 Electron Microscope

Electron Microscope was first introduced
by Ernest Ruska (1931) and developed
by G Binning and H Roher (1981). It is
used to analyse the fine details of cell and
organelles called ultrastructure. It uses
beam of accelerated electrons as source of
illumination and therefore the resolving
power is 1,00,000 times greater than that of
light microscope.

The specimen to be viewed under
electron microscope is dehydrated and
impregnated with electron opaque
chemicals like gold or palladium. This is
essential for withstanding electrons and
also for contrast of the image.

There are two kinds of electron
microscopes namely:
1. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)
2. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
1. Transmission electron microscope:
This is the most commonly used electron
microscope which provides two dimensional
image. The components of the microscope
are as follows
a. Electron generating system
b. Electron condensor
c. Specimen objective
d. Tube lens
e. Projector

A beam of electron passes through the
specimen to form an image on fluorescent
screen. The magnification is 1–3 lakhs times
and resolving power is 2–10 Å. It is used
for studying detailed structrue of viruses,

mycoplasma, cellular organelles, etc (Figure
6.3 a and b).

#### 2. Scanning Electron Microscope:

This is used to obtain three dimensional
image and has a lower resolving power than
TEM. In this, electrons are focused by means
of lenses into a very fine point. The interaction
of electrons with the specimen results in the
release of different forms of radiation (such
as auger electrons, secondary electrons, back
scattered electrons) from the surface of the
specimen. These radiations are then captured
by an appropriate detector, amplified and
then imaged on fluorescent screen. The
magnification is 2,00,000 times and resolution
is 5–20 nm (Figure 6.4 a and b).

#### 6.3. Cell Theory

In 1833, German botanist Matthias
Schleiden and German zoologist Theodor
Schwann proposed that all plants and
animals are composed of cells and that cells
were the basic building blocks of life.

• All organisms are made up of cells.
• New cells are formed by the division of
pre-existing cells.
• Cells contains genetic material, which is
passed on from parents to daughter cells.
• All metabolic reactions take place
inside the cells.

#### 6.3.1 Exception to Cell Theory

Viruses are puzzle in biology. Viruses,
viroids and prions are the exception to cell
theory. They lack protoplasm, the essential
part of the cell and exists as obligate parasites
which are sub-cellular in nature.

#### 6.3.2 Protoplasm Theory
Corti first observed protoplasm. Felix
Dujardin (1835) observed a living juice in
animal cell and called it “Sarcode”. Purkinje
(1839) coined the term protoplasm for sap
inside a plant cell. Hugo Van Mohl (1846)
indicated importance of protoplasm.

Microscopic measurements:
The microscope also has facility
to measure microscopic objects
through a technique called
‘micrometry’. There are two scales
involved for measuring.
1. Ocular Micrometre
2. Stage Micrometre
Ocular Micrometre: It is fixed inside the eye piece lens.
It is a thin transparent glass disc where there are lines
divided into 100 equal units. The scale has no value.
Stage Micrometre:This is a slide with a line divided
into 100 units. The line is about 10mm. The distance
between two adjacent lines is 10 μm. The known
value of the stage micrometre is transferred to the ocular micrometre, thereby the
measurement can be made using ocular micrometre.
The distance between two adjacent line of ocular meter= Number of stage divisions
Number of ocular divisions

**MaxSchultze** (1861) established
similarity between Protoplasm and Sarcode
and proposed a theory which later on called
“Protoplasm Theory” by O. Hertwig
(1892). Huxley (1868) proposed Protoplasm
as a “physical basis of life”.

 **Protoplasm as a Colloidal System**

Protoplasm is a complex colloidal system which
was suggested by Fisher in 1894 and Hardy in
1899. It is primarily made of water and various
other solutes of biological importance such
as glucose, fatty acids, amino acids, minerals,
vitamins, hormones and enzymes.
These solutes may be homogeneous
(soluble in water) or heterogeneous mass
(insoluble in water) which forms the basis
for its colloidal nature.

**Physical Properties of Protoplasm**
The protoplasm exists either in semisolid
(jelly-like) state called ‘gel ̓ due to suspended
particles and various chemical bonds or
may be liquid state called ‘sol ̓.The colloidal

protoplasm which is in gel form can change
into sol form by solation and the sol can
change into gel by gelation. These gel-sol
conditions of colloidal system are prime basis
for mechanical behaviour of cytoplasm.


1. Protoplasm is translucent, odourless and
polyphasic fluid.

2. It is a crystal colloid solution which is a
mixture of chemical substances forming
crystalloid i.e. true solution (sugars, salts,
acids, bases) and others forming colloidal
solution (Proteins and lipids)

3. It is the most important property of the
protoplasm by which it exhibits three main
phenomena namely Brownian movement,
amoeboid movement and cytoplasmic
streaming or cyclosis. Viscosity of
protoplasm is 2–20 centipoises. The
Refractive index of the protoplasm is 1.4.

4. The pH of the protoplasm is around 6.8,
contain 90% water (10% in dormant seeds)
5. Approximately 34 elements are present
in protoplasm but only 13 elements are
main or universal elements i.e. C, H, O, N,
Cl, Ca, P, Na, K, S, Mg, I and Fe. Carbon,
Hydrogen, Oxygen and Nitrogen form the
96% of protoplasm.

6. Protoplasm is neither a good nor a
bad conductor of electricity. It forms a
delimiting membrane in contact with
water and solidifies when heated.
7. Cohesiveness: Particles or molecules of
protoplasm are adhered with each other by
forces, such as Van der Waal’s bonds, that
hold long chains of molecules together.
This property varies with the strength of
these forces.

8. Contractility: The contractility of proto-
plasm is important for the absorption and

removal of water especially for stomatal
operations.
9. Surface tension: The proteins and lipids of
the protoplasm have less surface tension,
hence they are found at the surface forming
the membrane. On the other hand the
chemical substances (NaCl) have high
surface tension, so they occur in deeper
parts of the protoplasm.


**6.3.3 Cell sizes and shapes**
Cell greatly vary in size, shape and also in
function. Group of cells with similar structures
are called tissue they integrate together to
perform similar function, group of tissue
join together to perform similar function
called organ, group of organs with related
function called organ system, organ system
coordinating together to form an organism.
Shape

The shape of cell vary greatly from organism
to organism and within the organism itself. In
bacteria, cell shape vary from round (cocci)
to rectangular (rod). In virus, shape of the
envelope varies from round to hexagonal or
‘T’ shaped. In fungi, globular to elongated
cylindrical cells and the spores of fungi vary

![](/books/botany/pic6.png)

![](/books/botany/pic7.png)

greatly in shape. In plants and animals cells
vary in shape according to cell types such as
parenchyma, mesophyll, palisade, tracheid,
fiber, epithelium and others (Figure 6.6).

**6.4. Types of cells**

On the basis of the cellular organization and
the nuclear characteristics, the cell can be
classified into
• Prokaryotes
• Mesokaryotes and
• Eukaryotes

**6.4.1 Prokaryotes**

Those organisms with primitive nucleus are
called as prokaryotes (pro – primitive; karyon
– nucleus). The DNA lies in the ‘nucleoid’
which is not bound by the nuclear membrane
and therefore it is not a true nucleus and is
also a primitive type of nuclear material. The
DNA is without histone proteins. Example:
Bacteria, blue green algae, Mycoplasma,
Rickettsiae and Spirochaetae.

**6.4.2 Mesokaryotes**
In the year 1966, scientist Dodge and his
coworkers proposed another kind of organisms
called mesokaryotes. These organisms
which shares some of the characters of both
prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In other words
these are organisms intermediate between
pro and eukaryotes. These contains well
organized nucleus with nuclear membrane
and the DNA is organized into chromosomes
but without histone protein components
divides through amitosis similar with
prokaryotes. Certain Protozoa like
Noctiluca, some phytoplanktons like
Gymnodinium, Peridinium and Dinoflagellates
are representatives of mesokaryotes.

**6.4.3 Eukaryotes**

Those organisms which have true nucleus
are called Eukaryotes (Eu – True; karyon –
nucleus). The DNA is associated with histones
forming the chromosomes. Membrane bound
organelles are present. Few organelles may
have risen by endosymbiosis which is a cell
living inside another cell. The Organelles like
mitochondria and chloroplast well support
this theory.

**Origin of Eukaryotic cell:**

Endosymbiont theory: Two eukaryotic
organelles believed to be the descendants
of the endosymbiotic prokaryotes. The
ancestors of the eukaryotic cell engulfed
a bacterium and the bacteria continued
to function inside the host cell.

**Comparison between types of cellular organisation**
