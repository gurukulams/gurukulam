If you are sleeping under a tree during
night time you will feel difficulty in breathing.
During night, plants take up oxygen and
release carbon dioxide and as a result carbon
dioxide will be abundant around the tree.
This process of CO 2 evolution is called
respiration. This process takes place during
day time also (Figure 14.1). It is accompanied
by breakdown of substrates and release of
energy. In this chapter, respiration process in
plants at cellular level will be dealt with.

**Plant and Animal Interdependence** <br>
In biosphere, plants and animals are
complementary systems which are integrated
to sustain life. In plants, oxygen enters
through the stomata and it is transported
to cells, where oxygen is utilized for energy
production. Plants require carbon dioxide
to survive, to produce carbohydrates and
to release oxygen through photosynthesis.
These oxygen molecules are inhaled by
human through the nose, which reaches the
lungs where oxygen is transported through
the blood and it reaches cells. Cellular
respiration takes place inside the cell. A
specialized respiratory system is present in
animals but is absent in plants for delivering
oxygen inside the cell. But the cellular
respiration stages are similar in both plants
and animals which hint at evolutionary
divergence.<br>

#### 14.1 Gaseous Exchange <br>
##### 14.1.1 Respiration <br>
The term respiration was coined by **Pepys**
(1966). Respiration is a biological process in
which oxidation of various food substances
like carbohydrates, proteins and fats take place
and as a result of this, energy is produced
where O 2 is taken in and CO 2 is liberated. The
organic substances which are oxidised during
respiration are called respiratory substrates.
Among these, glucose is the commonest
respiratory substrate. Breaking of C-C bonds <br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/respiration/02.png) <br>
**Figure 14.1:** Gaseous exchange in plants <br>
of complex organic compounds through
oxidation within the cells leads to energy
release. The energy released during respiration
is stored in the form of ATP (Adenosine Tri
Phosphate) as well as liberated heat. Respiration
occurs in all the living cells of organisms. The
overall process of respiration corresponds to a
reversal of photosynthesis.<br>
${C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2   --> 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + Energy}$  <br>
686 K cal or 2868 KJ) <br>
 (1K cal = 4.184 KJ)  <br>
Depending upon the nature of respiratory
substrate, **Blackman** divided respiration into,<br>
1. Floating respiration <br>
2. Protoplasmic respiration <br>
When carbohydrate or fat or organic acid
serves as respiratory substrate and it is called
**floating respiration**. It is a common mode
of respiration and does not produce any
toxic product. Whereas respiration utilizing
protein as a respiratory substrate, it is called
**protoplasmic respiration.** Protoplasmic
respiration is rare and it depletes structural
and functional proteins of protoplasm and
liberates toxic ammonia.

#### 14.1.2 Compensation point <br>
At dawn and dusk the intensity of light
is low. The point at which ${CO_2}$  released
in respiration is exactly compensated by
${CO_2}$  fixed in photosynthesis that means
no net gaseous exchange takes place, it
is called **compensation point**. At this
moment, the amount of oxygen released
from photosynthesis is equal to the
amount of oxygen utilized in respiration.
The two common factors associated with
compensation point are ${CO_2}$ and light
(Figure 14.2). Based on this there are two
types of compensation point. They are CO2
compensation point and light compensation
point. ${C_3}$ plants have compensation points
ranging from 40-60 ppm (parts per million)
${CO_2}$  while those of ${C_4}$ plants ranges from
1-5 ppm ${CO_2}$  .<br>

**Figure 14.2:** Compensation point

#### 14.2 Structure of ATP <br>
Respiration is responsible for generation
of ATP. The discovery of ATP was made by
**Karl Lohman** (1929). ATP is a nucleotide
consisting of a base-adenine, a pentose
sugar-ribose and three phosphate groups.
Out of three phosphate groups the last two
are attached by high energy rich bonds
(Figure 14.3). On hydrolysis, it releases
energy (7.3 K cal or 30.6 KJ/ATP) and it is
found in all living cells and hence it is called
**universal energy currency of the cell**. ATP
is an instant source of energy within the
cell. The energy contained in ATP is used in
synthesis carbohydrates, proteins and lipids.
The energy transformation concept was
established by **Lipman** (1941).

#### 14.3 Redox Reactions

${ NAD^+ + 2e + 2H^+ -> NADH + H^+ }$ <br>
${FAD + 2e + 2H^+ -> FADH_2 }$




When NAD 1 (Nicotinamide Adenine
Dinucleotide-oxidised form) and FAD (Flavin
Adenine Dinucleotide) pick up electrons and
one or two hydrogen ions (protons), they
get reduced to ${NADH + H^+}$ and ${FADH_2}$
respectively. When they drop electrons and
hydrogen off they go back to their original
form. The reaction in which ${NAD^+}$ and FAD
gain (reduction) or lose (oxidation) electrons
are called **redoxreaction** (Oxidation reduction
reaction). These reactions are important in
cellular respiration. <br>
#### 14.4 Types of Respiration <br>
Respiration is classified into two types as
aerobic and anaerobic respiration (Figure 14.4)

#### 14.4.1 Aerobic respiration 
Respiration occurring in the presence of oxygen
is called **aerobic respiration**. During aerobic
respiration, food materials like carbohydrates,
fats and proteins are completely oxidised into
${CO_2}$, ${H_2O}$ and energy is released. Aerobic
respiration is a very complex process and is
completed in four major steps: <br>
1. Glycolysis <br>
2. Pyruvate oxidation (Link reaction) <br>
3. Krebs cycle (TCA cycle) <br>
4. Electron Transport Chain (Terminal
oxidation).<br>

#### 14.4.2 Anaerobic respiration 
In the absence of molecular oxygen glucose is
incompletely degraded into either ethyl alcohol
or lactic acid (Table 14.1). It includes two steps: <br>
1. Glycolysis <br>
2. Fermentation

ATP is not only higher energy
compound present in a cell.
There are other higher energy
compounds also present.

#### 14.5 Stages of Respiration <br>
1. Glycolysis-conversion of glucose into
pyruvic acid in cytoplasm of cell.<br>
2. Link reaction-conversion of pyruvic acid
into acetyl coenzyme-A in mitochondrial
matrix.<br>
3. Krebs cycle-conversion of acetyl coenzyme
A into carbon dioxide and water in the
mitochondrial matrix.<br>
4. Electron transport chain to tranfer electrons
electrons from the products of glycolysis,
remove hydrogen ions and tranfer
link reaction and Krebs cycle It takes
place in mitochondrial inner membrane
to release ATP with water molecule by
terminal oxidation (Figure 14.5). <br>

#### 14.5.1 Glycolysis
(Gr: Glykos 5 Glucose, Lysis 5 Splitting)
Glycolysis is a linear series of reactions in
which 6-carbon glucose is split into two
molecules of 3-carbon pyruvic acid. The
enzymes which are required for glycolysis are
present in the cytoplasm (Figure 14.6). The
reactions of glycolysis were worked out in
yeast cells by three scientists **Gustav Embden**
(German), **Otto Meyerhoff** (German) and **J Parnas** (Polish)
and so it is also called as EMP
pathway. It is the first and common stage for
both aerobic and anaerobic respiration. It is
divided into two phases.<br>
**1. Preparatory phase** or endergonic phase or
hexose phase (steps 1-5).<br>
**2. Pay off phase** or oxidative phase or
exergonic phase or triose phase (steps 6-10).<br>

**1. Preparatory phase** <br>
Glucose enters the glycolysis from sucrose
which is the end product of photosynthesis.
Glucose is phosphorylated into glucose-6-
phosphate by the enzyme hexokinase, and
subsequent reactions are carried out by
different enzymes (Figure 14.6). At the end
of this phase fructose-1, 6 - bisphosphate is
cleaved into glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate
and dihydroxy acetone phosphate by the
enzyme aldolase. These two are isomers.
Dihydroxy acetone phosphate is isomerised
into glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate by the
enzyme triose phosphate isomerase, now two
molecules of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate enter
into pay off phase. During preparatory phase
two ATP molecules are consumed in step-1
and step-3 (Figure 14.6).<br>
{{<box title="">}}
**Check your grasp!** <br>

from one sucrose molecule?
{{</box>}}<br>
#### 2. Pay off phase <br>
Two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate oxidatively phosphorylated into
two molecules of 1,3 - bisphospho glycerate. During this reaction
${ 2NAD^+}$is reduced to 2NADH + ${H^+}$by glyceraldehyde- 3- phosphate
dehydrogenase at step 6. Further
reactions are carried out by different
enzymes and at the end two
molecules of pyruvate are produced.
In this phase, 2ATPs are produced at
step 7 and 2 ATPs at step10 (Figure 14.6). Direct transfer of phosphate
moiety from substrate molecule to
ADP and is converted into ATP is
called **substrate phosphorylation** <br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/respiration/08.png) <br>
**Figure 14.6:** Glycolysis or EMP pathway <br>
or direct phosphorylation or trans
phosphorylation. During the reaction at
step 9, 2 phospho glycerate dehydrated into
Phospho enol pyruvate. A water molecule is
removed by the enzyme enolase. As a result,
enol group is formed within the molecule.
This process is called **Enolation.** <br>
**3. Energy Budget** <br>
In the pay off phase totally 4ATP and
${2NADH + H^+}$ molecules are produced.
Since 2ATP molecules are already consumed
in the preparatory phase, the net products in
glycolysis are 2ATPs and ${2NADH + H^+}$ .

#### 14.5.2 Pyruvate Oxidation (Link reaction) <br>
Two molecules of pyruvate formed by glycolysis
in the cytosol enters into the mitochondrial
matrix. In aerobic respiration this pyruvate
with coenzyme A is oxidatively decarboxylated
into acetyl CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase
complex. This reaction is irreversible and
produces two molecules of NADH + H+ and
2CO2. It is also called **transition reaction**
or **Link reaction.** The reaction of pyruvate
oxidation is <br>
${2xCH_3COCOOH + 2NAD^{+} + 2CoA}$ <br>

of three distinct enzymes, such as<br>

2. Dihydrolipoyil transacetylase<br>
3. Dihydrolipoyil dehydrogenase
and five different coenzymes,<br>
TPP (Thymine Pyro Phosphate),<br>

#### 14.5.3 Krebs cycle or Citric acid cycle or TCA cycle: <br>
Two molecules of acetyl CoA formed from
link reaction now enter into Krebs cycle.
It is named after its discoverer, German
Biochemist **Sir Hans Adolf Krebs** (1937).
The enzymes necessary for TCA cycle
are found in mitochondrial matrix except
succinate dehydrogenase enzyme which is
found in mitochondrial inner membrane 
(Figure 14.7) <br>

**Sir Hans Adolf Krebs**
was born in Germany
on 25 th August 1900.
He was awarded Nobel
Prize for his discovery
of Citric acid cycle in
Physiology in 1953.
{{</box>}} <br>
TCA cycle starts with condensation
of acetyl CoA with oxaloacetate in the
presence of water to yield citrate or citric<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/respiration/11.png) <br>
**Figure 14.8:** Krebs cycle or Citric acid cycle <br>
acid. Therefore, it is also known as **Citric**
**Acid Cycle (CAC) or Tri Carboxylic Acid**
**(TCA) cycle.** It is followed by the action of
different enzymes in cyclic manner. During
the conversion of succinyl CoA to succinate
by the enzyme succinyl CoA synthetase
or succinate thiokinase, a molecule of
ATP synthesis from substrate without
entering the electron transport chain is
called **substrate level phosphorylation**. In
animals a molecule of GTP is synthesized
from GDP + Pi. In a coupled reaction GTP
is converted to GDP with simultaneous
synthesis of ATP from ADP + Pi. In three
steps (4, 6, 10) in this cycle ${NAD_+}$ is reduced
to NADH + ${H^+}$ and at step 8 (Figure14.8)
where FAD is reduced to FADH2 .<br>
The summary of link reaction and Krebs
cycle in Mitochondria is <br>
Pyruvic acid + \\(4NAD^+\\)  + FAD  + \\(4H_2O\\) + ADP + Pi <br>
        
          | 
          |   Mitochondrial matrix.
          v   
${3CO_2 + 4NADH + 4H^+ + FADH_2 + H_2O + ATP}$ <br>
Two molecules of pyruvic acid formed at the
end of glycolysis enter into the mitochondrial
matrix. Therefore, Krebs cycle is repeated
twice for every glucose molecule where
two molecules of pyruvic acid produces six
molecules of ${CO_2}$, eight molecules of NADH + ${H_+}$ , two molecules of ${FADH_2}$ and two
molecules of ATP.<br>
1. Significance of Krebs cycle:<br>
1.TCA cycle is to provide energy in the form
of ATP for metabolism in plants.<br>
2.It provides carbon skeleton or raw material
for various anabolic processes.<br>
3.Many intermediates of TCA cycle are
further metabolised to produce amino acids,
proteins and nucleic acids.<br>
4.Succinyl CoA is raw material for formation
of chlorophylls, cytochrome, phytochrome
and other pyrrole substances.<br>
5.α-ketoglutarate and oxaloacetate undergo
reductive amination and produce amino
acids.<br>
6.It acts as metabolic sink which plays a
central role in intermediary metabolism.<br>
**2. Amphibolic nature** <br>
Krebs cycle is primarily a catabolic pathway,
but it provides precursors for various
biosynthetic pathways there by an anabolic
pathway too. Hence, it is called **amphibolic**
**pathway.** It serves as a pathway for oxidation
of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. When fats
are respiratory substrate they are first broken
down into glycerol and fatty acid. Glycerol is
converted into DHAP and acetyl CoA. This
acetyl CoA enter into the Krebs cycle. When
proteins are the respiratory substrate they are
degraded into amino acids by proteases. The
amino acids after deamination enter into the
Krebs cycle through pyruvic acid or acetyl
CoA and it depends upon the structure.
So respiratory intermediates form the link
between synthesis as well as breakdown.
The citric acid cycle is the final common
pathway for oxidation of fuel molecules like
amino acids, fatty acids and carbohydrates.
Therefore, respiratory pathway is an
amphibolic pathway (Figure 14.9).<br>

**Figure 14.9:** Alternative substrates for respiration <br>
#### 14.5.4 Electron Transport Chain (ETC)(Terminal oxidation) <br>
During glycolysis, link reaction and Krebs
cycle the respiratory substrates are oxidised
at several steps and as a result
many reduced coenzymes
NADH + H+ and FADH2
are produced. These reduced
coenzymes are transported
to inner membrane of
mitochondria and are converted back to their
oxidised forms produce electrons and protons.
In mitochondria, the inner membrane is folded
in the form of finger projections towards
the matrix called cristae. In cristae many
oxysomes (F1 particles) are present which have
electron transport carriers. According to **Peter**
**Mitchell’s Chemiosmotic theory** this electron
transport is coupled to ATP synthesis. Electron
and hydrogen(proton) transport takes place
across four multiprotein complexes(I-IV).
They are <br>
**1. Complex-I (NADH dehydrogenase).** It
contains a flavoprotein(FMN) and associated
with non-heme iron Sulphur protein (Fe-S).
This complex is responsible for passing
NADH (**Internal**) to Ubiquinone (UQ).
electrons and protons from mitochondria<br>
$\mathrm{NADH + H^+ + UQ <=> NAD^+ + UQH_2}$ <br>

**In plants,** an additional NADH
dehydrogenase **(External)** complex is present
on the outer surface of inner membrane of
mitochondria which can oxidise cytosolic
NADH + ${H^+}$ . Because mitochondrial inner
membrane cannot allow NADH molecules
directly into the matrix.
Ubiquinone (UQ) or Coenzyme Quinone
(CoQ) is a small, lipid soluble electron, proton
carrier located within the inner membrane of
mitochondria.<br>
**2. Complex-II (Succinic dehydrogenase)** <br>
It contains FAD flavoprotein is associated
with non-heme iron Sulphur (Fe-S) protein.
This complex receives electrons and protons
from succinate in Krebs cycle and is converted
into fumarate and passes to ubiquinone.<br>
Succinate + UQ → Fumarate + ${UQH_2}$ <br>
**3. Complex-III (Cytochrome ${bc_1}$ complex)** <br>
This complex oxidises reduced ubiquinone
(ubiquinol) and transfers the electrons 
through Cytochrome bc 1 Complex (Iron
Sulphur center bc 1 complex) to cytochrome
c. Cytochrome c is a small protein attached
to the outer surface of inner membrane and
act as a mobile carrier to transfer electrons
between complex III to complex IV.<br>

Ubiquinone and
cytochrome bc 1 complex
are structurally
and functionally similar to
plastoquinone and cytochrome b 6, f complex
respectively in the photosynthetic electron
transport chain.
{{</box>}} <br>
**4. Complex IV (Cytochome c oxidase)**
This complex contains two copper centers
(A and B) and cytochromes a and a 3.
Complex IV is the terminal oxidase and
brings about the reduction of ${1/2 O_2}$ to ${H_2O}$.
Two protons are needed to form a molecule
of ${H_2O}$ (terminal oxidation).<br>

 The transfer of electrons from reduced
coenzyme NADH to oxygen via complexes I
to IV is coupled to the synthesis of ATP from
ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) which
is called **Oxidative phosphorylation.** The
${F_{0}F_{1}-ATP}$ synthase (also called complex V)
consists of ${F_0}$ and ${F_1}$ . ${F_1}$ converts ADP and Pi
to ATP and is attached to the matrix side of
the inner membrane. ${F_0}$ is present in inner
membrane and acts as a channel through
which protons come into matrix.  <br>

The synthesis of glucose from certain non- carbohydrate
carbon substrates such as proteins
and lipids are called **gluconeogenesis.**
{{</box>}}<br>
Oxidation of one
molecule of NADH + ${H^+}$
gives rise to 3 molecules
of ATP and oxidation
of one molecule ${FADH_2}$
produces 2 molecules
of ATP within a
mitochondrion.But cytoplasmic ${NADH + H^+}$
yields only two ATPs
through external NADH
dehydrogenase. Therefore, two reduced coenzyme ${(NADH + H^+ )}$ molecules from
glycolysis being extra mitochondrial will yield 2 X 2 = 4 ATP molecules instead of
6 ATPs (Figure 14.10).<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/respiration/12.png) <br>
**Figure 14.10:** Electron Transport Chain and Terminal Oxidation <br>
 The Mechanism of mitochondrial ATP synthesis is based
on Chemiosmotic hypothesis. According to this theory electron carriers present in
the inner mitochondrial membrane allow for the transfer of protons ${(H^+)}$. For the
production of single ATP, 3 protons (H+) are needed. The terminal oxidation of external
NADH bypasses the first phosphorylation site and hence only two ATP molecules 
are produced per external NADH oxidised through mitochondrial electron transport chain. However, in those animal tissues in which malate shuttle mechanism is present,
the oxidation of external NADH will yield almost 3 ATP molecules.Complete oxidation of a glucose molecule in aerobic respiration results in the net gain of **36 ATP molecules in plants** as shown in table 14.2. Since huge amount of energy is generated in mitochondria in the form ofATP molecules they are called **‘power house of the cell’.** In the case of aerobic prokaryotes
due to lack of mitochondria each molecule of glucose produces 38 ATP molecules.<br>

Abnormal rise in respiratory rate of ripening in fruits is called **Climacteric.** 
Examples are :apple, banana, mango, papaya, pear.

**Recent view** <br>
When the cost of transport of ATPs from matrix into the cytosol is considered,the number will be 2.5 ATPs for each NADH + ${H^+}$ and 1.5 ATPs for each ${FADH_2}$ oxidised during electron transport system. <br>


**Create Table** 

Therefore, in plant cells net yield of 30 ATP
molecules for complete aerobic oxidation of
one molecule of glucose. But in those animal
cells (showing malate shuttle mechanism)
net yield will be 32 ATP molecules.<br>

#### 14.6 Respiratory Quotient (RQ) <br>
The ratio of volume of carbon dioxide given
out and volume of oxygen taken in during
respiration is called **Respiratory Quotient** or  
**Respiratory ratio.** RQ value depends upon
respiratory substrates and their oxidation. <br>

$ RQ=\frac{Volume  of  CO_2  liberated}{Volume  of  O_2  consumed} $ <br>

1. The respiratory substrate is a carbohydrate,
it will be completely oxidised in aerobic
respiration and the value of the RQ will be
equal to unity. <br>

${C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 6O_2 -> 6CO_2 ↑ + 6H_2O + Energy }$

$ RQ=\frac{6 molecules of CO_2}{6 molecules of O_2}$ <br> =1 (unity)

2. If the respiratory substrate is a carbohydrate
it will be incompletely oxidised when it goes
through anaerobic respiration and the RQ
value will be infinity. <br>
${C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}  -> 2CO_2 ↑ + 2C_2H_5OH + Energy }$  <br>
  Glucose $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$ Ethyl alcohol  <br>

$ RQ of glucose anaerobically =\frac{2 molecules of CO_2}{zero molecules of O_2}$  <br> 
   $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$ = ∞ (infinity)
    <br>
3. In some succulent plants like *Opuntia*,
*Bryophyllum* carbohydrates are partially
oxidised to organic acid, particularly malic acid
without corresponding release of ${CO_2}$ but ${O_2}$ is
consumed hence the RQ value will be zero.  <br>

${2C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 3O_2  -> 3C_{4}H_{6}O_{5} + 3H_2O + Energy }$ <br>
 Glucose$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$Malic acid       <br>

 $RQ of Glucose in succulents =\frac{zero molecule of CO_2}{3 molecules of O_2}$ <br>
   &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; =0(zero        <br>
    
4. When respiratory substrate is protein or
fat, then RQ will be less than unity.) <br>
${2\(C_{51}H_{98}O_6\) + 145O_2 -> 102CO_2↑ + 98H_2O + Energy}$ <br>
Tripalmitin(Fat)<br>
${RQ of Tripalmitin = \frac{102 molecules of CO 2}{145 molecules of O 2}}$ <br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$     =5 0.7 (less than unity)

5. When respiratory substrate is an organic
acid the value of RQ will be more than unity.<br>
${C_4H_6O_5 + 3O_2 --> 4CO_2 ↑ + 3H_2O + Energy}$ <br>
Malic acid <br>

${RQ of 5 malic acid = \frac{4 molecules of CO 2}{3 molecules of O 2}}$<br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$=1.33 (more than unity)<br>
**Significance of RQ** <br>
1. RQ value indicates which type of
respiration occurs in living cells, either
aerobic or anaerobic.<br>
2. It also helps to know which type of
respiratory substrate is involved.<br>

{{<box title="">}}

Red colour in various
parts of plants is due to the
presence of anthocyanin,
synthesis of which require
more \\(O_2\\) than \\(CO_2\\) evolved. RQ will be
less than one.

Take a test tube with some germinated seeds
and fill with water. Keep this test tube after
some time until liberation of ${CO_2}$. When the
carbon dioxide from respiration is mixed to
water, carbonic acid $\(H_2CO_3\)$ is produced.
Therefore, as more carbon dioxide is
released, the solution becomes more acidic.
You will see changes in pH as an indicator
using blue litmus paper changed into red that
respiration has occurred<br>

#### `14.7 Anaerobic Respiration`<br>
##### 14.7.1 Fermentation <br>
Some organisms can respire
in the absence of oxygen.
This process is called
**fermentation or anaerobic respiration** (Figure 14.12). There are three
types of fermentation:<br>
1. Alcoholic fermentation <br>
2. Lactic acid fermentation<br>
3. Mixed acid fermentation<br>

**1. Alcoholic fermentation**<br>
The cells of roots in water logged soil
respire by alcoholic fermentation because
of lack of oxygen by converting pyruvic
acid into ethyl alcohol and \\(CO_2\\) . Many
species of yeast *(Saccharomyces)* also
respire anaerobically. This process takes
place in two steps:<br>
(i) ${2CH_3COCOOH  --->  [\text{Pyruvate decarboxylas}][\text{TPP}] 2CH_3CHO + 2CO_2}$ <br>


(ii) ${2CH_3CHO + 2NADH+2H^+  ----> 2CH_3CH_2OH + 2NAD^+}$ <br>

acid and gases like \\(CO_2\\) and \\(H_2\\).  <br>
**Characteristics of Anaerobic Respiration**<br>
1.Anaerobic respiration is less efficient than
the aerobic respiration (Figure 14.12).<br>
2.Limited number of ATP molecules is
generated per glucose molecule (Table 14.4).<br>

 #### 14.9 Pentose Phosphate Pathway (Phospho Gluconate Pathway) <br>
 During respiration breakdown of glucose in
cytosol occurs both by glycolysis (about 2/3)
as well as by oxidative pentose phosphate
pathway (about 1/3). Pentose phosphate
pathway was described by **Warburg,**
**Dickens** and **Lipmann (1938)**. Hence, it is
also called **Warburg-Dickens-Lipmann pathway.** It takes place in cytoplasm of
mature plant cells. It is an alternate way for
breakdown of glucose (Figure 14.15).<br>

**Figure 14.15:** Fate of Glucose in HMP shunt and Glycolysis <br>
It is also known as**Hexose monophosphate shunt (HMP Shunt)** or **Direct Oxidative Pathway**. It consists of two phases, oxidative phase and non-oxidative phase. The oxidative events convert six molecules of six carbon Glucose-6-phosphate to 6 molecules
of five carbon sugar Ribulose-5 phosphate
with loss of 6CO 2 molecules and generation
of 12 NADPH + \\(H^+\\) (not NADH). The
remaining reactions known as **non-oxidative pathway**, convert Ribulose-5-phosphate
molecules to various intermediates such
asRibose-5-phosphate(5C),
Xylulose-5-phosphate(5C),
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate(3C), Sedoheptulose-7-Phosphate
(7C), and Erythrose-4-phosphate (4C).
Finally, five molecules of glucose-6-
phosphate is regene-rated (Figure 14.16).
The overall reaction is:<br>
**6 x Glucose-6-Phosphate + \\(12NADP^+\\) + \\(6H_2O\\)** <br>

Significance of pentose phosphate pathway
1.HMP shunt is associated with the generation
of two important products, NADPH and
pentose sugars, which play a vital role in
anabolic reactions.<be>
2.Coenzyme NADPH generated is used for
reductive biosynthesis and counter damaging
the effects of oxygen free radicals<br>
3.Ribose-5-phosphate and its derivatives are
used in the synthesis of DNA, RNA, ATP,
\\(NAD^+\\) , FAD and Coenzyme A.<br>
4.Erythrose is used for synthesis of anthocyanin,
lignin and other aromatic compounds.<br>
5.It plays a role on fixation of \\(Co_2\\) in
photosynthesis through RUBP <br>               
`Summary` <br>
Respiration is a biological process in which
energy is released by breaking down of complex
organic substances into simple compounds. The
respiratory substrates may be carbohydrate,
protein or fats. Respiration is of two types,
aerobic (with \\(O_2\\) ) and anaerobic (without \\(O_2\\) ). All
plants, animals and most of the microbes derive
energy from aerobic respiration. Some bacteria
and fungi like yeast show anaerobic respiration.
Aerobic respiration consists of four stages and
they are glycolysis, link reaction, TCA cycle and
ETS. Glycolysis is the first stage which occurs
in cytosol and common for both aerobic and
anaerobic respiration and it involves breaking
down of glucose into two molecules of pyruvic
acid. Acetyl CoA formed from pyruvic acid, acts
as a link between glycolysis and Krebs cycle.
Krebs cycle takes place in matrix of mitochondria
and also called as citric acid cycle in which \\(Co_2\\)
and \\(H_2O\\) were produced. Hydrogen removed
from the substrates is received by coenzymes
which get reduced. They are again oxidised by
removal of hydrogen. This hydrogen splits into
protons and electrons. The electrons transferred
through various electron transport carriers
present in inner membrane of mitochondria is
used for the synthesis of ATP with the help of
ATP synthase. This process is called **oxidative phosphorylation.**
Anaerobic respiration involves incomplete
breaking down of the substrate glucose into
ethyl alcohol or lactic acid. In aerobic respiration
36 ATP molecules are produced in plant
mitochondria but in animals 38 ATP molecules
are produced per glucose molecule. During
anaerobic respiration only 2 ATP molecules are
produced, therefore anaerobic respiration is less
efficient than aerobic respiration. The respiratory
quotient (RQ) is the ratio of carbon dioxide
production to oxygen consumption and reflects
the relative contributions of fat, carbohydrate,
and protein to the oxidation. Pentose phosphate
pathway is an alternative pathway to glycolysis
and TCA cycle for oxidation of glucose. It occurs
in cytoplasm of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes <br>
