   **A Solution to pollution**<br>
 ![](/books/biology/unit-5/mineral-nutrition/00.png)<br>

A new solution has come up for high
nutrient pollution and eutrophication
in surface waters. Floating Treatment
Wetlands (FTWs) offer promising
solution and it is a built structure
which measures around 3,000 sq.ft
and comprises four layers: floatable
bamboo at base, styrofoam second layer,
a third layer of gunny bags with gravels
and final layer to support cleaning
agents (plants). Native plants including
Vetivers, Citronella, Tulsi and Withania
are being researched for use as cleaning
agents. FTW works on the principle of
Hydroponics which is explained in this
chapter. Microbes grown on the roots of
these plants break down and consume
organic matter in water and reduce
pollution.

plants with attractive leaves, flowers and
fruits.
Can you say all plants are healthy and
uniform in growth? Some plants are not
healthy and show symptoms like texture
changes, stunted growth, chlorosis, necrosis
and so on. Can you tell what is the reason
for all these symptoms? It may be due to
infection of microbial pathogens or climatic
factors or due to mineral deficiency.
In this chapter we are going to learn about
classification of minerals, their functions,
deficiency diseases and symptoms, nitrogen
metabolism and special modes of nutrition.
Further, how can these ideas help us to
improve productivity in agriculture?
Plants naturally obtain nutrients from
atmosphere, water and soil. Carbon,
hydrogen and oxygen are called as skeletal
elements and constitute about 94% of dry
weight. These elements play an important
role in the formation of organic compounds
such as carbohydrates, fats and protein. These
non-mineral elements are obtained from air
and water. Minerals are classified based on
essentiality. Arnon and Stout (1939) gave
criteria required for essential minerals:<br>
1. Elements necessary for growth and
development.
2. They should have direct role in the
metabolism of the plant.
3. It cannot be replaced by other elements.
4. Deficiency makes the plants impossible
to complete their vegetative and
reproductive phase.

#### 12.1 Classification of minerals <br>

#### 12.1.1 Classification of minerals based on

their quantity requirements
Essential elements are classified as
Macro-nutrients, Micronutrients and
Unclassified minerals based on their
requirements. Essential minerals which are
required in higher concentration are called
Macronutrients. Essential minerals which
are required in less concentration called are
as Micronutrients.
Minerals like Sodium, Silicon, Cobalt
and Selenium are not included in the list of
essential nutrients but are required by some
plants, these minerals are placed in the list
of unclassified minerals. These minerals
play specific roles for example, Silicon is
essential for pest resistance, prevent water
lodging and aids cell wall formation in
Equisetaceae (Equisetum), Cyperaceae and
Gramineae (Table 12. 1).
12.1.2 Classification of minerals based on
mobility
If you observe where the deficiency
symptoms appear first, you can notice
differences in old and younger leaves. It is
mainly due to mobility of minerals. Based
on this, they are classified into 1. Actively
mobile minerals and 2. Relatively immobile
minerals (Figure 12.1).
a. Actively mobile minerals
Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Magnesium,
Chlorine, Sodium, Zinc and Molybdenum.
Deficiency symptoms first appear on old
and senescent leaves due to active movement
of minerals to younger leaves.
b. Relatively immobile minerals
Calcium, Sulphur, Iron, Boron and Copper
shows deficiency symptoms first that appear

equal proportions.

{{</box>}}

#### 12.3 Functions, mode of absorption and deficiency symptoms of micronutrients <br>

Micronutrients even though required
in trace amounts are essential for the
metabolism of plants. They play key roles
in many plants. Example: Boron is essential

will study about the role of micro nutrients,
their functions, their mode of absorption,
deficiency symptoms and deficiency
diseases.<br>
**1.Iron (Fe):** Iron is required lesser

#### 12.5 Critical concentration and toxicity of minerals <br>

##### 12.5.1 Critical Concentration<br>

To increase the productivity and also to
avoid mineral toxicity knowledge of critical
concentration is essential. Mineral nutrients
lesser than critical concentration cause
deficiency symptoms. Increase of mineral
nutrients more than the normal concentration
causes toxicity. A concentration, at which
10 % of the dry weight of tissue is reduced,
is considered as toxic. Figure 12.2 explains
about Critical Concentration.<br>
![](books/biology/unit-5/mineral-nutrition/03.png)<br>
**Figure 12.2:** Critical Concentration

#### 12.5.2 Mineral Toxicity<br>

**a. Manganese toxicity**<br>
Increased Concentration of Manganese will
prevent the uptake of Fe and Mg, prevent
translocation of Ca to the shoot apex and
cause their deficiency. The symptoms of
manganese toxicity are appearance of brown
spots surrounded by chlorotic veins.<br>
**b. Aluminium Toxicity**
Aluminium toxicity causes precipitation
of nucleic acid, inhibition of ATPase,
inhibition of cell division and binding of
plasma membrane with Calmodulin.
For theories regarding, translocation of
minerals please refer Chapter- 11<br>

#### 12.6 Hydroponics and Aeroponics

**1. Hydroponics or Soilless culture: Von Sachs**
developed a method of growing plants in
nutrient solution. The commonly used
nutrient solutions are **Knop solution (1865)**
and **Arnon** and **Hoagland Solution (1940)**.
Later the term Hydroponics was coined by
**Goerick (1940)** and he also introduced
commercial techniques for hydroponics. In
hydroponics roots are immersed in the
solution containing nutrients and air is
supplied with help of tube (Figure 12.3).

![](books/biology/unit-5/mineral-nutrition/04.png)

**Aeroponics:** This technique was developed
by **Soifer Hillel** and **David Durger.** It is a
system where roots are suspended in air
and nutrients are sprayed over the roots by
a motor driven rotor (Figure 12.4).<br>
![](books/biology/unit-5/mineral-nutrition/05.png)<br>
**Figure 12.4:** Aeroponics

**12.7 Nitrogen Fixation**<br>
Inspiring act of nature is self-regulation.
As all living organisms act as tools for
biogeochemical cycles, nitrogen cycle is
highly regulated. Life on earth depends on
nitrogen cycle. Nitrogen occurs in atmosphere
in the form of \\(N_2\\) (N≡N), two nitrogen
atoms joined together by strong triple
covalent bonds. The process of converting
atmospheric nitrogen \\(N_2\\) into ammonia is
termed as nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation
can occur by two methods: 1. Biological;
2. ­­Non-Biological (Figure 12.5).<br>
![](books/biology/unit-5/mineral-nutrition/06.png)<br>
**Figure 12.5:** Nitrogen fixation

{{<box title="">}}
#### Activity <br>
Preparation of Solution Culture to find out
Mineral Deficiency
1.Take a glass jar or polythene bottle and
cover with black paper (to prevent algal
growth and roots reacting with light).<br>
2. Add nutrient solution.<br>
3. Fix a plant with the help of split cork.<br>
4. Fix a tube for aeration.<br>
5. Observe the growth by adding specific
minerals.<br>
{{</box>}}

#### 12.7.1 Non – Biological nitrogen fixation

• Nitrogen fixation by chemical process in
industry.
• Natural electrical discharge during
lightening fixes atmospheric nitrogen.

#### 12.7.2 Biological nitrogen fixation

Symbiotic bacterium like *Rhizobium* fixes
atmospheric
nitrogen.
Cyanobacteria
found in Lichens, *Anthoceros*, *Azolla* and
coralloid roots of *Cycas* also fix nitrogen.
Non-symbiotic (free living bacteria) like
*Clostridium* also fix nitrogen.

#### a. Symbiotic nitrogen fixation

**i. Nitrogen fixation with nodulation**
*Rhizobium* bacterium is found in leguminous
plants and fix atmospheric nitrogen. This kind
of symbiotic association is beneficial for both
the bacterium and plant. Root nodules are
formed due to bacterial infection. *Rhizobium*
enters into the host cell and proliferates, it
remains separated from the host cytoplasm
by a membrane (Figure 12.6).<br>
{{<box title="">}}
**Iron and Manganese toxicity**
Iron and Manganese exhibit competitive
behaviour. Deficiency of Fe and Mn shows
similar symptoms. Iron toxicity will affect
absorption of manganese. The possible reason
for iron toxicity is excess usage of chelated iron
in addition with increased acidity of soil (PH
less than 5.8) Iron and manganese toxicity will
be solved by using fertilizer with balanced
ratio of Fe and Mn.
{{</box>}}

#### Stages of Root nodule formation:<br>

1. Legume plants secretes phenolics which
attracts *Rhizobium.*<br>
2. *Rhizobium* reaches the rhizosphere and
enters into the root hair, infects the root
hair and leads to curling of root hairs.<br>
3. Infection thread grows inwards and
separates the infected tissue from normal
tissue.<br>
![](books/biology/unit-5/mineral-nutrition/07.png)> <br>
**Figure 12.6:** Rhizobium (Bacteroid) in root
nodule<br>
4. A membrane bound bacterium is formed
inside the nodule and is called **bacteroid.**<br>
5. Cytokinin from bacteria and auxin from
host plant promotes cell division and
leads to nodule formation<br>
{{<box title="">}}

#### Activity<br>
• Collect roots of legumes with root nodules.<br>
• Take cross section of the root nodule.<br>
• Observe under microscope. Discuss your
observations with your teacher.<br>
{{</box>}}

#### Non-Legume <br>
*Alnus* and *Casuarina*contain the bacterium
*Frankia*. *Psychotria*contains the bacterium
*Klebsiella.*<br>
**ii. Nitrogen fixation without nodulation**<br>
The following plants and prokaryotes are
involved in nitrogen fixation.<br>
Lichens  - *Anabaena* and *Nostoc*<br>
*Anthoceros* - *Nostoc*<br>
*Azolla*  - *Anabaena azollae*<br>
*Cycas* - *Anabaena* and *Nostoc*<br>
#### b. Non-symbiotic Nitrogen fixation
Free living bacteria and fungi also fix
atmospheric nitrogen.<br>

| Aerobic 	| Azotobacter, Beijerinckia <br>and Derxia 	|
|---	|---	|
| Anaerobic 	| Clostridium 	|
| Photosynthetic 	| Chlorobium and Rhodospirillum 	|
| Chemosynthetic 	| Disulfovibrio 	|
| Free living fungi 	| Yeast and Pullularia 	|
| Cyanobacteria 	| Nostoc, Anabaena and<br>Oscillatoria. 	|

#### 12.8 Nitrogen cycle and nitrogen metabolism

**12.8.1 Nitrogen cycle**

This cycle consists of following stages:
#### 1. Fixation of atmospheric nitrogen <br>
Di-nitrogen molecule from
the atmosphere progressively
gets reduced by addition of
a pair of hydrogen atoms.
Triple bond between two
nitrogen atoms (N≡N) are
cleaved to produce ammonia (Figure 12.7).
Nitrogen fixation process requires
Nitrogenase enzyme complex, Minerals
(Mo, Fe and S), anaerobic condition, ATP,
electron and glucose 6 phosphate as H 1
donor. Nitrogenase enzyme is active only
in anaerobic condition. To create this
anaerobic condition a pigment known
as **leghaemoglobin**is synthesized in the
nodules which acts as oxygen scavenger and
removes the oxygen. Nitrogen fixing bacteria
in root nodules appears pinkish due to the
presence of this leghaemoglobin pigment.<br>
Overall equation:<br>
N_2 + 8e- + 8H+  + 16ATP -----> 2NH + H_2 + 16ADP + 16 Pi 

![](books/biology/unit-5/mineral-nutrition/08.png)<br>
**Figure 12.7:** Nitrogenase enzyme function <br>
#### 2. Nitrification
Ammonia (NH3+ ) is converted into Nitrite
(NO2 - ) by Nitrosomonas bacterium. Nitrite
is then converted into Nitrate (NO3 - ) by
*Nitrobacter* bacterium.
Plants are more adapted to absorb nitrate
(NO3 - ) than ammonium ions from the soil.<br>

2NH3+  + 3 O2 ------Nitrosomonas----> 2NO2- +2H+  +2H2O 

2NO2- + o2 ----Nitrobacter------> 2NO3-

#### 3. Nitrate Assimilation
The process by which nitrate is reduced to
ammonia is called **nitrate assimilation** and
occurs during nitrogen cycle.

![](books/biology/unit-5/mineral-nutrition/09.png)

#### 4. Ammonification
Decomposition of organic nitrogen (proteins
and amino acids) from dead plants and animals
into ammonia is called **ammonification.**
Organisim involved in this process are *Bacillus*
*ramosus* and *Bacillus vulgaris*.

#### 5. Denitrification
Nitrates in the soil are converted back into
atmospheric nitrogen by a process called
**denitrification**. Bacteria involved in this
process are Pseudomonas, Thiobacillus and
Bacillus subtilis.<br>
Nitrate  -----Pseudomonas-----> Molecular Nitrogen<br>
(NO 3 -)                            (N 2 )

![](books/biology/unit-5/mineral-nutrition/10.png)<br>
**Figure 12.8:** Nitrogen Cycle

#### 12.8.2 Nitrogen Metabolism Ammonium Assimilation (Fate of Ammonia)
Ammonia is converted into amino acids by
the following processes:<br>
#### 1. Reductive amination

Glutamic acid or glutamate is formed by
reaction of ammonia with α-ketoglutaric acid

![](books/biology/unit-5/mineral-nutrition/11.png)<br>

#### 2. Transamination
Transfer of amino group (NH 3 +) from glutamic
acid (glutamate) to keto group of keto acid.
Glutamic acid is the main amino acid from
which other amino acids are synthesised by
transamination. Transamination requires
the enzyme transaminase and co enzyme
pyridoxal phosphate (derivative of vitamin
B6 -pyridoxine<br>
![](books/biology/unit-5/mineral-nutrition/12.png)

#### 3. Catalytic Amination:(GS/GOGAT Pathway)
Glutamate amino acid combines with
ammonia to form the amide glutamine.<br>
![](books/biology/unit-5/mineral-nutrition/13.png)<br>

Glutamine reacts with α ketoglutaric acid to
form two molecules of glutamate.<br>
![](books/biology/unit-5/mineral-nutrition/14.png)<br>
(GOGAT- Glutamine-2-Oxoglutarate
a ­ minotransferase)

#### 12.9 Special modes of nutrition
Nutrition is the process of uptake and
utilization of nutrients by living organisms.
There are two main types such as **autotrophic**
and **heterotrophic** nutrition. Autotrophic
nutrition is further divided into **photosynthetic**
and **chemosynthetic** nutrition. Heterotrophic
nutrition is further divided into saprophytic,
parasitic, symbiotic and insectivorous type. In
this topic you are going to learn about special
mode of nutrition.

#### 12.9.1 Saprophytic mode of nutrition in angiosperms
Saprophytes derive nutrients from dead and
decaying matter. Bacteria and fungus are main
saprophytic organisms. Some angiosperms
also follow saprophytic mode of nutrition.
Example: *Neottia*. Roots of *Neottia* (Bird’s
Nest Orchid) associate with mycorrhizae and
absorb nutrients as a saprophyte. *Monotropa*
(Indian Pipe) grow on humus rich soil found
in thick forests. It absorbs nutrient through
mycorrhizal association (Figure 12.9).

![](books/biology/unit-5/mineral-nutrition/15.png)<br>
**Figure 12.9:** Saprophytic Mode of nutrition

#### 12.9.2 Parasitic mode of nutrition in angiosperms
Organisms deriving their nutrient from
another organism (host) and causing disease
to the host are called parasites.<br>
**a. Obligate or Total parasite -** Completely
depends on host for their survival and
produces haustoria.<br>
**i.Total stem parasite:** The leafless stem
twine around the host and produce
haustoria. Example: *Cuscuta* (Dodder),
a rootless plant growing on *Zizyphus*,
*Citrus *and so on.<br>
**ii.Total root parasite:** They do not have
stem axis and grow in the roots of host
plants produce haustoria. Example:
*Rafflesia, Orobanche and Balanophora*.<br>
**b.Partial parasite -** Plants of this group
contain chlorophyll and synthesize
carbohydrates. Water and mineral
requirements are dependent on host plant.<br>
**i.Partial Stem Parasite:** Example:
*Loranthus* and *Viscum* (Mistletoe)
*Loranthus* grows on fig and mango trees
and absorb water and minerals from xylem.<br>
**ii.Partial root parasite:** Example: *Santalum*
*album* (Sandal wood tree) in its juvenile
stage produces haustoria which grows
on roots of many plants (Figure 12.10).<br>
![](books/biology/unit-5/mineral-nutrition/16.png)<br>
**Figure 12.10:** Parasitic Mode of Nutrition

#### 12.9.3 Symbiotic mode of Nutrition

**a.Lichens:** It is a mutual association of
Algae and Fungi. Algae prepares food and
fungi absorbs water and provides thallus
structure.<br>
**b.Mycorrhizae:** Fungi associated with roots
of higher plants including Gymnosperms.<br>
Example: Pinus.<br>
**c.*Rhizobium*and Legumes:** This symbiotic
association fixes atmospheric nitrogen<br>
**d.Cyanobacteria and Coralloid Roots:**
This association is found in Cycas where
Nostoc associates with its coralloid roots.
(Figure 12.11).<br>
![](books/biology/unit-5/mineral-nutrition/17.png)<br>
**Figure 12.11:** Symbiotic mode of nutrition

#### 12.9.4 Insectivorous mode of nutrition
Plants which are growing in nitrogen
deficient areas develop insectivorous habit
to resolve nitrogen deficiency. These plants
obtain nitrogen from the insects
**a.Nepenthes**(Pitcher plant): Pitcher is
a modified leaf and contains digestive
enzymes. Rim of the pitcher is provided
with nectar glands and acts as an attractive
lid. When insect is trapped, proteolytic
enzymes will digest the insect.<br>
**b.Drosera (Sundew):** It consists of long club
shaped leaves with tentacles that secrete
sticky digestive fluid which looks like a
sundew and attracts insects.<br>
**c.Utricularia (Bladder wort):** Submerged
plant in which leaf is modified into a
bladder to collect insect in water.<br>
**d.Dionaea** (Venus fly trap): Leaf of this plant
modified into a colourful trap. Two folds
of lamina consist of sensitive trigger hairs
and when insects touch the hairs it will
close and traps the insects.(Figure 12.12).<br>

**Summary** <br>
Sources of minerals for plants are atmosphere,
water and soil. Minerals are classified based on their
quantity, mobility and functions. Macro nutrients
(C, H, O, N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S) are required in
higher concentration and micro nutrients (Fe,
Mn, Cu, Zn, B, Mo, Cl and Ni) are required in
lesser concentration. Minerals like Sodium,
Cobalt, Silicon and Selenium are required by some
plants for specific functions and such minerals
are grouped as unclassified minerals. Actively
mobile elements are N, P, K, Mg, Cl, Na, Zn and
Mo. The deficiency symptoms for these minerals
first appear on old and senescent leaves due to
active movement of minerals to younger leaves.
Relatively immobile elements are Ca, S, Fe, B and
Cu. In such minerals, deficiency symptoms first
appear on young leaves due to immobile nature.
Minerals and their deficiency symptoms include
chlorosis (loss of chlorophyll pigments), necrosis
(death of tissue), anthocyanin formation, die back
of shoot, exanthema, hooked leaf tip, whiptail and
so on. A concentration at which 10% of dry weight
is reduced is considered as critical concentration.
Minerals used in excess concentration become
toxic.
Soil less cultivation alleviates problems due to
mineral deficiency. It includes hydroponics and
aeroponics. Hydroponics is a method of growing
plants in a nutrient solution. Aeroponics is the
technique in which roots are suspended in air and
nutrient sprayed over the roots by motor driven
rotor. Nitrogen is an important requirement
for normal growth and functioning of a plant.
Nitrogen fixing organisms fix nitrogen from
atmosphere naturally through symbiotic and non-
symbiotic modes. Special modes of nutrition are
seen in plant which grew in nutrient deficient soils
and the character becomes permanent.<br>
