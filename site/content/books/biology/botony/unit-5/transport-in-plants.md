Over 450 million years ago (the
Ordovician period in Paleozoic era) plants
migrated from their own sophisticated
water world to newly formed land. The land
had harsh environment; water availability
was deeper and so plants struggled for
getting water for their very existence. Some
of them failed to survive and rest adopted
themselves to the new world. The biggest
adaptations followed for their survival was
building their own water absorbing systems
to draw water from deep inside the land. The
creation and updating of water absorbing
system (vascular tissues) led to the diversity
of the plant kingdom. The gregarious growth
of prehistoric pteridophytes, gymnosperms
and present-day flowering plants led to the
biggest challenge in the transport of water
from root to several meters high trees
against gravity. In this chapter, we will study
the events taking place between the gain
of water in roots and loss in leaves and the
mechanisms behind the basic physical and
biological processes in the movement of
water, gases and minerals in plants. Further,
we study how food material synthesized
in the leaf can be transported to various
utilizing and storage areas against struggles
and challenges.

#### 11.1 Types of Transport

Transport is the process of moving water,
minerals and food to all parts of the plant
body. Conducting tissues such as xylem and
phloem play an important role in this.
What is the need for transport? Water
absorbed from roots must travel up to
leaves by xylem for food preparation by
photosynthesis. Likewise, food prepared
from leaves has to travel to all parts of the
plant including roots. Both the processes are
interconnected and depend on each other.
 Based on the distance travelled by water
(sap) or food (solute) they are classified as
(a) Short distance (Cell to cell transport)
and (b) Long distance transport.

{{<box title="The Plumbing system of Plants and Humans">}}

![Plumbing system of Human](books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/02.png)

Plants and animals
evolved separately but   developed
c o m p a r a b l e
structures to control
transport of water
and dissolved
chemicals. But whose
transport system is
optimally designed
to offer selective
advantage? In plants,
transport through xylem has allowed
growth in height and colonization of diverse
habitats and the system has to be extensive
as Photosynthesis requires water. Murray’s
law predicts the thickness of branches in
transport networks, such that the cost for
transport and maintenance of the transport
medium is minimized. This law is observed
in the vascular and respiratory systems of
animals, xylem in plants, and the respiratory
system of insects. Further research in this
area will improve our understanding of
natural world.

**i. Short-distance (Cell to cell transport):**
Involvement of few cells, mostly in the
lateral direction. They are the connecting
link to xylem and phloem from root hairs
or leaf tissues respectively. Examples:
Diffusion, Imbibition, and Osmosis.<br>

**ii. Long-distance transport: Transport**
within the network of xylem or
phloem is an example for long-distance
transport.
**Examples:** Ascent of Sap and
Translocation
of Solutes. <br>

 Based on energy expenditure during
transport, they are classified as **(a) passive transport and**
**(b) active transport.** <br>

**i. Passive transport:** It is a downhill process
which utilizes physical forces
like gravity
and concentration. No energy
expenditure
is required. It includes
diffusion, facilitated
diffusion, imbibition, and osmosis.

**ii. Active transport:** It is a biological
process
and it runs based on the energy
obtained
from respiration. It is an uphill process.

#### 11.2 Cell to Cell Transport

Cell to cell or short distance transport covers
the limited area and consists of few cells. They
are the facilitators or tributaries to the longdistance
transport. The driving force for the
cell to cell transport can be passive or active
**(Figure 11.1)**. The following chart illustrate
the various types of cell to cell transport:

![cell to cell transport](/books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/03.png)

##### 11.2.1 Passive Transport

1. **Diffusion**
When we expose a lightened incense stick
or mosquito coil or open a perfume bottle
in a closed room, we can smell the odour
everywhere in the room. This is due to the even
distribution of perfume molecules throughout
the room. This process is called **diffusion**.
In **diffusion**, the movement of molecules
is continuous and random in order in all
directions **(Figure 11.2)**.

![Distributionofmoleculesindiffusion,Initialstage](/books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/04.png)

{{<box title="Diffusion:">}}
The net movement of molecules
from a region of their higher concentration
to a region of their lower concentration
along a concentration gradient until an
equilibrium is attained.
{{</box>}}

#### Characteristics of diffusion

i. It is a passive process, hence no energy
expenditure involved.<br>
ii. It is independent of the living system.<br>
iii. Diffusion is obvious in gases and liquids.<br>
iv. Diffusion is rapid over a shorter
distance but extremely slow over a
longer distance.<br>
v. The rate of diffusion is determined by
temperature, concentration gradient and
relative density.<br>

#### Significance of diffusion in Plants

i. Gaseous exchange of O2 and CO2
between the atmosphere and stomata
of leaves takes place by the process
of diffusion. O2 is absorbed during
respiration and CO2 is absorbed during
photosynthesis.<br>
ii. In transpiration, water vapour from
intercellular spaces diffuses into
atmosphere through stomata by the
process of diffusion.<br>
iii. The transport of ions in mineral salts
during passive absorption also takes place
by this process.<br>

{{<box title="Do you know">}}

Surgical theatres must be
free from germs to prevent
infection during surgeries. A mixture of
Formalin and Potassium permanganate
produces enormous fumes which will kill all
pathogens in an enclosed area. This method
is known as fumigation and operates by
diffusion.
{{</box>}}

**2. Facilitated Diffusion**
Cell membranes allow water and nonpolar
molecules to permeate by simple diffusion.
For transporting polar molecules such as
ions, sugars, amino acids, nucleotides and
many cell metabolites is not merely based on
concentration gradient. It depends on,
**i. Size of molecule:** Smaller molecules
diffuse faster.<br>
**ii. Solubility of the molecule:** Lipid soluble
substances easily and rapidly pass
through the membrane. But water soluble
substances are difficult to pass through
the membrane. They must be facilitated
to pass the membrane.

{{<box title="Types of Membrane Permeability">}}

A solution is made up of solute particles
dissolved in a solvent and the permeability
of the above components depends on the
nature of cell membranes, which is given
below:
**Impermeable:** Inhibit the movement
of both solvent and solute molecules.
Example: Suberised, cutinised or liginifid
cell walls.
**Permeable:** They allow diffusion of
both solvent and solute molecules through
them.**Example:** Cellulosic cell wall.
**Semi permeable:** Semi permeable
allow diffusion of solvent molecule
but do not allow the passage of solute
molecule. **Example:** Parchment paper.
**Selectively permeable:** All bio
membranes allow some solutes to pass
in addition to the solvent molecules.
**Example:** Plasmalemma, tonoplast, and
membranes of cell organelles.
{{</box>}}<br>
In facilitated diffusion, molecules cross
the cell membrane with the help of special
membrane proteins called transport proteins,
without the expenditure of ATP.
There are two types of transport proteins
present in the cell membrane. They are
channel protein and a carrier protein.

##### I. Channel Protein

Channel protein forms a channel or tunnel
in the cell membrane for the easy passage of
molecules to enter the cell. The channels are
either open or remain closed. They may open
up for specific molecules. Some channel
proteins create larger pores in the outer
membrane. **Examples:** Porin and Aquaporin.<br>
**i. Porin**
Porin is a large transporter protein found in
the outer membrane of plastids, mitochondria
and bacteria which facilitates smaller
molecules to pass through the membrane.<br>
**ii. Aquaporin**
Aquaporin is a water channel protein embedded
in the plasma membrane. It regulates the
massive amount of water transport across
the membrane (Figure 11.3). Plants contain
a variety of aquaporins. Over 30 types of
aquaporins are known from maize. Currently,

they are also recognized to transport substrates
like glycerol, urea, CO2, NH3, metalloids, and
**Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)** in addition
to water. They increase the permeability of the
membrane to water. They confer drought and
salt stress tolerance.<br>
![Aquaporin](/books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/05.png)

##### II. Carrier Protein

Carrier protein acts as a vehicle to carry
molecules from outside of the membrane to
inside the cell and vice versa (Figure 11.4). Due
to association with molecules to be transported,
the structure of carrier protein gets modified
until the dissociation of the molecules.

![CarrierProtien](/books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/06.png)

There are 3 types of carrier proteins classified
on the basis of handling of molecules and
direction of transport (Figure 11.5). They are,
i) **Uniport** ii) **Symport** iii) **Antiport.**
![Directionoftransport](/books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/07.png)

**i. <em>Uniport</em>:** In this molecule of a single type
move across a membrane independent of
other molecules in one direction.<br>
**ii. <em>Symport or co-transport</em>:** The term
symport is used to denote an integral
membrane protein that simultaneously
transports two types of molecules across
the membrane in the same direction.<br>
**iii. <em>Antiport or Counter Transport</em>:** An
antiport is an integral membrane
transport protein that simultaneously
transports two different molecules,
in opposite directions, across the
membrane.

#### 11.2.2 Active Transport

The main disadvantage of passive transport
processes like diffusion is the lack of control
over the transport of selective molecules. There
is a possibility of harmful substances entering
the cell by a concentration gradient in the
diffusion process. But selective permeability of
cell membrane has a great control over entry and
exit of molecules. Active transport is the entry
of molecules against a concentration gradient
and an uphill process and it needs energy which
comes from ATP. Passive transport uses kinetic
energy of molecules moving down a gradient
whereas, active transport uses cellular energy
to move them against a gradient. The transport
proteins discussed in facilitated diffusion can
also transport ions or molecules against a
concentration gradient with the expenditure of
cellular energy as an active process. Pumps use
a source of free energy such as ATP or light to
drive the thermodynamically uphill transport
of ions or molecules. The pump action is
an example of active transport. Example:
Na + -K + -ATPase pump (Table 11.1).

#### 11.3 Plant Water Relations

Water plays an essential role in the life of the
plant. The availability of water influences the
external and internal structures of plants as
protoplasm is made of 60-80% water. Water is a
**universal solvent** since most of the substances
get dissolved in it and the high tensile strength
of water molecule is helpful in the ascent of sap.
Water maintains the internal temperature of
the plant as well as the turgidity of the cell.

#### 1.3.1 Imbibition

Colloidal systems such as **gum, starch,**
**proteins, cellulose, agar, gelatin** when placed
in water, will absorb a large volume of water and
swell up. These substances are called **imbibants**
and the phenomenon is i**imbibition.**
**Examples:** 1. The swelling of dry seeds
2.The swelling of wooden windows, tables, doors
due to high humidity during the rainy season.

{{<box title="">}}
**The Power of Imbibition**
In olden days, small wooden
pegs were inserted into
crevices of rocks followed by
continuous hydration. Due to imbibition
the volume of wooden peg increases and
cuts off rocks precisely.

**///create Box**
{{</box>}}

**Significance of imbibition**

i. During germination of seeds, imbibition
increases the volume of seed enormously
and leads to bursting of the seed coat.
ii. It helps in the absorption of water by roots
at the initial level.

#### 11.3.2 Water Potential (Ψ)

The concept of water potential
was introduced in 1960 by
**Slatyer and Taylor**. Water
potential is potential energy
of water in a system compared
to pure water when both temperature and
pressure are kept the same. It is also a measure
of how freely water molecules can move in
a particular environment or system. Water
potential is denoted by the Greek symbol **Ψ**
(psi) and measured in **Pascal (Pa)**. At standard
temperature, the water potential of pure water is
**zero.** Addition of solute to pure water decreases
the kinetic energy thereby decreasing the water
potential. Comparatively a solution always
has low water potential than pure water. In a
group of cells with different water potential, a
water potential gradient is generated. Water
will move from higher water potential to lower
water potential.
Water potential **(Ψ)** can be determined by,

1. Solute concentration or Solute ­potential
**(Ψ S)**
2. Pressure potential **(Ψ P )**
By correlating two factors, water potential is
written as,

{{<box title="" >}}
         Ψ W = Ψ S + Ψ P
Water Potential = Solute potential +
Pressure potential

{{</box>}}

**1. Solute Potential (Ψ S )**
Solute potential, otherwise known as **osmotic**
**potential** denotes the effect of dissolved solute
on water potential. In pure water, the addition
of solute reduces its free energy and lowers the
water potential value from zero to negative.
Thus the value of solute potential is always
negative. In a solution at standard atmospheric
pressure, water potential is always equal to
solute potential (Ψ W = Ψ S ).
**2. Pressure Potential (Ψ P )**

Pressure potential is a mechanical force working
against the effect of solute potential. Increased
pressure potential will increase water potential
and water enters cell and cells become
This **positive hydrostatic pressure** within
the cell is called **Turgor pressure.** Likewise,
withdrawal of water from the cell decreases the
water potential and the cell becomes **flaccid.**
**3. Matric Potential (Ψ M )**

Matric potential represents the attraction
between water and the **hydrating colloid
or gel-like organic molecules in the cell
wall** which is collectively termed as **matric
potential.** Matric potential is also known as
**imbibition pressure.** The matric potential
is maximum (most negative value) in a dry
material.**Example:** The swelling of soaked
seeds in water.

#### 11.3.3 Osmotic Pressure and Osmotic Pressure

When a solution and its solvent (pure water)
are separated by a semipermeable membrane,
a pressure is developed in the solution, due to
the presence of dissolved solutes. This is called
**osmotic pressure (OP)**. Osmotic pressure
is increased with the increase of dissolved
solutes in the solution. More concentrated
solution (low **Ψ** or Hypertonic) has high
osmotic pressure. Similarly, less concentrated
solution (high **Ψ** or Hypotonic) has low
osmotic pressure. The osmotic pressure of
pure water is always **zero** and it increases
with the increase of solute concentration.
Thus **osmotic pressure** always has a positive
value and it is represented as π.
Osmotic potential is defined as the ratio
between the number of solute particles and
the number of solvent particles in a solution.
Osmotic potential and osmotic pressure are
numerically equal. Osmotic potential has a
negative value whereas on the other hand
osmotic pressure has a positive value.

#### 11.3.4 Turgor Pressure and Wall Pressure

­
When a plant cell is placed in pure water
(hypotonic solution) the diffusion of water into
the cell takes place by endosmosis. It creates a
positive hydrostatic pressure on the rigid cell
wall by the cell membrane. Henceforth the
pressure exerted by the cell membrane towards
the cell wall is **Turgor Pressure (TP).**
The cell wall reacts to this turgor pressure
with **equal and opposite force,** and the
counter-pressure exerted by the cell wall
towards cell membrane is **wall pressure (WP)**.
Turgor pressure and wall pressure make
the cell fully turgid.
**TP + WP = Turgid.**

{{<box title="">}}

##### Activity

Find the role of turgor pressure in
sudden closing of leaves when we
touch the ‘touch me not’ plant.
{{</box>}}

#### 11.3.5 Diffusion Pressure Deficit (DPD) or Suction Pressure (SP)

Pure solvent (hypotonic) has higher diffusion
pressure. Addition of solute in pure solvent
lowers its diffusion pressure. The difference
between the diffusion pressure of the solution
and its solvent at a particular temperature and
atmospheric pressure is called as **Diffusion
Pressure Deficit (DPD)** termed by **Meyer
(1938)**. DPD is increased by the addition of
solute into a solvent system. Increased DPD
favours endosmosis or it sucks the water from
hypotonic solution; hence **Renner** (1935)
called it as **Suction pressure**. It is equal to
the difference of osmotic pressure and turgor
pressure of a cell. The following three situations
are seen in plants:
• **DPD in normal cell**: DPD = OP – TP.
• **DPD in fully turgid cell**: Osmotic pressure
is always equal to turgor pressure in a fully
turgid cell.
• **OP = TP or OP-TP =0**. Hence DPD of fully
turgid cell is zero.
• **DPD in flaccid cell**: If the cell is in flaccid
condition there is no turgor pressure or
TP=0. Hence DPD = OP.

#### 11.3.6 Osmosis

Osmosis (Latin: Osmos-impulse, urge) is a
**special type of diffusion**. It represents the
movement of **water or solvent molecules**
through a selectively permeable membrane
**from the place of its higher concentration
(high water potential) to the place of its lower
concentration (low water potential).**

Types of Solutions based on concentration
**i. Hypertonic** (Hyper = High; tonic = solute):
This is a strong solution (low solvent/ high
solute / low **Ψ**) which **attracts solvent**
from other solutions.

**ii. Hypotonic** (Hypo = low; tonic = s ­ olute):
This is a weak solution (high solvent /low
or zero solute / high **Ψ**) and it out to other solutions **(­Figure 11.7)**.

**iii. Isotonic** (Iso = identical; tonic = soute):
It refers to two solutions having same
concentration. In this condition the net
movement of water molecule will be zero.
The term hyper, hypo and isotonic are
**relative terms**which can be used only in
comparison with another solution.

 **Figure 11.6: Thistle Funnel Experiment**

 Mouth of a thistle funnel is tied with
goat bladder. It acts as a semipermeable
membrane. Pour concentrated sugar
solution in the thistle funnel and mark
the level of solution. Place this in a beaker
of water. After some time, water level in
the funnel rises up steadily. This is due to
the inward diffusion of water molecules
through the semipermeable membrane
(Figure 11.6).
Conversely, if water in the beaker is
replaced by a sugar solution and sugar
solution in the thistle funnel replaced by
water, what will be happen?

**4. Reverse Osmosis**
Reverse Osmosis follows the same principles
of osmosis, but in the reverse direction. In
this process movement of water is reversed by
applying pressure to force the water against a
concentration gradient of the solution. In regular
osmosis, the water molecules move from the
higher concentration (pure water = hypotonic)
to lower concentration (salt water = hypertonic).
But in reverse osmosis, the water molecules
move from the lower concentration (salt water =
hypertonic) to higher concentration (pure water
= hypotonic) through a selectively permeable
membrane (Figure 11.9).

#### 11.4 Absorption of Water

Terrestrial plants have to absorb water from
the soil to maintain turgidity, metabolic
activities and growth. Absorption of water
from soil takes place in two steps:

1. From soil to root hairs – either actively
or passively.
2. From root hairs further transport in
the lateral direction to reach xylem, the
superhighway of water transport.

#### 11.4.1 Water Absorbing Organs

Usually, absorption of water occurs in plants
through young roots. The zone of rapid water
absorption is **root hairs**. They are delicate
structures which get continuously replaced
by new ones. Root hairs are unicellular
extensions of epidermal cells without cuticle.
Root hairs are extremely thin and numerous
and they provide a large surface area for
absorption (Figure 11.10).

![](/books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/13.png)<br>
**Figure 11.10:** Structure of Root Hair

#### 11.4.2 Path of Water Across Root Cells

Water is first absorbed by root hair and other
epidermal cells through imbibition from soil
and moves radially and centripetally across
the cortex, endodermis, pericycle and finally
reaches xylem elements osmotically.
There are three possible routes of
water (Figure 11.11). They are **i) Apoplast**
**ii) Symplast** **iii) Transmembrane route**.
**1. Apoplast**
The **apoplast** (Greek: **apo** = away;
**plast**= cell) consists of everything external

![](/books/biology/unit-5/1transports-in-plants/14.png)<br>
  **Figure 11.11:** Path of water across root cells

to the plasma membrane of the living cell.
The apoplast includes cell walls, extra cellular
spaces and the interior of dead cells such as
vessel elements and tracheids. In the apoplast
pathway, water moves exclusively through the
cell wall or the non-living part of the plant
without crossing any membrane. The apoplast
is a continuous system.
**2. Symplast**

The **symplast**(Greek: **sym**= within; **plast** =
cell) consists of the entire mass of cytosol
of all the living cells in a plant, as well as the
**plasmodesmata**, the cytoplasmic channel that
interconnects them.
In the symplastic route, water has to cross
plasma membrane to enter the cytoplasm
of outer root cell; then it will move within
adjoining cytoplasm through plasmodesmata
around the vacuoles without the necessity to
cross more membrane, till it reaches xylem.
**3. Transmembrane route**

In transmembrane pathway water sequentially
enters a cell on one side and exits from the
cell on the other side. In this pathway, water
crosses at least two membranes for each cell.
Transport across the **tonoplast** is also
involved.

#### 11.4.3 Mechanism of Water Absorption

**Kramer (1949)** recognized two distinct
mechanisms which independently operate in
the absorption of water in plants. They are, i)
active absorption ii) passive absorption.
**1. Active Absorption**

The mechanism of water absorption due to
forces generated in the root itself is called **active
absorption**. Active absorption may be osmotic
or non-osmotic.

![](/books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/15.png)<br>

**i. Osmotic active absorption**

The theory of osmotic active absorption
was postulated by **Atkins (1916)** and **Preistley**
(1923). According to this theory, the first step
in the absorption is soil water imbibed by
cell wall of the root hair followed by osmosis.
The soil water is hypotonic and cell sap is
hypertonic. Therefore, soil water diffuses into
root hair along the concentration gradient
(endosmosis). When the root hair becomes
fully turgid, it becomes hypotonic and water
moves osmotically to the outer most cortical
cell. In the same way, water enters into inner
cortex, endodermis, pericycle and finally
reaches protoxylem. As the sap reaches the
protoxylem a pressure is developed known
as **root pressure**. This theory involves the
symplastic movement of water.
**Objections to osmotic theory:**

1.The cell sap concentration in xylem is not always high.
2. Root pressure is not universal in all plants
especially in trees.

**ii. Non-Osmotic active absorption**
**Bennet-Clark (1936)**, **Thimann** (1951) and
**Kramer**(1959) observed absorption of water
even if the concentration of cell sap in the root
hair is lower than that of the soil water. Such a
movement requires an expenditure of energy
released by respiration (ATP). Thus, there is a
link between water absorption and respiration.
It is evident from the fact that when respiratory
inhibitors like KCN, Chloroform are applied
there is a decrease in the rate of respiration and
also the rate of absorption of water.
**2. Passive Absorption**

In passive absorption, roots do not play any
role in the absorption of water and is regulated
by transpiration only. Due to transpiration,
water is lost from leaf cells along with a drop
in turgor pressure. It increases DPD in leaf
cells and leads to withdrawal of water from
adjacent xylem cells. In xylem, a tension is
developed and is transmitted downward up to
root resulting in the absorption of water from
the soil.
In passive absorption (Table 11.3), the
path of water may be symplastic or apoplastic.
It accounts for about 98% of the total water
uptake by plants.

| Table: 11.3     Differences between Active<br>     Absorption and Passive Absorption   |   |
|---------|------------ |
|         Active<br>    Absorption  |         Passive <br>     Absorption  |
| Active absorption <br>takes place by the <br>activity of root and root hairs  | The pressure for<br>absorption is notdeveloped in <br>rootsand <br>hence roots play<br>passive role  |
| Transpiration has no effect on active<br>absorption  | Absorption regulated<br>by transpiration  |
| The root hairs<br>have high DPD<br>as compared to<br>soil solution and<br>therefore water is<br>taken by tension  | The absorption<br>occurs due to tension<br>created in xylem sap<br>by transpiration pull,thus water <br>is sucked in by tension  |
| Respiratory energy needed  | Respiratory energy not required  |
| It involves symplastic<br>movement of water  | Both symplast and apoplast movement of<br>water involved  |

#### 11.5 Ascent of Sap

In the last chapter, we studied about water
absorption from roots to xylem in a lateral
direction and here we will learn about the
mechanism of distribution of water inside the
plant. Like tributaries join together to form a
river, millions of root hairs conduct a small
amount of water and confluence in xylem, the
superhighway of water conduction. Xylem
handles a large amount of water to conduct
to many parts in an upward direction.
The water within the xylem along with
dissolved minerals from roots is called **sap** and
its upward transport is called **ascent of sap**.

#### 11.5.1 The Path of Ascent of Sap

There is no doubt; water travels up along the
vascular tissue. But vascular tissue has two
components namely Xylem and Phloem. Of
these two, which is responsible for the ascent
of sap? The following experiment will prove
that xylem is the only element through which
water moves up.

![](/books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/17.png)<br>
**Figure 11.12:** Balsam plant and eosin
dye experiment

Cut a branch of balsam plant and place it
in a beaker containing **eosin** (red colour dye)
water. After some time, a red streak appears on
the stem indicating the ascent of water. Remove
the plant from water and cut a transverse
section of the stem and observe it under the
microscope. Only xylem element is coloured
red, which indicates the path of water is xylem.
Phloem is not colored indicating that it has no
role in the ascent of sap (Figure 11.12).

**Mechanism of Ascent of Sap**

In ascent of sap, the biggest challenge is the
force required to lift the water to the top of
the tallest trees. A number of theories have
been put forward to explain the mechanism
of the ascent of sap. They are, A. Vital force
theories, B. Root pressure theory, and C.
Physical force theory.

#### 11.5.2 Vital Force Theories

According to vital force theories, living cells
are mandatory for the ascent of sap. Based on
this the following two theories derived:
**1. Relay pump theory of Godlewski (1884)**
Periodic changes in osmotic pressure of living
cells of the xylem parenchyma and medullary
ray act as a pump for the movement of water.
**2. Pulsation theory of J.C.Bose (1923)**
Bose invented an instrument called
**Crescograph,** which consists of an electric
probe connected to a galvanometer
(Figure 11.13). When a probe is inserted into
the inner cortex of the stem, the galvanometer
showed high electrical activity. Bose believed
a rhythmic pulsating movement of inner
cortex like a pump (similar to the beating
of the heart) is responsible for the ascent of
sap. He concluded that cells associated with
xylem exhibit pumping action and pumps
the sap laterally into xylem cells.

![](/books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/18.png)<br>
**Figure 11.13:** J. C. Bose

**Objections to vital force theories**

**i. Strasburger** (1889) and **Overton**(1911)
experimentally proved that living cells are
not mandatory for the ascent of sap. For this,
he selected an old oak tree trunk which when
immersed in **picric acid** and subjected to
excessive heat killed all the living cells of the
trunk. The trunk when dipped in water, the
ascent of sap took place.
ii. Pumping action of living cells should be
in between two xylem elements (vertically)
and not on lateral sides.

#### 11.5.3 Root Pressure Theory

If a plant which is watered well is cut a few
inches above the ground level, sap exudes out
with some force. This is called **sap exudation**
or **bleeding**. **Stephen Hales**, father of plant
physiology observed this phenomenon and
coined the term **‘Root Pressure’. Stoking**
(1956) defined root pressure as “a pressure
developing in the tracheary elements of the
xylem as a result of metabolic activities of the
root”. But the following objections have been
raised against root pressure theory:
i. Root pressure is totally absent in
gymnosperms, which includes some of the
tallest plants.
ii. There is no relationship between the
ascent of sap and root pressure. For example,
in summer, the rate of the ascent of sap is
more due to transpiration in spite of the fact
that root pressure is very low. On the other
hand, in winter when the rate of ascent of sap
is low, a high root pressure is found.
iii. Ascent of sap continues even in the
absence of roots
iv. The magnitude of root pressure is
about 2atm, which can raise the water level
up to few feet only, whereas the tallest trees
are more than 100m high.

#### 11.5.4 Physical Force Theory

Physical force theories suggest that ascent of
sap takes place through the dead xylem vessel
and the mechanism is entirely physical and
living cells are not involved.

![](/books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/19.png)<br>

**1.Capillary theory**

**Boehm (1809)** suggested that the xylem
vessels work like a capillary tube. This
capillarity of the vessels under normal
atmospheric pressure is responsible for
the ascent of sap. This theory was rejected
because the magnitude of capillary force can
raise water level only up to a certain height.
Further, the xylem vessels are broader than
the tracheid which actually conducts more
water and against the capillary theory.
**2. Imbibition theory**

This theory was first proposed by **Unger
(1876)** and supported by **Sachs (1878)**. This
theory illustrates, that water is imbibed
through the cell wall materials and not by the
lumen. This theory was rejected based on the
ringing experiment, which proved that water
moves through the lumen of the cell and not
by a cell wall.

**3. Cohesion-tension or Cohesion and
transpiration pull theory**

Cohesion-tension theory was originally
proposed by Dixon and Jolly (1894) and
again put forward by Dixon (1914, 1924).
This theory is based on the following features:
**i. Strong cohesive force or tensile
strength of water**
Water molecules have the strong mutual
force of attraction called **cohesive force** due
to which they cannot be easily separated from
one another. Further, the attraction between
a water molecule and the wall of the xylem
element is called **adhesion.** These cohesive
and adhesive force works together to form
an unbroken continuous water column in the
xylem. The magnitude of the cohesive force
is much high (350 atm) and is more than
enough to ascent sap in the tallest trees.

**ii. Continuity of the water column in
the plant**

An important factor which can break
the water column is the introduction of air
bubbles in the xylem. Gas bubbles expanding
and displacing water within the xylem
element is called **cavitation or embolism**.
However, the overall continuity of the water
column remains undisturbed since water
diffuses into the adjacent xylem elements for
continuing ascent of sap.

iii.**Transpiration pull or Tension in the
unbroken water column**
The unbroken water column from leaf to
root is just like a rope. If the rope is pulled
from the top, the entire rope will move
upward. In plants, such a pull is generated by
the process of transpiration which is known
as **transpiration pull.**

Water vapour evaporates from mesophyll
cells to the intercellular spaces near stomata
as a result of active transpiration. The water
vapours are then transpired through the
stomatal pores. Loss of water from mesophyll
cells causes a decrease in water potential. So,
water moves as a pull from cell to cell along
the water potential gradient. This tension,
generated at the top (leaf) of the unbroken
water column, is transmitted downwards
from petiole, stem and finally reaches the
roots. The cohesion theory is the most
accepted among the plant physiologists today.

#### 11.6 Transpiration

Water absorbed by roots ultimately reaches
the leaf and gets released into the atmosphere
in the form of vapour. Only a small fraction
of water (less than 5%) is utilized in plant
development and metabolic process.
The loss of excess of water in the form of
vapour from various aerial parts of the plant is
called **transpiration**. Transpiration is a kind
of evaporation but differs by the involvement
of biological system. The amount of water
transpired is astounding (Table 11.4). The
water may move through the xylem at a rate
as fast as 75cm /min.

#### 11.6.1 Types of Transpiration

Transpiration is of following three types:

**1. Stomatal transpiration**

Stomata are microscopic structures present
in high number on the lower epidermis of
leaves. This is the most dominant form of
transpiration and being responsible for most
of the water loss (90 - 95%) in plants.

**2. Lenticular transpiration**

In stems of woody plants and trees, the
epidermis is replaced by periderm because of
secondary growth. In order to provide gaseous
exchange between the living cells and outer
atmosphere, some pores which looks like
lens-shaped raised spots are present on the
surface of the stem called **Lenticels.** The loss
of water from lenticels is very insignificant as
it amounts to only 0.1% of the total.

**3. Cuticular transpiration**

The cuticle is a waxy or resinous layer of **cutin,**
a fatty substance covering the epidermis of
leaves and other plant parts. Loss of water
through cuticle is relatively small and it is only
about 5 to 10 % of the total transpiration. The
thickness of cuticle increases in xerophytes
and transpiration is very much reduced or
totally absent.

#### 11.6.2 Structure of Stomata

The epidermis of leaves and green stems
possess many small pores called stomata.
The length and breadth of stomata is about
10-40µ and 3-10µ respectively. Mature leaves
contain between 50 and 500 stomata per
square mm. Stomata are made up of two
guard cells, special semi-lunar or kidney-
shaped living epidermal cells in the epidermis.
Guard cells are attached to surrounding
epidermal cells known as subsidiary cells or
accessory cells. The guard cells are joined
together at each end but they are free to
separate to form a pore between them. The
inner wall of the guard cell is thicker than the
outer wall (Figure 11.14). The stoma opens to
the interior into a cavity called **sub-stomatal
cavity** which remains connected with the
intercellular spaces.

![](/books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/20.png)

Figure 11.14: Structure of Stomata

#### 11.6.3 Mechanism of Stomatal ­Movement

Stomatal movements are regulated by the
change of turgor pressure in guard cells.
When water enters the guard cell, it swells
and its unevenly thickened walls stretch up
resulting in the opening of stomata. This
is due to concave non-elastic nature of
inner wall pulled away from each other and
stretching of the convex elastic natured outer
wall of guard cell.
Different theories have been proposed
regarding opening and closing of stomata. The
important theories of stomatal movement are
as follows,

1. Theory of Photosynthesis in guard cells
2. Starch – Sugar interconversion theory
3. Active potassium transport ion concept

**1. Theory of Photosynthesis in guard cells**

**Von Mohl (1856)** observed that stomata open
in light and close in the night. According to
him, chloroplasts present in the guard cells
photosynthesize in the presence of light
resulting in the production of carbohydrate
(Sugar) which increases osmotic pressure
in guard cells. It leads to the entry of water
from other cell and stomatal aperture opens.
The above process vice versa in night leads to
closure of stomata.

**Demerits**

1. Chloroplast of guard cells is
poorly developed and incapable of
performing photosynthesis.
2. The guard cells already possess much
amount of stored sugars.

**2. Starch – Sugar Interconversion theory**

i. According to **Lloyd (1908)**, turgidity
of guard cell depends on interconversion,
of starch and sugar. It was supported by
**Loftfield** (1921) as he found guard cells
containing sugar during the daytime when
they are open and starch during the night
when they are closed.

**ii. Sayre** (1920) observed that the
opening and closing of stomata depends
upon change in pH of guard cells. According
to him stomata open at high pH during
day time and become closed at low pH at
night. Utilization of CO 2 by photosynthesis
during light period causes an increase in pH
resulting in the conversion of starch to sugar.
Sugar increase in cell favours endosmosis and
increases the turgor pressure which leads to
opening of stomata. Likewise, accumulation
of CO 2 in cells during night decrease the pH
level resulting in the conversion of sugar to
starch. Starch decreases the turgor pressure
of guard cell and stomata close.
iii. The discovery of  enzyme
**phosphorylase** in guard cells by **Hanes**
(1940) greatly supports the starch-sugar
interconversion theory. The enzyme
phosphorylase hydrolyses starch into sugar
and high pH followed by endosmosis and
the opening of stomata during light. The vice
versa takes place during the night.

![](/books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/21.png)

iv. **Steward (1964)**proposed a
slightly modified scheme of starch-sugar
interconversion theory. According to
him, Glucose-1-phosphate is osmotically
inactive. Removal of phosphate from
Glucose-1-phosphate converts to Glucose
which is osmotically active and increases
the concentration of guard cell leading to
opening of stomata (Figure 11.15).

![](/books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/22.png)

**Figure 11.15:** Steward Scheme

**Objections to Starch-sugar interconversion
theory**
i. In monocots, guard cell does not have
starch.
ii. There is no evidence to show the
presence of sugar at a time when starch
disappears and stomata open.
iii. It fails to explain the drastic change in
pH from 5 to 7 by change of CO 2 .
3.**Theory of K + transport**
This theory was proposed by **Levit** (1974) and
elaborated by **Raschke** (1975). According to
this theory, the following steps are involved
in the stomatal opening:

![](/books/biology/unit-5/2transports-in-plants/23.png)

**Figure 11.16:** Theory of K + transport
Opening of stomata

**In light**

i. In guard cell, starch is converted into
organic acid (malic acid).
ii. Malic acid in guard cell dissociates to
malate anion and proton (H + ).
iii. Protons are transported through the
membrane into nearby subsidiary cells with
the exchange of K + (Potassium ions) from
subsidiary cells to guard cells. This process
involves an electrical gradient and is called
**ion exchange.**
iv. This ion exchange is an active process
and consumes ATP for energy.
v. Increased K + ions in the guard cell
are balanced by Cl – ions. Increase in solute
concentration decreases the water potential
in the guard cell.
vi. Guard cell becomes hypertonic and
favours the entry of water from surrounding
cells.
vii. Increased turgor pressure due to
the entry of water opens the stomatal pore
(Figure 11.16).

**In Dark**

i. In dark, photosynthesis stops and
respiration continues with accumulation of
CO 2 in the sub-stomatal cavity.
ii. Accumulation of CO 2 in cell lowers
the pH level.
iii. Low pH and a shortage of water in
the guard cell activate the stress hormone
**Abscisic acid**(ABA).
iv. ABA stops further entry of K + ions and
also induce K + ions to leak out to subsidiary
cells from guard cell.
v. Loss of water from guard cell reduces
turgor pressure and causes closure of stomata
(Figure 11.17).

**Figure 11.17:** Theory of K + transport
Closing of stomata

#### 11.6.4 Factors Affecting Rate of Transpiration

The factors affecting the rate of transpiration
can be categorized into two groups. They are

1. External or Environmental factors and 2.
Internal or plant factors.

**1. External or Environmental factors**

**i. Atmospheric humidity:** The rate of
transpiration is greatly reduced when the
atmosphere is very humid. As the air becomes
dry, the rate of transpiration is also increased
proportionately.
**ii. Temperature:** With the increase
in atmospheric temperature, the rate of
transpiration also increases. However, at very
high-temperatures stomata closes because of
flaccidity and transpiration stop.
iii. Light: Light intensity increases the
temperature. As in temperature, transpiration
is increased in high light intensity and
is decreased in low light intensity. Light
also increases the permeability of the
cell membrane, making it easy for water
molecules to move out of the cell.
**iv. Wind velocity:** In still air, the surface
above the stomata get saturated with water
vapours and there is no need for more
water vapour to come out. If the wind is
breezy, water vapour gets carried away near
leaf surface and DPD is created to draw
more vapour from the leaf cells enhancing
transpiration. However, high wind velocity
creates an extreme increase in water loss and
leads to a reduced rate of transpiration and
stomata remain closed.

{{<box title="">}}

#### Activity

What will happen if an indoor plant is
placed under fan and AC?
{{</box>}}

**v. Atmospheric pressure:**In low
atmospheric pressure, the rate of transpiration
increases. Hills favour high transpiration rate
due to low atmospheric pressure. However, it
is neutralized by low temperature prevailing
in the hills.
**vi. Water:** Adequate amount of water in
the soil is a pre-requisite for optimum plant
growth. Excessive loss of water through
transpiration leads to wilting. In general,
there are three types of wilting as follows,
**a. Incipient wilting:** Water content of
plant cell decreases but the symptoms are not
visible.
**b. Temporary wilting:** On hot summer
days, the freshness of herbaceous plants
reduces turgor pressure at the day time and
regains it at night.
**c. Permanent wilting:** The absorption of
water virtually ceases because the plant cell
does not get water from any source and the
plant cell passes into a state of permanent
wilting.
**2. Internal factors**

**i. Leaf area:** If the leaf area is more,
transpiration is faster and so xerophytes
reduce their leaf size.
ii. Leaf structure: Some anatomical
features of leaves like sunken stomata, the
presence of hairs, cuticle, the presence of
hydrophilic substances like gum, mucilage
help to reduce the rate of transpiration. In
xerophytes the structural modifications
are remarkable. To avoid transpiration, as
in **Opuntia**the stem is flattened to look
like leaves called **Phylloclade**. **Cladode** or
**cladophyll** in **Asparagus** is a modified stem
capable of limited growth looking like leaves.
In some plants, the petioles are flattened
and widened, to become **phyllodes** example
**Acacia melanoxylon.**

#### 11.6.5 Plant Antitranspirants

The term **antitranspirant**is used to
designate any material applied to plants for
the purpose of retarding transpiration. An
ideal antitranspirant checks the transpiration
process without disturbing the process of
gaseous exchange. Plant antitranspirants are
two types:
**1. To act as a physical barrier above the
stomata
Colourless plastics, Silicone oil and low
viscosity waxes** are sprayed on leaves
forming a thin film to act as a physical barrier
(for transpiration) for water but permeable
to CO 2 and O 2 . The success rate of a physical
barrier is limited.
**2. Induction of Stomata closure
Carbon-di-oxide** induces stomatal
closure and acts as a natural antitranspirant.
Further, the advantage of using CO 2 as
an antitranspirant is its inhibition of
photorespiration. **Phenyl Mercuric Acetate**
(PMA), when applied as a foliar spray to
plants, induces partial stomatal closure for
two weeks or more without any toxic effect.
Use of **abscisic acid** highly induces the
closing of stomata. **Dodecenyl succinic acid**
also effects on stomatal closure.
**Uses:**
• Antitranspirants reduce the enormous
loss of water by transpiration in crop plants.
• Useful for seedling transplantations in
nurseries.

#### 11.6.6 Guttation

![](/books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/25.png)

**Figure 11.18:** Structure of Hydathode

During high humidity in the atmosphere,
the rate of transpiration is much reduced.
When plants absorb water in such a
condition root pressure is developed due
to excess water within the plant. Thus
excess water exudates as liquid from the
edges of the leaves and is called **guttation**.
**Example:** Grasses, tomato, potato, brinjal
and Alocasia. Guttation occurs through
stomata like pores called **hydathodes**
generally present in plants that grow in
moist and shady places. Pores are present
over a mass of loosely arranged cells with
large intercellular spaces called **epithem**
(Figure 11.18). This mass of tissue lies near
vein endings (xylem and Phloem). The
liquid coming out of hydathode is not pure
water but a solution containing a number
of dissolved substances.

#### 11.6.7 Measurement of Transpiration

**1. Ganongs potometer**
Ganongs potometer is used to measure the
rate of transpiration indirectly. In this, the
amount of water absorbed is measured and
assumed that this amount is equal to the
amount of water transpired.
Apparatus consists of a horizontal
graduated tube which is bent in opposite
directions at the ends. One bent end is wide
and the other is narrow. A reservoir is fixed
to the horizontal tube near the wider end.
The reservoir has a stopcock to regulate
water flow. The apparatus is filled with water
from reservoir. A twig or a small plant is
fixed to the wider arm through a split cock.
The other bent end of the horizontal tube
is dipped into a beaker containing coloured
water. An air bubble is introduced into the
graduated tube at the narrow end (Figure
11.19). keep this apparatus in bright sunlight
and observe.As transpiration takes place, the
air bubble will move towards the twig. The
loss is compensated by water absorption
through the xylem portion of the twig. Thus,
the rate of water absorption is equal to the
rate of transpiration.

![](/books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/26.png)

**Figure 11.19:** Ganongs Potometer

**2. Cobalt chloride (CoCl 2 ) paper method**
Select a healthy dorsiventral leaf and clean
its upper and lower surface with dry cotton.
Now place a dry Cobalt chloride **(CoCl 2 )**
strips on both surface and immediately cover
the paper with glass slides and immobilize
them. It will be observed after some time that
the CoCl 2 strip of lower epidermis turns pink.
This indicates that CoCl 2 becomes hydrated
(CoCl 2 . 2H 2 O or CoCl 2 . 4H 2 O) due to water
vapours coming out through stomata. The
rate of transpiration is more on the lower
surface than in the upper surface of the
dorsiventral leaf.

#### 11.6.8 Significance of transpiration

Transpiration leads to loss of water, as stated
earlier in this lesson 95% of absorbed water
is lost in transpiration. It seems to be an
evil process to plants. However, number
of process like absorption of water, ascent
of sap and mineral absorption directly
rely on the transpiration. Moreover plants
withstand against scorching sunlight due to
transpiration. Hence the transpiration is a
**“necessary evil”** as stated by **Curtis.**

#### 11.7 Translocation of ­Organic Solutes

Leaves synthesize food material through
photosynthesis and store in the form of
starch grains. When required the starch is
converted into simple sugars. They must
be transported to various parts of the plant
system for further utilization. However, the
site of food production (leaves) and site of
utilization are separated far apart. Hence, the
organic food has to be transported to these
areas.
The phenomenon of food transportation
from the site of synthesis to the site of
utilization is known as **translocation of
organic solutes**. The term **solute** denotes
food material that moves in a solution.

#### 11.7.1 Path of Translocation

It has now been well established that phloem
is the path of translocation of solutes.
Ringing or girdling experiment will clearly
demonstrate the translocation of solute by
phloem.

#### 11.7.2 Ringing or girdling experiment

![](/books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/27.png)

**Figure 11.20:** Ringing experiment

The
experiment
the stage
removal of
Initial
stage involves Final
all the tissue outside to vascular cambium
(bark, cortex, and phloem) in woody stems
except xylem. Xylem is the only remaining
tissue in the girdled area which connects
upper and lower part of the plant. This setup
is placed in a beaker of water. After some
time, it is observed that a swelling on the
upper part of the ring appears as a result of
the accumulation of food material (Figure
11.20). If the experiment continues within
days, the roots die first. It is because, the
supply of food material to the root is cut
down by the removal of phloem. The roots
cannot synthesize their food and so they die
first. As the roots gradually die the upper part
(stem), which depends on root for the ascent
of sap, will ultimately die.

#### 11.7.3 Direction of Translocation

Phloem translocates the products of
photosynthesis from leaves to the area
of growth and storage, in the following
directions,
**Downward direction:** From leaves to
stem and roots.
**Upward direction:** From leaves
to developing buds, flowers, fruits for
consumption and storage. Germination
of seeds is also a good example of upward
translocation.

#### 11.7.4 Source and Sink

**Source** is defined as any organ in plants
which are capable of exporting food
materials to the areas of metabolism or
to the areas of storage. Examples: Mature
leaves, germinating seeds.
**Sink** is defined as any organ in plants
which receives food from source.Example:
Roots, tubers, developing fruits and immature
leaves (Figure 11.21).

**Figure 11.21:** Source and Sink

#### 1.7.5 Phloem Loading

The movement of **photosynthates** (products
of photosynthesis) from mesophyll cells to
phloem sieve elements of mature leaves is
known as phloem loading. It consists of
three steps.
**i. Sieve tube conducts sucrose only.**
But the photosynthate in chloroplast
mostly in the form of starch or ­
triose-phosphate which has to be transported
to the cytoplasm where it will be converted
into sucrose for further translocation.
**ii. Sucrose** moves from mesophyll to
nearby sieve elements by short distance
transport.
iii. From sieve tube to sink by
­long-distance transport.

![](/books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/29.png)

**Why plants transport
sugars as sucrose and
not as starch or glucose
or fructose?**

Glucose and Fructose
are simple monosaccharides, whereas,
Sucrose is a disaccharide composed
of glucose and fructose. Starch is a
polysaccharide of glucose. Sucrose and
starch are more efficient in energy storage
when compared to glucose and fructose,
but starch is insoluble in water. So it
cannot be transported via phloem and the
next choice is sucrose, being water soluble
and energy efficient, sucrose is chosen
as the carrier of energy from leaves to
different parts of the plant. Sucrose has
low viscosity even at high concentrations
and has no reducing ends which makes
it inert than glucose or fructose.During
photosynthesis, starch is synthesized
and stored in the chloroplast stroma and
sucrose is synthesized in the leaf cytosol
from which it diffuses to the rest of
the plant.

#### 11.7.6 Phloem Unloading

From sieve elements sucrose is translocated
into sink organs such as roots, tubers, flowers
and fruits and this process is termed as
**phloem unloading**. It consists of three steps:
**1. Sieve element unloading:** Sucrose leave
from sieve elements.
**2. Short distance transport:** Movement of
sucrose to sink cells.
**3. Storage and metabolism:** The final step
when sugars are stored or metabolized in
sink cells.

#### 11.7.7 Mechanism of Translocation

Several hypotheses have been proposed to
explain the mechanism of translocation.
Some of them are given below:

**1. Diffusion hypothesis**
As in diffusion process, this theory states
the translocation of food from higher
concentration (from the place of synthesis)
to lower concentration (to the place of
utilization) by the simple physical process.
However, the theory was rejected because
the speed of translocation is much higher
than simple diffusion and translocation is a
biological process which any poison can halt.
2. Activated diffusion theory
This theory was first proposed by Mason and
Maskell (1936). According to this theory, the
diffusion in sieve tube is accelerated either
by activating the diffusing molecules or by
reducing the protoplasmic resistance to their
diffusion.
3. Electro-Osmotic theory
The theory of electro osmosis was proposed
by Fenson (1957) and Spanner (1958).
According to this, an electric-potential across
the sieve plate causes the movement of water
along with solutes. This theory fails to explain
several problems concerning translocation.
4. Munch Mass Flow hypothesis
Mass flow theory was first proposed by
Munch (1930) and elaborated by Crafts
(1938). According to this hypothesis, organic
substances or solutes move from the region
of high osmotic pressure (from mesophyll)
to the region of low osmotic pressure along
the turgor pressure gradient. The principle
involved in this hypothesis can be explained
by a simple physical system as shown
in figure 11.22.

![](books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/30.png)

**Figure 11.22:** A model demonstrating
the Mass flow hyphothesis

Two chambers “A” and “B” made up of
semipermeable membranes are connected
by tube “T” immersed in a reservoir of water.
Chamber “A” contains highly concentrated
sugar solution while chamber “B” contains
dilute sugar solution. The following changes
were observed in the system,
i. The high concentration sugar solution
of chamber “A” is in a hypertonic state which
draws water from the reservoir by endosmosis.
ii. Due to the continuous entry of water
into chamber “A”, turgor pressure is increased.
iii. Increase in turgor pressure in chamber
“A” force, the mass flow of sugar solution to
chamber “B” through the tube “T” along
turgor pressure gradient.
iv. The movement of solute will continue
till the solution in both the chambers attains
the state of isotonic condition and the system
becomes inactive.
v. However, if new sugar solution is added
in chamber “A”, the system will start to run
again.
A similar analogous system as given in the
experiment exists in plants:
Chamber “A” is analogous to mesophyll
cells of the leaves which contain a higher
concentration of food material in soluble
form. In short “A” is the production point
called **“source”.**
Chamber “B” is analogous to cells of stem
and roots where the food material is utilized.
In short “B” is consumption end called **“sink”.**
Tube “T” is analogous to the sieve tube of
phloem.
Mesophyll cells draw water from the
xylem (reservoir of the experiment) of the
leaf by endosmosis leading to increase in the
turgor pressure of mesophyll cell. The turgor
pressure in the cells of stem and the roots
are comparatively low and hence, the soluble
organic solutes begin to flow en masse from
mesophyll through the phloem to the cells
of stem and roots along the gradient turgor
pressure.
In the cells of stem and roots, the organic
solutes are either consumed or converted into
insoluble form and the excess water is released
into xylem (by turgor pressure gradient)
through cambium.

**Merits:**
i. When a woody or herbaceous plant
is girdled, the sap contains high sugar
containing exudates from cut end.
ii. Positive concentration  gradient
disappears when plants are defoliated.

**Objections:**
i. This hypothesis explains the
unidirectional movement of solute only.
However, bidirectional movement of solute
is commonly observed in plants.
ii. Osmotic pressure of mesophyll cells
and that of root hair do not confirm the
requirements.
iii. This theory gives passive role to sieve
tube and protoplasm, while some workers
demonstrated the involvement of ATP.

#### 11.8 Mineral Absorption

Minerals in soil exist in two forms, either
dissolved in soil solution or adsorbed by
colloidal clay particle. Previously, it was
mistakenly assumed that absorption of
mineral salts from soil took place along
with absorption of water. But absorption of
minerals and ascent of sap are identified as
two independent processes. Minerals are
absorbed not only by root hairs but also by
the cells of epiblema.
Plasma membrane of root cells are not
permeable to all ions and also all ions of same
salt are not absorbed in equal rate.
Penetration and accumulation of ions into
living cells or tissues from surrounding
medium by crossing membrane is called
**mineral absorption.** Movement of ions
into and out of cells or tissues is termed as
transport or **flux**. Entry of the ion into cell is
called **influx** and exit is called **efflux**. Various
theories have been put forward to explain
this mechanism. They are categorized
under passive mechanisms (without the
involvement of metabolic energy) and active
mechanisms (involvement of metabolic
energy).

#### 11.8.1 Passive Absorption

**1. Ion-Exchange:**
Ions of external soil solution were exchanged
with same charged (anion for anion or cation
for cation) ions of the root cells. There are
two theories explaining this process of ion
exchange namely:

i. Contact exchange and ii. Carbonic
acid exchange.

**i. Contact exchange Theory**

![](/books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/31.png)

**Figure 11.23:** Contact Exchange theory

According to this theory, the ions
adsorbed on the surface of root cells and
clay particles (or clay micelles) are not held
tightly but oscillate within a small volume
of space called **oscillation volume.** Due to
small space, both ions overlap each other’s
oscillation volume and exchange takes place
(Figure 11.23).

**ii. Carbonic Acid Exchange Theory:**

According to this theory, soil solution
plays an important role by acting as a medium
for ion exchange. The CO 2 released during
respiration of root cells combines with water
to form carbonic acid (H 2 CO 3 ). Carbonic
acid dissociates into H + and HCO 3– in the soil
solution. These H + ions exchange with cations
adsorbed on clay particles and the cations from
micelles get released into soil solution and gets
adsorbed on root cells (Figure 11.24).

![](books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/32.png)

**Figure 11.24:** Carbonic Acid
Exchange theory

#### 11.8.2 Active Absorption

Absorption of ions against the concentration
gradient with the expenditure of metabolic
energy is called **active absorption**. In plants,
the vacuolar sap shows accumulation of
anions and cations against the concentration
gradient which cannot be explained by
theories of passive absorption. Mechanism
of active absorption of salts can be explained
through carrier concept.

#### Carrier Concept

This concept was proposed by **Van den**
**Honert** in 1937. The cell membrane is
largely impermeable to free ions. However,
the presence of **carrier molecules** in the
membrane acts as a vehicle to pick up or
bind with ions to form **carrier-ion-complex**,
which moves across the membrane. On the
inner surface of the membrane, this complex
breaks apart releasing ions into cell while
carrier goes back to the outer surface to pick
up fresh ions (Figure 11.25).

![](books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/33.png)

**Figure 11.25:** Carrier Concept

The concept can be explained using two
theories:
**1. Lundegardh’s Cytochrome Pump Theory:
Lundegardh and Burstrom**(1933) observed
a correlation between respiration and anion
absorption. When a plant is transferred from
water to a salt solution the rate of respiration
increases which is called as **anion respiration**
or **salt respiration**. Based on this observation
**Lundegardh** (1950 and 1954) proposed
cytochrome pump theory which is based on
the following assumptions:
i. The mechanism of anion and cation
absorption are different.
ii. Anions are absorbed through
cytochrome chain by an active process,
cations are absorbed passively.
iii. An oxygen gradient responsible
for oxidation at the outer surface of the
membrane and reduction at the inner surface.
According to this theory, the enzyme
dehydrogenase on inner surface is responsible
for the formation of protons (H + ) and
electrons (e – ). As electrons pass outward
through electron transport chain there is a
corresponding inward passage of anions.
Anions are picked up by oxidized cytochrome
oxidase and are transferred to other members
of chain as they transfer the electron to the
next component (Figure 11.26).

![](books/biology/unit-5/transports-in-plants/34.png)

**Figure 11.26:** Cytochrome Pump theory

The theory assumes that cations (C + )
move passively along the electrical gradient
created by the accumulation of anions (A – ) at
the inner surface of the membrane.
Main defects of the above theory are:
(i) Cations also induce respiration.
(ii) Fails to explain the selective uptake
of ions.
(iii) It explains absorption of anions only.

**2. Bennet-Clark’s Protein-Lecithin Theory:**

In 1956, **Bennet-Clark** proposed that the
carrier could be a protein associated with
**phosphatide** called as **lecithin**. The carrier
is **amphoteric** (the ability to act either as an
acid or a base) and hence both cations and
anions combine with it to form **Lecithin-
ion complex** in the membrane. Inside the
membrane, Lecithin-ion complex is broken
down into phosphatidic acid and choline
along with the liberation of ions. Lecithin again
gets regenerated from **phosphatidic acid** and
**choline**in the presence of the enzyme choline
acetylase and choline esterase (Figure 11.27).
ATP is required for regeneration of lecithin.

**Figure 11.27:** Protein-Lecithin theory

#### 11.8.3 Donnan equilibrium

Within the cell, some of the ions never
diffuse out through the membrane. They
are trapped within the cell and are called
fixed ions. But they must be balanced by
the ions of opposite charge. Assuming that
a concentration of fixed anions is present
inside the membrane, more cations would be
absorbed in addition to the normal exchange
to maintain the equilibrium. Therefore, the
cation concentration would be greater in the
internal than in the external solution. This
electrical balance or equilibrium controlled
by electrical as well as diffusion phenomenon
is known as the **Donnan equilibrium.**

#### Summary

There are two types of transports namely short
and long distance in plants to translocate sap
and solutes. Based on energy requirement,
the transport may either be passive or
active. The process of diffusion, facilitated
diffusion, imbibition and osmosis are driven
by concentration gradient like a ball rolling
down to a slope and hence, no energy is
needed. The water absorbed (either active
or passive) from the soil by root hairs must
reach the xylem for further transportation.
There are three possible routes to reach the
xylem from root hairs. They are i) apoplast ii)
symplast and/or iii) transmembrane. Various
theories explain the path of sap in the xylem
and Dixon’s Cohesion-tension theory is the
most accepted one. Transpiration is mostly
carried out by stomata, which has guard
cells. The general mechanism of stomatal
movement is based on entry and exit of water
molecules in guard cells. Many theories are
there to explain how water enters and exits
from guard cells. The theory of potassium
transport enumerates two different reactions
separately run for opening and closing
of stomata. Contrary to ascent of sap by
xylem in an upward direction, the path of
solute which consists of the photosynthetic
products is always in phloem and translocate
multidirectional. The point of origin of
translocation is photosynthetic leaves which
are the source. On the other hand, point of
utilization is called sink. According to Munch
mass flow hypothesis, the solutes move along
the concentration gradient in a bulk flow.
Although minerals are dissolved in soil
water, they do not tend together with water
to enter the root hairs during absorption of
water. Mineral absorption is independent
of water absorption. Minerals are absorbed
either actively or passively.
