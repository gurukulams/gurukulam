Over 450 million years ago (the
Ordovician period in Paleozoic era) plants
migrated from their own sophisticated
water world to newly formed land. The land
had harsh environment; water availability
was deeper and so plants struggled for
getting water for their very existence. Some
of them failed to survive and rest adopted
themselves to the new world. The biggest
adaptations followed for their survival was
building their own water absorbing systems
to draw water from deep inside the land. The
creation and updating of water absorbing
system (vascular tissues) led to the diversity
of the plant kingdom. The gregarious growth
of prehistoric pteridophytes, gymnosperms
and present-day flowering plants led to the
biggest challenge in the transport of water
from root to several meters high trees
against gravity. In this chapter, we will study
the events taking place between the gain
of water in roots and loss in leaves and the
mechanisms behind the basic physical and
biological processes in the movement of
water, gases and minerals in plants. Further,
we study how food material synthesized
in the leaf can be transported to various
utilizing and storage areas against struggles
and challenges.

#### 11.1 Types of Transport

Transport is the process of moving water,
minerals and food to all parts of the plant
body. Conducting tissues such as xylem and
phloem play an important role in this.
What is the need for transport? Water
absorbed from roots must travel up to
leaves by xylem for food preparation by
photosynthesis. Likewise, food prepared
from leaves has to travel to all parts of the
plant including roots. Both the processes are
interconnected and depend on each other.
 Based on the distance travelled by water
(sap) or food (solute) they are classified as
(a) Short distance (Cell to cell transport)
and (b) Long distance transport.

Plants and animals
evolved separately
but developed
c o m p a r a b l e
structures to control
transport of water
and dissolved
chemicals. But whose
transport system is
optimally designed
to offer selective
advantage? In plants,
transport through xylem has allowed
growth in height and colonization of diverse
habitats and the system has to be extensive
as Photosynthesis requires water. Murray’s
law predicts the thickness of branches in
transport networks, such that the cost for
transport and maintenance of the transport
medium is minimized. This law is observed
in the vascular and respiratory systems of
animals, xylem in plants, and the respiratory
system of insects. Further research in this
area will improve our understanding of
natural world.

**i. Short-distance (Cell to cell transport):**
Involvement of few cells, mostly in the
lateral direction. They are the connecting
link to xylem and phloem from root hairs
or leaf tissues respectively. Examples:
Diffusion, Imbibition, and Osmosis.<br>

**ii. Long-distance transport: Transport**
within the network of xylem or
phloem is an example for long-distance
transport.
**Examples:** Ascent of Sap and
Translocation
of Solutes. <br>

 Based on energy expenditure during
transport, they are classified as **(a) passive transport and**
**(b) active transport.** <br>

**i. Passive transport:** It is a downhill process
which utilizes physical forces
like gravity
and concentration. No energy
expenditure
is required. It includes
diffusion, facilitated
diffusion, imbibition, and osmosis.

**ii. Active transport:** It is a biological
process
and it runs based on the energy
obtained
from respiration. It is an uphill process.

#### 11.2 Cell to Cell Transport
Cell to cell or short distance transport covers
the limited area and consists of few cells. They
are the facilitators or tributaries to the longdistance
transport. The driving force for the
cell to cell transport can be passive or active
**(Figure 11.1)**. The following chart illustrate
the various types of cell to cell transport:

##### 11.2.1 Passive Transport
1. **Diffusion**
When we expose a lightened incense stick
or mosquito coil or open a perfume bottle
in a closed room, we can smell the odour
everywhere in the room. This is due to the even
distribution of perfume molecules throughout
the room. This process is called **diffusion**.
In **diffusion**, the movement of molecules
is continuous and random in order in all
directions **(Figure 11.2)**.

![**Distributionof molecules in diffusion,Final stage**](/books/biology/unit-5/transport-in-plants/05.png)

{{<box title="Diffusion:">}}
The net movement of molecules
from a region of their higher concentration
to a region of their lower concentration
along a concentration gradient until an
equilibrium is attained.

#### Characteristics of diffusion

i. It is a passive process, hence no energy
expenditure involved.<br>
ii. It is independent of the living system.<br>
iii. Diffusion is obvious in gases and liquids.<br>
iv. Diffusion is rapid over a shorter
distance but extremely slow over a
longer distance.<br>
v. The rate of diffusion is determined by
temperature, concentration gradient and
relative density.<br>

#### Significance of diffusion in Plants
i. Gaseous exchange of O2 and CO2
between the atmosphere and stomata
of leaves takes place by the process
of diffusion. O2 is absorbed during
respiration and CO2 is absorbed during
photosynthesis.<br>
ii. In transpiration, water vapour from
intercellular spaces diffuses into
atmosphere through stomata by the
process of diffusion.<br>
iii. The transport of ions in mineral salts
during passive absorption also takes place
by this process.<br>

Surgical theatres must be
free from germs to prevent
infection during surgeries. A mixture of
Formalin and Potassium permanganate
produces enormous fumes which will kill all
pathogens in an enclosed area. This method
is known as fumigation and operates by
diffusion.

**2. Facilitated Diffusion**
Cell membranes allow water and nonpolar
molecules to permeate by simple diffusion.
For transporting polar molecules such as
ions, sugars, amino acids, nucleotides and
many cell metabolites is not merely based on
concentration gradient. It depends on,
**i. Size of molecule:** Smaller molecules
diffuse faster.<br>
**ii. Solubility of the molecule:** Lipid soluble
substances easily and rapidly pass
through the membrane. But water soluble
substances are difficult to pass through
the membrane. They must be facilitated
to pass the membrane.

{{<box title="Types of Membrane Permeability">}}

A solution is made up of solute particles
dissolved in a solvent and the permeability
of the above components depends on the
nature of cell membranes, which is given
below:
**Impermeable:** Inhibit the movement
of both solvent and solute molecules.
Example: Suberised, cutinised or liginifid
cell walls.
**Permeable:** They allow diffusion of
both solvent and solute molecules through
them.**Example:** Cellulosic cell wall.
**Semi permeable:** Semi permeable
allow diffusion of solvent molecules
but do not allow the passage of solute
molecule. **Example:** Parchment paper.
**Selectively permeable:** All bio
membranes allow some solutes to pass
in addition to the solvent molecules.
**Example:** Plasmalemma, tonoplast, and
membranes of cell organelles.

In facilitated diffusion, molecules cross
the cell membrane with the help of special
membrane proteins called transport proteins,
without the expenditure of ATP.
There are two types of transport proteins
present in the cell membrane. They are
channel protein and a carrier protein.
##### I. Channel Protein
Channel protein forms a channel or tunnel
in the cell membrane for the easy passage of
molecules to enter the cell. The channels are
either open or remain closed. They may open
up for specific molecules. Some channel
proteins create larger pores in the outer
membrane. **Examples:** Porin and Aquaporin.<br>
**i. Porin**
Porin is a large transporter protein found in
the outer membrane of plastids, mitochondria
and bacteria which facilitates smaller
molecules to pass through the membrane.<br>
**ii. Aquaporin**
Aquaporin is a water channel protein embedded
in the plasma membrane. It regulates the
massive amount of water transport across
the membrane (Figure 11.3). Plants contain
a variety of aquaporins. Over 30 types of
aquaporins are known from maize. Currently,
they are also recognized to transport substrates
like glycerol, urea, CO2, NH3, metalloids, and
**Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)** in addition
to water. They increase the permeability of the
membrane to water. They confer drought and
salt stress tolerance.<br>

##### II. Carrier Protein
Carrier protein acts as a vehicle to carry
molecules from outside of the membrane to
inside the cell and vice versa (Figure 11.4). Due
to association with molecules to be transported,
the structure of carrier protein gets modified
until the dissociation of the molecules.
