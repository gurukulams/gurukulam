Life on earth is made up of organic
compounds. How do we get these organic
compounds? Ultimately, plants are the main
source of all kinds of carbon compounds in
this planet. We directly or indirectly depend on
plants for this. Plants are the major machinery
which produce organic compounds like
carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids
and other biomolecules.
Though man has reached the glory of
achievements still he is not able to imitate the
metabolic activities of plants which produces
energy resources and other biomolecules.
The plants get energy from sun by
converting solar or radiant energy into chemical
energy by the process of Photosynthesis,
which acts as a driving force for both biotic
and abiotic world. Photosynthesis produces
1700 million tonnes of dry matter per year
by fixing 75 × 10 12 Kg of carbon every year.
Photosynthetic organisms use only 0.2 % of
incident solar light on earth. Carbohydrates
produced by photosynthesis are the basic raw
material for respiration and also to produce
many organic compounds. It maintains
atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide level.
Photosynthesis consumes atmospheric carbon
dioxide which is continuously added by the
respiration of organisms. Photosynthesis is
major endergonic reaction. In this chapter, we

**A quest for future energy**
Hydrogen is considered as a promising
energy vector for the next generation. It can
be used for “green” electricity production or
developing cogeneration systems such as fuel
cells. The sustainability of its employment
depends on the energy source used to
synthesize it from hydrogen-rich compounds
such as water or biomass. The splitting of
water in hydrogen and oxygen by means of
solar radiation in Photolysis is common in
plants. Water splitting is not an easy process
to mimic artificially but preliminary success
is achieved so far. If young minds take up this
as their research ambition a revolution can
be made in green energy.<br>

will study about the energy yielding process
of photosynthesis and various types of energy
utilization processes to produce carbohydrates.

#### 13.1 Definition, Significance and Site of Photosynthesis <br>
##### 13.1.1 Definition of Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is referred as photochemical
oxidation and reduction reactions carried out
with the help of light, converting solar energy
into chemical energy. It is the most important
anabolic process. Plants and photosynthetic
bacteria use simple raw materials like carbon
dioxide water and with the help of light
energy synthesize carbohydrates and evolve
oxygen. The overall chemical equation for
photosynthesis is:<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/photosynthesis/02.png)<br>
**Ruben** and **Kamen** (1941) demonstrated
six molecules of water as insufficient for the
evolution of 6 molecules of O 2 and modified
the equation as:<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/photosynthesis/03.png)<br>
Photosynthesis is a collection of oxidation
and reduction reactions (Redox reaction).
**Oxidation-** Water is oxidised into oxygen
(loss of electrons).
**Reduction** – CO2 is reduced into
Carbohydrates (gain of electrons).
In some bacteria, oxygen is not evolved
and is called as **non-oxygenic** and **anaerobic**
**photosynthesis**. Examples: Green sulphur,
Purple sulphur and green filamentous bacteria.

#### 13.1.2 Significance of Photosynthesis <br>
1. Photosynthetic organisms provide food for
all living organisms on earth either directly
or indirectly.<br>
2. It is the only natural process that liberates
oxygen in the atmosphere and balances the
oxygen level.<br>
3. Photosynthesis balances the oxygen and
carbon cycle in nature.<br>
4. Fuels such as coal, petroleum and other fossil
fuels are from preserved photosynthetic
plants.<br>
5. Photosynthetic organisms are the primary
producers on which all consumers depend
for energy.<br>
6. Plants provide fodder, fibre, fire wood,
timber, useful medicinal products and these
sources come by the act of photosynthesis.<br>

#### 13.1.3 Site of Photosynthesis
Chloroplasts are the main site of
photosynthesis and both energy yielding
process (Light reaction) and fixation of
carbon di oxide (Dark reaction)that takes
place in chloroplast. It is a double wall
membrane bounded organelle, discoid or
lens shaped, 4–10 µm in diameter and 1–33
µm in thickness. The membrane is a unit
membrane and space between them is 100
to 200 A ° . A colloidal and proteinaceous
matrix called stroma is present inside.

![](/books/biology/unit-5/photosynthesis/04.png)<br>
Figure 13.1: (a) 3D view of chloroplast (b) Sectional view of chloroplast

A sac like membranous system called
thylakoid or lamellae is present in stroma
and they are arranged one above the other
forming a stack of coin like structure called
granum (plural grana). Each chloroplast
contains 40 to 80 grana and each granum
consists of 5 to 30 thylakoids.
Thylakoids found in granum are called
grana lamellae and in stroma are called
stroma lamellae. Thylakoid disc size is
0.25 to 0.8 micron in diameter. A thinner
lamella called Fret membrane connects
grana. Pigment system I is located on
outer thylakoid membrane facing stroma
and Pigment system II is located on inner
membrane facing lumen of thylakoid.
Grana lamellae have both PS I and PS II
whereas stroma lamellae have only PS I.
Chloroplast contains 30–35 Proteins,
20–30% phospholipids, 5–10% chlorophyll,<br>

![](books/biology/unit-5/photosynthesis/05.png)<br>
4–5% Carotenoids, 70S ribosomes, circular
DNA and starch grains. Inner surface
of lamellar membrane consists of small
spherical structure called as Quantasomes.
Presence of 70S ribosome and DNA
gives them status of semi-autonomy and
proves endosymbiotic hypothesis which
says chloroplast evolved from bacteria.
Thylakoid contains pigment systems which
produces ATP and NADPH 1 H 1 using
solar energy. Stroma contains enzyme which
reduces carbon di oxide into carbohydrates.
In Cyanobacteria thylakoid lies freely in
cytoplasm without envelope (Figure 13.1)

#### 13.2 Photosynthetic ­Pigments
A photosynthetic pigment is a pigment that
is present in chloroplasts or photosynthetic
bacteria which captures the light energy
necessary for photosynthesis (Table 13.1).

#### 13.2.1 Chlorophyll
Chlorophyll 'a' is the primary pigment which
acts as a reaction centre and all other pigments
act as accessory pigments and trap solar
energy and then transfer it to chlorophyll 'a'.
Chlorophyll molecules have a tadpole like
structure. It consists of Mg-Porphyrin head
(Hydrophilic Head) and (Lipophilic tail) Phytol
tail. The Porphyrin head consists of four pyrrol
rings linked together by C-H bridges. Each
pyrrole ring comprises of four carbons and
one nitrogen atom. Porphyrin ring has several
side groups which alter the properties of the
pigment. Different side groups are indicative
of various types of chlorophyll. The Phytol tail
made up of 20 carbon alcohol is attached to
carbon 7 of the Pyrrole ring IV. It has a long
propionic acid ester bond. Long lipophilic tail
helps in anchoring chlorophyll to the lamellae.

#### 13.2.2 Carotenoids <br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/photosynthesis/06.png)<br>
**Figure 13.2:** Changes in Fruit colour due to
difference in pigmentation

Carotenoids are yellow to orange pigments,
mostly tetraterpens and these pigments absorb
light strongly in the blue to violet
region of visible spectrum. These
pigments protect chlorophyll from
photo-oxidative damage. Hence, they
are called as **shield pigments**. These
pigments absorb light and transfer
these to chlorophyll. Almost all
carotenoid pigments have 40 carbon
atoms. Ripening of fruits, floral colours
and leaf colour change during autumn
is due to Carotenoids (Carotene and
Xanthophyll) (Figure 13.2).
**i. Carotenes:** <br>
Orange, Red, Yellow and Brownish
pigments, hydrocarbons (Lipids)
and most of them are tetraterpenes(C 40 H 56 ).
Carotene is the most abundant Carotene in
plants and it is a precursor of Vitamin A.
Lycopene is the red pigment found in the
fruits of tomato, red peppers and roses.<br>
**ii. Xanthophylls:**<br>
Yellow (C 40 H 56 O 2 ) pigments are like
carotenes but contain oxygen. Lutein is
responsible for yellow colour change of
leaves during autumn season. Examples:
Lutein, Violaxanthin and Fucoxanthin.

#### 13.2.3 Phycobilins <br>
They are proteinaceous pigments, soluble
in water, and do not contain Mg and
Phytol tail. They exist in two forms such
as 1. Phycocyanin found in cyanobacteria
2. Phycoerythrin found in rhodophycean
algae (Red algae).

#### 13.3 Spectrum of ­Electromagnetic Radiation

In the total electromagnetic spectrum,visible
light is the smallest part. The entire life on
earth depends on light and is the driving
force for all organisms. Plants have natural
potential to utilize solar energy directly. In
the given picture electromagnetic radiation
spectrum and components of visible
spectrum are mentioned. The wavelength
of solar radiation which reaches the earth 

![](/books/biology/unit-5/photosynthesis/07.png)<br>
**Figure 13.4:** Electromagnetic Spectrum

is between 300 to 2600 nm. The visible
spectrum ranges between 390 to 763 nm
(3900 å to 7630 å). The colour of the light
is determined by the wavelength. Energy
of the quantum is inversely proportional
to wavelength. Shorter wavelength has
more energy than longer wavelength.
Electromagnetic spectrum consists of
7 types of radiations such as gamma rays,
X rays, U-V rays, Visible light spectrum,
infrared rays, electric rays and radio rays
(Figure 13. 4).

{{<box title=" ">}}
![](/books/biology/unit-5/photosynthesis/08.png)<br>

Light is extremely variable
and if radiation is evenly
distributed over the globe it is
sufficient to melt 35 m thick
ice layer.
{{</box>}}

**Properties of Light** <br>
1.Light is a transverse electromagnetic
wave.<br>
2.It consists of oscillating electric and
magnetic fields that are perpendicular
to each other and perpendicular to the
direction of propagation of the light.<br>
3.Light moves at a speed of 3 × 10 8 ms –1<br>
4.Wavelength is the distance between
successive crests of the wave.<br>
5.Light as a particle is called **photon.** Each
photon contains an amount of energy
known as **quantum.**<br>
6.The energy of a photon depends on the
frequency of the light (Figure 13.5).<br>

**Separation of Chlorophyll pigments by
paper Chromatography method**<br>
**Step 1.** Extract chlorophyll pigment from
the leaves using 80% Acetone.<br>
**Step 2.** Allow to concentrate by evaporation.
**Step 3.** Apply few drops on one end above
2 cm from the edge of a chromatographic
paper.<br>
**Step 4.** A solvent with mixture of Petroleum
ether and acetone in the ratio of 9:1 is
prepared and poured into development
chamber.<br>
**Step 5.** Place the strip above the solvent by
placing one end of the strip touching the
solvent.<br>
**Observation**
After one hour observe the chromatographic
paper. You can find the pigments
being separated into four distinct spots
(Figure 13. 4).<br>

#### 13.4 Photosynthetic Unit (Quantasome)
 
 Quantasomes are the morphological
expression of physiological photosynthetic
units, located on the inner membrane
of thylakoid lamellae. Each quantasome
measures about 180 A × 160 A and
100 A thickness. In 1952, **Steinman**
observed granular structures in chloroplast
lamellae under electron microscope. Later,
**Park** and **Biggins** (1964) confirmed these
granular structures as physiological units
of photosynthesis and coined the term
Quantasome. According to them one
quantasome contains about 230 chlorophyll
molecules. A minimum number of
chlorophyll and other accessory pigments
act together in a photochemical reaction to
release one oxygen or to reduce one molecule
of CO 2 . It constitutes a photosynthetic unit.
(Figure 13.6) **Emerson** and **Arnold** (1932)
based on flashing light experiment found
2500 chlorophyll molecules are required
to fix one molecule of CO 2 . However, the
reduction or fixation of one CO 2 requires
10 quanta of light and so each unit would
contain 1/10 of 2500 i.e. 250 molecules.
Usually 200 to 300 chlorophyll molecules
are considered as a physiological unit of
photosynthesis. According to Emerson
8 quanta of light are required for the release
of one oxygen molecule or reduction of one
Carbon dioxide moleccule. The quantum yield is 1/8 or 12%.

**Figure 13.6:** Quantasome

#### 13.5 Absorption Spectrum and Action Spectrum<br>
##### 13.5.1 Absorption Spectrum

The term absorption refers to complete
retention of light, without reflection or
transmission. Pigments absorb different
wavelengths of light. A curve obtained
by plotting the amount of absorption of
different wavelengths of light by a pigment
is called its **absorption spectrum**.<br>
• Chlorophyll 'a' and chlorophyll 'b' absorb
quanta from blue and red region<br>
• Maximum absorption peak for different
forms of chlorophyll 'a' is 670 to 673, 680
to 683 and 695 to 705nm.<br>
• Chlorophyll 'a' 680 (P680) and Chlorophyll
'a' 700 (P700) function as trap centre for
PS II and PS I respectively.<br>

#### 13.5.2 Action Spectrum <br>
The effectiveness of different wavelength of
light on photosynthesis is measured by plotting
against quantum yield. The curve showing the
rate of photosynthesis at different wavelengths
of light is called action spectrum. From the
graph showing **action spectrum**, it can be
concluded that maximum photosynthesis
takes place in blue and red region of the
spectrum. This wavelength of the spectrum
is the absorption maxima for Chlorophyll (a)
and Chlorophyll (b). The Action Spectrum
is instrumental in the discovery of the
existence of two photosystems in O 2 evolving
photosynthesis (Figure 13.7).<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/photosynthesis/12.png)<br>
**Figure 13.7:** Absorption and action spectrum

#### 13.6 Emerson’s Experiments and Hill’s Reaction <br>
##### 13.6.1 Red Drop or Emerson’s First Effect <br>
**Emerson** conducted experiment in
*Chlorella* using only one wavelength of light
(monochromatic light) at a time and he
measured quantum yield. He plotted a graph
of the quantum yield in terms of O 2 evolution
at various wavelengths of light. His focus
was to determine at which wavelength the
photochemical yield of oxygen was maximum.
He found that in the wavelength of 600 to 680
the yield was constant but suddenly dropped
in the region above 680 nm (red region). The
fall in the photosynthetic yield beyond red
region of the spectrum is referred as **Red
drop or Emerson’s first effect.**

#### 3.6.2 Emerson’s Enhancement Effect

Emerson modified his first
experiment by supplying
shorter wavelength of light
(red light) along with longer
wavelength of light (far
red light). He found that
the monochromatic light
of longer wavelength (far red light) when
supplemented with shorter wavelength of
light (red light) enhanced photosynthetic yield
and recovered red drop. This enhancement
of photosynthetic yield is referred to as
Emerson’s Enhancement Effect (Figure 13.8)<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/photosynthesis/13.png)<br>

(650 1 710 nm) 5 72.5 (Enhancement effect).

#### 13.6.3 Hill’s Reaction <br>
**R. Hill (1937)** isolated chloroplasts
and when they were illuminated in the
presence of suitable electron acceptors
such as ferricyanide, they were reduced to
ferrocyanide and oxygen is evolved. Hill’s
Reaction is now considered to be equivalent
to Light Reaction.<br>
*Conclusions of Hill’s Reaction:* <br>
1. During photosynthesis oxygen is
evolved from water.<br>
2. Electrons for the reduction of CO 2 are
obtained from water.<br>
3. Reduced substance produced, later
helps to reduce CO_2 <br>
2H2O + 2A -------> 2 AH2 + O2 <br>
A is the Hydrogen acceptor, the common *in
vitro* hydrogen acceptors are ferricyanide,
benzoquinone and Di Chloro Phenol Indole
Phenol (DCPIP).

#### 13.7 Modern Concept of Photosynthesis <br>
Photosynthesis is an Oxidation and Reduction
process. Water is oxidised
to release O2 and CO2 is
reduced to form sugars. The
first phase requires light and
is called **light reaction or
Hill’s reaction.**
**1. Light reaction:** It is a photochemical reaction
whereas dark reaction is a thermochemical
reaction.
Solar energy is trapped by chlorophyll
and stored in the form of chemical energy
(assimilatory power)as ATP and reducing
power NADPH 1 H 1 . NADPH 1 H 1
alone are known as **reducing powers.** This
reaction takes place in thylakoid membrane
of the chloroplast. Oxygen is evolved as a
result of splitting of water molecules by light.
Light reaction is discussed in two phases:
**i. Photo-oxidation Phase:**
• Absorption of light energy.<br>
• Transfer of energy from accessory
pigments to reaction centre.<br>
• Activation of Chlorophyll 'a' molecule.<br>
**ii. Photo Chemical Phase:**
• Photolysis of water and oxygen e ­ volution <br>
• Electron transport and synthesis of
assimilatory power. <br>

![](/books/biology/unit-5/photosynthesis/14.png)<br>
**Figure 13.9:** Light and Dark Reaction

**2. Dark reaction (Biosynthetic phase):** Fixation
and reduction of CO 2 into carbohydrates
with the help of assimilatory power produced
during light reaction. This reaction does not
require light and is not directly light driven.
Hence, it is called as **Dark reaction or Calvin-
Benson cycle** (Figure 13.9).

#### 13.8 Photo-Oxidation Phase of Light Reaction
The action of photon plays a vital role in
excitation of pigment molecules to release
an electron. When the molecules absorb a
photon, it is in excited state. When the light
source turned off, the high energy electrons
return to their normal low energy orbitals as
the excited molecule goes back to its original
stable condition known as **ground state.**
When molecules absorb or emit light they
change their electronic state. Absorption of
blue light excites the chlorophyll to higher
energy state than absorption of Red light,
because the energy of photon is higher when
their wavelength is shorter. When the pigment
molecule is in an excited state, this excitation
energy is utilised for the phosphorylation.
Phosphorylation takes place with the help of
light generated electron and hence it is known
as **photophosphorylation.**

#### 13.8.1 Photosystem and Reaction Centre <br>
• Thylakoid membrane
contains Photosystem I
(PS I) and Photosystem
II (PS II).<br>
• PS I is in unstacked
region of granum facing
stroma of chloroplast.<br>
• PS II is found in stacked region of thylakoid
membrane facing lumen of thylakoid.<br>
•Each Photosystem consists of central
core complex (CC) and light harvesting
Complex (LHC) or Antenna molecules
(Figure 13.10).<br>
• The core complex consists of respective
reaction centre associated with proteins,
electron donors and acceptors.<br>
• PS I – CC I consists of reaction centre
P700 and LHC I.<br>
• PS II – CC II consists of reaction centre
P680 and LHC II (Table 13.2).<br>
• Light Harvesting Complex consists of
several chlorophylls, carotenoids and
xanthophyll molecules.<br>
• The main function of LHC is to harvest
light energy and transfer it to their
respective reaction centre.<br>

**Figure 13.10:** Photosystem

#### 13.9 Photo chemical phase of light reaction
In this phase electrons pass through electron
carrier molecules and generate assimilatory
powers ATP and NADPH 1 H 1 . Splitting of
water molecule generates electrons replacing
electrons produced by the light.

**Table**

#### 13.9.1 Photolysis of Water <br>
The process of Photolysis is associated with
Oxygen Evolving Complex (OEC) or water
splitting complex in pigment system II and
is catalysed by the presence of Mn 11 and
Cl – . When the pigment system II is active it
receives light and the water molecule splits into
OH – ions and H 1 ions. The OH – ions unite to
form water molecules again and release O 2 and
electrons (Figure 13.11).

#### 13.9.2 Electron Transport Chain of Chloroplast

Electron Transport Chain in each photosystem
involves four complexes:
• *Core Complex (CC):* CC I in PS I the reaction
centre is P700, CC II in PS II the reaction
centre is P680 <br>
•Light Harvesting Complex or Antenna
complex (LHC):<br>
• Two types: LHC I in PS I and LHC II in PS II.<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/photosynthesis/17.png)<br>
**Figure 13.12:** Electron Transport Chain in Chloroplast

• Cytochrome b6 f complex: It is the non-pigmented protein complex
connecting PS I and PS II. Plastoquinone
(PQ) and Plastocyanin (PC) are
intermediate complexes acting as mobile
or shuttle electron carriers of Electron
Transport Chain. PQ acts as shuttle
between PS II and Cytochrome b 6 - f
complex and PC connects <br>
• Cytochrome b6 -f and PS I complex.<br>
• *ATPase complex or Coupling factor:* It is found
in the surface of thylakoid membrane. This
complex is made up of CF1 and CF0 factors.
This complex utilizes energy from ETC and
converts ADP and inorganic phosphate (P i )
into ATP (Figure 13.12).<br>

#### 13.10 Photophosphorylation

Phosphorylation taking place during
respiration is called as **oxidative
phosphorylation** and ATP produced by the
breakdown of substrate is known as **substrate**
**level phosphorylation.** In this topic, we
are going to learn about phosphorylation
taking place in chloroplast with the help of
light. During the movement of electrons
through carrier molecules ATP and NADPH
+ H+ are produced. Phosphorylation is the
process of synthesis of ATP by the addition
of inorganic phosphate to ADP. The addition
of phosphate here takes place with the help of
light generated electron and so it is called as
**photophosphorylation.** It takes place in both
cyclic and non-cyclic electron transport.

#### 13.10.1 Cyclic Photophosphorylation 
Cyclic photophosphorylation
refers to the electrons ejected from
the pigment system I (Photosystem
I) and again cycled back to the PS
I. When the photons activate P700
reaction centre photosystem II is
activated. Electrons are raised to
the high energy level. The primary
electron acceptor is Ferredoxin
Reducing Substance (FRS) which
transfers electrons to Ferredoxin
(Fd), Plastoquinone (PQ), cytochrome b6-f
complex, Plastocyanin (PC) and finally
back to chlorophyll P700 (PS I). During
this movement of electrons Adenosine Di
Phosphate (ADP) is phosphorylated, by
the addition of inorganic phosphate and
generates Adenosine Tri Phosphate (ATP).
Cyclic electron transport produces only ATP
and there is no NADPH + H+ formation. At
each step of electron transport, electron loses
potential energy and is used by the transport
chain to pump H+ ions across the thylakoid
membrane. The proton gradient triggers ATP
formation in ATP synthase enzyme situated
on the thylakoid membrane. Photosystem
I need light of longer wave length (> P700
nm). It operates under low light intensity, less
CO 2 and under anaerobic conditions which
makes it considered as earlier in evolution
(Figure 13.13)

![](/books/biology/unit-5/photosynthesis/18.png)<br>
**Figure 13.13:** Cyclic Photophosphorylation 

#### 13.10.2 Non-Cyclic Photophosphorylation 

When photons are activated reaction centre
of pigment system II(P680), electrons moved
to the high energy level. Electrons from high
energy state passes through series of electron
carriers like pheophytin, plastoquinone,
cytochrome complex, plastocyanin and
finally accepted by PS I (P700). During this
movement of electrons from PS II to PS I ATP
is generated (Figure 13. 16). PS I (P700) is
activated by light, electrons are moved to high
energy state and accepted by electron acceptor
molecule ferredoxin reducing Substance
(FRS). During the downhill movement
through ferredoxin, electrons are transferred
to NADP+ and reduced into NADPH + H +
(H+ formed from splitting of water by light).
Electrons released from the photosystem II
are not cycled back. It is used for the reduction
of NADP+ in to NADPH + H+. During the
electron transport it generates ATP and hence
this type of photophosphorylation is called
**non-cyclic photophosphorylation.** The
electron flow looks like the appearance of
letter ‘Z’ and so known as **Z scheme**. When
there is availability of NADP 1 for reduction
and when there is splitting of water molecules
both PS I and PS II are activated (Table 13.3).

**Figure 13.14:** Non-Cyclic Photophosphorylation <br>

#### 13.10.3 Bio energetics of light reaction

• To release one electron from pigment
system it requires two quanta of light.<br>
• One quantum is used for transport of electron from
water to PS I.<br>
• Second quantum is Second quantum is of electron from 
PS I to NADP+.<br>
• Two electrons are required to generate
one NADPH + H+ .<br>

**table**

• During Non-Cyclic electron transport
two NADPH 1 H 1 are produced and it
requires 4 electrons.<br>
• Transportation of 4 electrons requires
8 quanta of light.<br>

#### 13.10.4 Chemiosmotic Theory

Chemiosmosis theory was proposed by **P.
Mitchell (1966).** According to this theory
electrons are transported along the membrane
through PS I and PS II and connected by Cyto-
chrome b6-f complex. The flow of electrical
current is due to difference in electrochemical
potential of protons across the membrane.
Splitting of water molecule takes place inside the
membrane. Protons or H+ ions accumulate within
the lumen of the thylakoid (H+ increase 1000 to
2000 times). As a result, proton concentration
is increased inside the thylakoid lumen. These
protons move across the membrane because
the primary acceptor of electron is located
outside the membrane. Protons in stroma less
in number and creates a proton gradient. This
gradient is broken down due to the movement
of proton across the membrane to the stroma
through CF O of the ATP synthase enzyme. The
proton motive force created inside the lumen of
thylakoid or chemical gradient of H+ ion across
the membrane stimulates ATP generation
(Figure 13.15).<br>

The evolution of one oxygen molecule
(4 electrons required) requires 8 quanta of light.
C 3 plants utilise 3ATPs and 2NADPH + H +
to evolve one Oxygen molecule. To evolve 6
molecules of Oxygen 18ATPs and 12NADPH
+ H+ are utilised. C4 plants utilise 5 ATPs and 2
NADPH + H+ to evolve one oxygen molecule.
To evolve 6 molecules of Oxygen 30 ATPs and
12 NADPH + H+ are utilised.

#### 13.11 Dark Reaction or C3 Cycle or Biosynthetic Phase or Photosynthetic<br>
#### Carbon Reduction (PCR)Cycle <br>
Biosynthetic phase of photosynthesis utilises
assimilatory powers(ATP and NADPH + H+ )
produced during light reaction are used to fix
and reduce carbon di oxide into carbohydrates.
This reaction does not require light. Therefore,
it is named Dark reaction. Ribulose 1,5
bisphosphate (RUBP) act as acceptor molecule
of carbon di oxide and fix the CO2 by RUBISCO
enzyme. The first product of the pathway is
a 3- carbon compound (Phospho Glyceric
Acid) and so it is also called as C 3 Cycle. It
takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast.
**M. Melvin Calvin**, **A.A. Benson** and
their co-workers in the year 1957 found
this path way of carbon fixation. Melvin
Calvin was awarded Nobel Prize for this
in 1961 and this pathway named after
the discoverers as **Calvin-Benson** Cycle.
Dark reaction is temperature dependent
and so it is also called thermo-chemical
reaction.

What will be the quanta requirement for complete
light reaction which releases 6 oxygen molecules?<br>
**Solution:** Complete light reaction releases 6
oxygen molecules. If one molecule of oxygen
evolution requires 8 quanta means, for 6 oxygen
molecules 6 × 85 =48 quanta of light required
for complete light reaction.
{{</box>}}<br>
Dark reaction consists of three phases:
(Figure 13.16). <br>
1. Carboxylation (fixation)<br>
2. Reduction (Glycolytic Reversal)<br>
3. Regeneration<br>
   
#### Phase 1- Carboxylation (Fixation)

Bisphosphate (RUBP) a 5 carbon compound

**Figure 13.16:** Phases of Calvin Cycle <br>
with the help of RUBP carboxylase
oxygenase (RUBISCO) enzyme accepts
one molecule of carbon dioxide to form
an unstable 6 carbon compound. This 6C
compound is broken down into two molecules
of 3-carbon compound phospho glyceric acid
(PGA) (Figure 13.17).<br>
RUBP + CO2 ---Rubisco--->  2 molecules PGA

**Figure 13.17:** Calvin cycle<br>

#### Phase 2 – Glycolytic Reversal / Reduction <br>
Phospho glyceric acid is phosphorylated by
ATP and produces 1,3 bis phospho glyceric
acid by PGA kinase. 1,3 bis phospho glyceric
acid is reduced to glyceraldehyde 3 Phosphate
(G-3-P) by using the reducing power NADPH + H+ . Glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate is converted
into its isomeric form di hydroxy acetone
phosphate (DHAP).<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/photosynthesis/23.png) <br>
#### Phase 3 – Regeneration <br>
Regeneration of RUBP involves the formation
of several intermediate compounds of 6-carbon,
5-carbon,4-carbon and 7- carbon skeleton.
Fixation of one carbon dioxide requires 3 ATPs
and 2 NADPH + H+ , and for the fixation of 6
CO2 requires 18 ATPs and 12 NADPH + H+
during C3 cycle. One 6 carbon compound is the
net gain to form hexose sugar. <br>

Carboxylase
Oxygenase
enzyme, is the most abundant
protein found on earth. It
constitutes 16% of the chloroplast protein.
It acts as carboxylase in the presence of CO2
and oxygenase in the absence of CO2

#### 13.12 Hatch & Slack Pathway or C4 Cycle or Dicarboxylic Acid Pathway or <br>
#### Dicarboxylation Pathway <br>
Till 1965, Calvin cycle is the only pathway for
CO 2 fixation. But in 1965, **Kortschak, Hart**
and **Burr** made observations in sugarcane
and found C 4 or dicarboxylic acid pathway.
Malate and aspartate are the major labelled
products. This observation was confirmed
by Hatch & Slack in 1967. This alternate
pathway for the fixation of CO 2 was found in
several tropical and sub-tropical grasses and
some dicots. C 4 cycle is discovered in more
than 1000 species. Among them 300 species
belong to dicots and rest of them are
monocots. C 4 plants represent about 5% of
Earth’s plant biomass and 1% of its known
plant species. Despite this scarcity, they
account for about 30% of terrestrial carbon
fixation. Increasing the proportion of C 4
plants on earth could assist biosequestration
of CO 2 and represent an important climate
change avoidance strategy.
C 4 pathway is completed in two
phases, first phase takes place in stroma of
mesophyll cells, where the CO 2 acceptor
molecule is 3-Carbon compound, phospho
enol pyruvate (PEP) to form 4-carbon Oxalo
acetic acid (OAA). The first product is a
4-carbon and so it is named as C 4 cycle. oxalo
acetic acid is a dicarboxylic acid and hence
this cycle is also known as dicarboxylic
acid pathway (Figure 13.18). Carbon
dioxide fixation takes place in two places
one in mesophyll and another in bundle
sheath cell (di carboxylation pathway). It is
the adaptation of tropical and sub tropical
plants growing in warm and dry conditions.
Fixation of CO 2 with minimal loss is due
to absence of photorespiration. C 4 plants
require 5 ATP and 2 NADPH + H+ to fix
one molecule of CO 2 .<br>

through plasmodesmata.

#### 13.12.2 Stage: II Bundle Sheath Cells <br>
Malic acid undergoes decarboxylation and
produces a 3 carbon compound Pyruvic acid
and CO 2 . The released CO 2 combines with
RUBP and follows the calvin cycle and finally
sugar is released to the phloem. Pyruvic acid is
transported to the mesophyll cells.<br>

**Kranz Anatomy:** It is the
German term meaning
a halo or wreath. In C4
plants vascular bundles are
surrounded by a layer of
bundle sheath. Bundle sheath is surrounded
by a ring of mesophyll cells. The characteristic
feature of C4 plants is the presence of dimorphic
chloroplast:
*Bundle sheath chloroplast:* Larger chloroplast,
thylakoids not arranged in granum and rich in
starch.
*Mesophyll Chloroplast:* Smaller chloroplast,
thylakoids arranged in granum and less starch.
{{</box>}}<br>

#### 13.12.3 Significance of C 4 cycle <br>
1.Plants having C4 cycle are mainly of tropical
and sub-tropical regions and are able to
survive in environment with low CO2
concentration.<br>
2.C4 plants are partially adapted to drought
conditions.<br>
3.Oxygen has no inhibitory effect on C4 cycle
since PEP carboxylase is insensitive to O2 .<br>
4.Due to absence of photorespiration, CO2
Compensation Point for C4 is lower than
that of C3 plants.<br>
Differences between C3 Plants (C  Cycle) and
C4 Plants (C4 Cycle) are given in table 13.4.

**Table**

{{<box title="">}}
**Check your grasp!** <br>
C4 plants requires 30 ATPs and 12 NADPH + H+ to synthesize one glucose, but C3 plants
requires only 18 ATPs and 12 NADPH + H+ to synthesize one glucose molecule. If
then, how can you say C4 plants are more
advantageous?<br>
**Solution:** C4 plants are more advantageous
than C3 plants because most of the energy
lost during photo respiration in C3 plants.

#### 13.13 Crassulacean Acid Metabolism or CAM cycle <br>
It is one of the carbon pathways identified
in succulent plants growing in semi-arid or
xerophytic condition. This was first observed
in crassulaceae family plants like *Bryophyllum*,
*Sedum*, *Kalanchoe* and is the reason behind
the name of this cycle. It is also noticed in
plants from other families Examples: *Agave*,
*Opuntia*, Pineapple and Orchids. The stomata
are closed during day and are open during
night (*Scotoactive*). This reverse stomatal
rhythm helps to conserve water loss through
transpiration and will stop the fixation of CO 2
during the day time. At night time CAM plants
fix CO 2 with the help of Phospho Enol Pyruvic
acid (PEP) and produce oxalo acetic acid
(OAA). Subsequently OAA is converted into
malic acid like C 4 cycle and gets accumulated
in vacuole increasing the acidity. During the
day time stomata are closed and malic acid is
decarboxylated into pyruvic acid resulting in
the decrease of acidity. CO 2 thus formed enters
into Calvin Cycle and produces carbohydrates
(Figure13.19).<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/photosynthesis/27.png) <br>
**Figure 13.19:** CAM cycle <br>

#### 13.14 Photorespiration or C2 Cycle or Photosynthetic Carbon Oxidation (PCO) Cycle <br>
Respiration is a continuous process for all
living organisms including plants. **Decker**
(1959) observed that rate of respiration is
more in light than in dark. Photorespiration
is the excess respiration taking place in
photosynthetic cells due to absence of CO 2
and increase of O 2 (Table 13.5). This condition
changes the carboxylase role of RUBISCO into
oxygenase. C 2 Cycle takes place in chloroplast,
peroxisome and mitochondria. RUBP is
converted into PGA and a 2C-compound
phosphoglycolate by Rubisco enzyme
in chloroplast. Since the first product is a
2C-compound, this cycle is known as C 2
**Cycle.** Phosphoglycolate by loss of phosphate
becomes glycolate. Glycolate formed in
chloroplast enters into peroxisome to form
glyoxylate and hydrogen peroxide. Glyoxylate
is converted into glycine and transferred
into mitochondria. In mitochondria, two
molecules of glycine combine to form serine.
Serine enters into peroxisome to form
hydroxy pyruvate. Hydroxy pyruvate with
help of NADH 1 H 1 becomes glyceric acid.
Glyceric acid is cycled back to chloroplast
util ising ATP and becomes Phosphoglyceric
acid (PGA) and enters into the Calvin cycle
(PCR cycle). Photorespiration does not yield
any free energy in the form of ATP. Under
certain conditions 50% of the photosynthetic
potential is lost because of Photorespiration
(Figure 13.20). <br>
#### 13.15.1 Significance of photorespiration <br>
1. Glycine and Serine synthesised during
this process are precursors of many
biomolecules like chlorophyll, proteins,
nucleotides.<br>
2. It consumes excess NADH + H+ generated.<br>
3. Glycolate protects cells from Photo
oxidation.<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/photosynthesis/28.png) <br>
**Figure 13.20:** Photorespiration <br>
#### 13.15.2 Carbon Dioxide Compensation Point <br>
When the rate of photosynthesis equals
the rate of respiration, there is no exchange
of oxygen and carbon dioxide and this is
called as carbon dioxide **compensation**
**point.** This will happen at particular light
intensity when exchange of gases becomes
zero. When light is not a limiting factor and
atmospheric CO 2 concentration is between
50 to 100 ppm the net exchange is zero.
13.15 Factors affecting ­Photosynthesis
In 1860, Sachs gave three cardinal points
theory explaining minimum, optimum and
maximum factors that control photosynthesis.<br>
#### 13.15 Factors affecting ­Photosynthesis <br>
In 1860, Sachs gave three cardinal points
theory explaining minimum, optimum and
maximum factors that control photosynthesis.

**Table**  

In 1905, **Blackman** put forth the importance
of smallest factor. **Blackman’s law of limiting**
**factor** is actually a modified Law proposed
by **Liebig’s Law of minimum**. According to
Blackman, “*When a process is conditioned
as to its rapidity by a number of separate
factors, the rate of the process is limited by
the pace of the lowest factor”. To conclude in
an easy way “at any given point of time the
lowest factor among essentials will limit the
rate of photosynthesis”.* For example, when
even sufficient light intensity is available,
photosynthesis may be low due to low CO2 in
the atmosphere. Here, CO2 acts as a limiting
factor. If CO2 is increased in the atmosphere
the rate of photosynthesis also increases.
Further increase in photosynthesis is possible
only if the available light intensity is also
increased proportionately (Figure 13.21).
Factors affecting photosynthesis are further
grouped into External or Environmental
factors and Internal factors.<br>
**I. External factors:** Light, carbon dioxide,
temperature, water, mineral and pollutants.<br>
**II. Internal factors:** Pigments, protoplasmic
factor, accumulation of carbohydrates,
anatomy of leaf and hormones.<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/photosynthesis/29.png) <br>
**Figure 13.21:** Blackman’s Law of Limiting Factors <br>
#### 13.15.1. External factors <br>
**1. Light** <br>
Energy for photosynthesis comes only from
light. Photooxidation of water and excitation
of pigment molecules are directly controlled by
light. Stomatal movement leading to diffusion
of CO 2 is indirectly controlled by light. <br>
**a. Intensity of Light:** <br>
Intensity of light plays a direct role in the
rate of photosynthesis. Under low intensity
the photosynthetic rate is low and at higher
intensity photosynthetic rate is higher. It also
depends on the nature of plants. Heliophytes
(Bean Plant) require higher intensity than
Sciophytes (*Oxalis*). <br>
**b. Quantity of Light:** <br>
In plants which are exposed to light for longer
duration (Long day Plants) photosynthetic rate
is higher.<br>
**c. Quality of light:** <br>
Different wavelengths of light affect the rate of
photosynthesis because pigment system does
not absorb all the rays equally. Photosynthetic
rate is maximum in blue and red light.
**Photosynthetically Active Radiation** (PAR)
is between 400 to 700 nm. Red light induces
highest rate of photosynthesis and green light
induces lowest rate of photosynthesis. <br>
**2. Carbon dioxide** <br>
CO2 is found only 0.3 % in the atmosphere but
plays a vital role. Increase in concentration of
CO2 increases the rate of photosynthesis (CO2
concentration in the atmosphere is 330 ppm).
If concentration is increased beyond 500ppm,
rate of photosynthesis will be affected showing
the inhibitory effect.<br>
**3. Oxygen** <br>
The rate of photosynthesis decreases when
there is an increase of oxygen concentration.
This Inhibitory effect of oxygen was first
discovered by **Warburg** (1920) using green
algae Chlorella.<br>
**4.Temperature**<br>
The optimum temperature for photosynthesis
varies from plant to plant. Temperature is not
uniform in all places. In general, the *optimum*
temperature for photosynthesis is 25 o C to
35 o C. This is not applicable for all plants. The
ideal temperature for plants like Opuntia is
55 o C, Lichens 20 o C and Algae growing in hot
spring photosynthesis is 75 o C. Whether high
temperature or low temperature it will close
the stomata as well as inactivate the enzymes
responsible for photosynthesis (Figure 13.22).<br>

![](/books/biology/unit-5/photosynthesis/30.png) <br>
**Figure 13.22:** Factors affecting Photosynthesis <br>

**5. Water** <br>
Photolysis of water provides electrons and
protons for the reduction of NADP, directly.
Indirect roles are stomatal movement and
hydration of protoplasm. During water stress,
supply of NADPH 1 H 1 is affected.<br>
**6. Minerals**<br>
Deficiency of certain minerals affect
photosynthesis e.g. mineral involved in the
synthesis of chlorophyll (Mg, Fe and N),
Phosphorylation reactions (P), Photolysis
of water (Mn and Cl), formation of
plastocyanin (Cu). <br>
#### 13.15.2 Internal Factors <br>
**1. Photosynthetic Pigments** <br>
It is an essential factor and even a small quantity
is enough to carry out photosynthesis.<br>
**2. Protoplasmic factor** <br>
Hydrated protoplasm is essential for
photosynthesis. It also includes enzymes
responsible for Photosynthesis.<br>
**3. Accumulation of Carbohydrates**<br>
Photosynthetic end products like carbohydrates
are accumulated in cells and if translocation of
carbohydrates is slow then this will affect the
rate of photosynthesis. <br>
**4. Anatomy of leaf** <br>
Thickness of cuticle and epidermis,
distribution of stomata, presence or absence
of Kranz anatomy and relative proportion of
photosynthetic cells affect photosynthesis. <br>
**5. Hormones** <br>
Hormones like gibberellins and cytokinin
increase the rate of photosynthesis. <br>
#### 13.16 Photosynthesis in bacteria <br> 
Though we study about bacterial
photosynthesis as the last part, bacterial
photosynthesis formed first and foremost
in evolution. Bacteria does not have
specialized structures like chloroplast. It has
a simple type of photosynthetic apparatus
called chlorosomes and chromatophores
(Table 13.6). **Van Neil** (1930) discovered
a bacterium that releases sulphur instead
of oxygen during photosynthesis. Here,
electron donor is hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S)
and only one photosystem is involved (PS I)
and the reaction centre is P 870 . Pigments
present in bacteria are bacteriochlorophyll
a, b, c, d, e and g and carotenoids.
Photosynthetic bacteria are classified into
three groups:<br>
1.Green sulphur bacteria.<br> **Example:**
*Chlorobacterium* and *Chlorobium*. <br>
**table** <br>
2.Purple sulphur bacteria. <br>
**Example:**<br>
*Thiospirillum* and *Chromatium*.
3.Purple non-sulphur bacteria. <br>
**Example:**<br>
*Rhodopseudomonas* and *Rhodospirillum*.<br>

#### Summary <br>
Photosynthesis is an oxidation and reduction
process. It has two phases: the light reaction
and dark reaction. During light reaction
water is oxidised to release O2 and during
dark reaction CO2 is reduced to form sugars.
Solar energy is trapped by pigment system
I and pigment system II. P700 and P680
act as reaction centres for PS I and PS II
respectively. Splitting of water molecule
(Photolysis) produces electrons, protons and
oxygen. Photophosphorylation takes place
through cyclic and non-cyclic mechanisms
and generates energy and reducing power.
Dark reaction or biosynthetic phase of
photosynthesis use the products of light
energy (ATP and NADPH + H+ ) and
carbon dioxide is reduced to Carbohydrates.
Carbon pathway in C 3 cycle has RUBP as
the acceptor molecule and the first product
is PGA (3C). Carbon pathway in C 4 plants
involves mesophyll and bundle sheath cells,
Kranz anatomy. Dimorphic chloroplast, no
photorespiration, acceptor molecule as PEP
and first product as OAA (4C) are some of
the unique characters of C4 cycle. C2 Cycle
or photorespiration is operated when less
amount of CO2 is used for reduction and O2
increases. Rubisco starts to play oxygenase
role. Succulent and xerophytic plants show
reverse stomatal rhythm as they open during
night time and close during day time and
follow CAM cycle. Night time produces
malic acid and during day time malate
is converted into pyruvate and produces
CO 2 which is reduced to carbohydrates.
Photosynthesis is affected by
internal and external factors.
Bacterial photosynthesis is the primitive type of
photosynthesis and it involves only photosystem I.
