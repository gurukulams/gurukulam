Flowers have been a universal cultural
object for millennia. They are an important
aesthetic element in everyday life, and have
played a highly symbolic role in our culture
throughout the ages. Exchange of flowers
marks respect, affection, happiness, and love.
However, the biological purpose of the flower
is very different from the way we use and
perceive. Flower helps a plant to reproduce
its own kind. This chapter discusses flowers,
their arrangement, fruits and seeds which are
the reproductive units of a plant.



{{< box title="Floriculture" type="objective" >}}

Floriculture is a branch of Horticulture.
It deals with the cultivation of flowers
and ornamental crops. The Government
of India has identified floriculture as a
sunrise industry and accorded the status
of 100% export oriented. Agriculture
and Processed Food Product Export
Development Authority (APEDA) is
responsible for export promotion of
agricultural and horticultural products
from India.

##### 4.1 Inflorescence

Have you seen a bouquet being used during
functions? Group of flowers arranged
together on our preference is a bouquet. But
an inflorescence is a group of flowers arising
from a branched or unbranched axis with a
definite pattern. Function of inflorescence
is to display the flowers for effective
pollination and facilitate seed dispersal. The
grouping of flowers in one place gives a better
attraction to the visiting pollinators and
maximize the energy of the plant.


##### 4.1.1 Types of Inflorescence

**Based On Position**

Have you ever noticed the inflorescence
arising from different positions? Where is the
inflorescence present in a plant? Apex or axil?


Based on position of inflorescences, it may
be classified into three major types. They are,

**Terminal**: Inflorescence grows as a
part of the terminal shoot. Example: Raceme
of *Nerium oleander*

**Axillary**: Inflorescence presents in the
axile of the nearest vegetative leaf. Example:
*Hibiscus rosa-sinensis*

**Cauliflorous**: Inflorescence developed di­
rectly from a woody trunk. Example: *Theobro*-
*ma cocoa*, *Couraupita guinensis*

Observe the inflorescence of Jackfruit and
Canon ball tree. Where does it arise?


##### 4.1.2 Based on branching pattern and other characters

Inflorescence may also be classified based
on branching, number and arrangement of
flowers, and some specialized structures.

I. **Indeterminate** (**Racemose**)

II. **Determinate** (**Cymose**)

III. **Mixed inflorescence**: Inflorescence
of some plants show a combination of
indeterminate and determinate pattern

IV. **Special inflorescence**: Inflorescence
which do not confine to these patterns



![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.1.eng.png )





| **Racemose** 	| **Cymose** 	|
|---	|---	|
| Main axis of<br>unlimited growth 	| Main axis of limited<br>growth. 	|
| Flowers arranged<br>in an acropetal<br>succession 	| Flowers arranged<br>in a basipetal<br>succession 	|
| Opening of flowers<br>is centripetal 	| Opening of flowers<br>is centrifugal 	|
| Usually the oldest<br>flower at the base<br>of the inflorescence<br>axis 	| Usually the oldest<br>flower at the top of<br>the inflorescence<br>axis. 	|






**I. Racemose**

The central axis of the inflorescence
(peduncle) possesses terminal bud which
is capable of growing continuously and
produce lateral flowers is called **Racemose**
**inflorescence**. Old flowers are at the base
and younger flowers and buds are towards
the apex. It is further divided into 3 types
based on growth pattern of main axis.



![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.2.eng.png )



**1. Main axis elongated**

The axis of inflorescence is elongated and
contains pedicellate or sessile flowers on it. The
following types are discussed under main axis
elongated type.

**a. Simple raceme**: The inflorescence with
an unbranched main axis bears **pedicellate**
**flowers** in acropetal succession. Example:
*Crotalaria retusa, Mustard*.

**b. Spike**: Spike is an unbranched
indeterminate inflorescence with **sessile**
**flowers**. Example: *Achyranthes*.


**c. Spikelet**: Literally it is a small spike.
The Inflorescence is with branched central
axis. Each branch is a **spikelet**. Sessile flowers
are formed in acropetal succession on the axis.
A pair of inflorescence bracts called **glumes** is
present at the base. Each sessile flower has a
**lemma** (bract) and a **palea** (bracteole). Tepals
reduced to colourless scaly leaves (lodicule).
Each flower has stamen and pistil only.
Example: Paddy, Wheat.

**d. Catkin**: **Pendulous spikes** with a long
and drooping axis bearing small unisexual
or bisexual flowers. It is also called **ament**.
Example: *Acalypha hispida, Prosopis juliflora*.

**e. Spadix**: An inflorescence with a fleshy
or thickened central axis that possesses many
unisexual sessile flowers in acropetal succession.
Usually female flowers are found towards the
base and male flowers are found at the apex.
Entire inflorescence is covered by a brightly
coloured or hard bract called a **spathe**. Example:
*Amorphophallus, Colocasia*.

**f. Panicle**: A branched raceme is called
**panicle**. Example: *Mangifera*, neem. It is also
called **Compound raceme** or **Raceme of**
**Racemes**.




![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.3.eng.png )


**2. Main axis shortened**:

Inflorescence with reduced growth of central
axis. There are two types, namely corymb and
umbel.

**a. Corymb**: An inflorescence with shorter
pedicellate flowers at the top and longer
pedicellate flowers at the bottom. All flowers
appear at the same level to form convex or
flat topped racemose inflorescence. Example:
*Caesalpinia*. **Compound corymb**: A branched
corymb is called **Compound corymb**.
Example: Cauliflower.

**b. Umbel**: An inflorescence with
indeterminate central axis and pedicellate
flowers arise from a common point of peduncle
at the apex. Example: *Allium cepa*. **Compound**
**umbel**: It is a branched umbel. Each smaller
unit is called **umbellule**.Example: *Daucas*
*carota, Coriandrum sativum*.


**3. Main axis flattened**:
The main axis of inflorescence is mostly
flattened (convex or concav) or globose. A **head**
or **capitulum** is determinate or indeterminate,
group of sessile or sub sessile flowers arising on
a receptacle, often subtended by an involucre.

**a. Head**: A head is a characteristic
inflorescence of Asteraceae and is also found in
some members of Rubiaceae and Mimosaceae.

Torus contains two types of florets:
1. Disc floret or tubular floret. 2. Ray floret
or ligulate floret. Based on the type of florets
present, the heads are classified into two types.

**i. Homogamous head**: This type of
inflorescence exhibits single kind of florets.
Inflorescence has disc florets alone. Example:
Vernonia, Ray florets alone. Example: *Launaea.*


**ii. Heterogamous head**: The inflorescence
possesses both types of florets. Example:
*Helianthus, Tridax*.


**Disc florets** at the centre of the head are
tubular and bisexual, whereas the **ray florets**
found at the margin of the head which are
ligulate and pistilate (unisexual).


{{< box title="" type="objective" >}}

The flower and inflorescence are
subtended by a lateral appendage called
bract. In sunflower, you may notice that the
whorl of bracts forms a cup like structure
beneath mimicking the calyx. Such whorl
of bracts is called involucre. A group of
bracts present beneath the sub unit of
inflorescence is known as Involucre.

##### II. Cymose inflorescence.

Central axis stops growing and ends in a
flower, further growth is by means of axillary
buds. Old flowers present at apex and young
flowers at base



![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.4.eng.png )





**1. Simple cyme (solitary)**: Determinate
inflorescence consists of a single flower. It may
be terminal or axillary. Example: terminal in
*Trillium grandiflorum* and axillary in *Hibiscus*.

**2. Monochasial Cyme (uniparous)**: The
main axis ends with a flower. From two lateral
bracts, only one branch grows further. It may
be **Helicoid** or **Scorpioid**.





![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.5.eng.png )




**a. Helicoid**: Axis develops on only one side
and forms a coil structure atleast at the earlier
development stage. Example: *Hamelia*, potato.


**b. Scorpioid**: Axis develops on alternate
sides and often becomes a coiled structure.
Example: *Heliotropium*


**3. Simple dichasium (Biparous)**: A central
axis ends in a terminal flower; further growth
is produced by two lateral buds. Each cymose
unit consists of three flowers of which central
one is old one. This is **true cyme**. Example:
*Jasminum*.

**4. Compound dichasium**: It has many flowers.
A terminal old flower develops lateral simple
dichasial cymes on both sides. Each compound
dichasium consists of seven flowers. Example:
*Clerodendron*.

A small,simple dichasium is called **cymule**

**5. Polychasial Cyme (multiparous)**: The
central axis ends with a flower. The lateral axis
branches repeatedly. Example: *Nerium*


{{< box title="**Sympodial Cyme**">}}
In monochasial cyme,
successive axis at first
develop in a zigzag
manner and later it
develops into a straight
pseudo axis. Example:
Solanum americanum.

![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Figext1.eng.png )

{{</box>}}



**III. Mixed Inflorescence**

Inflorescences in which both racemose
and cymose patterns of development occur
in a mixed manner. It is of the following
two types.

**1. Thyrsus**: It is a ‘**Raceme of cymes**’.
Indefinite central axis bears lateral
pedicellate cymes, (simple or compound
dichasia). Example: *Ocimum*.


**2. Verticillaster**: Main axis bears two
opposite lateral sessile cymes at the axil of
the node,each of it produces monochasial
scorpioid lateral branches so that flowers
are crowded around the node. Example:
*Leucas*.


![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.6.eng.png )




![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.7.eng.png )



#### IV. Special Inflorescence


The inflorescence that do not show any of the
development pattern types are classified under
special type of inflorescence.


**1. Cyathium**: Cyathium inflorescence consists
of small unisexual flowers enclosed by a
common involucre which mimics a single
flower. Male flowers are organised in a scorpioid
manner. Female flower is solitary and centrally
located on a long pedicel. Male flower is
represented only by stamens and female flower
is represented only by a pistil. Cyathium may
be actinomorphic (Example: *Euphorbia*) or
zygomorphic (Example: *Pedilanthus*). Nectar
is present in involucre.





![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.8.eng.png )






![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.9.eng.png )




**2. Hypanthodium**: Receptacle is a hollow,
globose structure consisting of unisexual
flowers present on the inner wall of the
receptacle. Receptacle is closed leaving a small
opening called **ostiole** which is covered by a
series of bracts. Male flowers are present nearer
to the ostiole, female and neutral flowers are
found in a mixed manner from middle below.
Example: *Ficus sp*. (Banyan, Fig and Pipal)

**3. Coenanthium**: Circular disc like fleshy open
receptacle that bears pistillate flowers at the
center and staminate flowers at the periphery.
Example: *Dorstenia*  


##### 4.2 Flower

In a plant, which part would you like the most?
Of course, it is a flower, because of its colour
and fragrance. The flower is a significant
diagnostic feature of angiosperms. It is a
modified condensed reproductive shoot. The
flowers are present in the same plant
growth of the flower shoot is determinate.


##### 4.2.1 Whorls of flower

There are two whorls, accessory and essential.
Accessory whorl consists of calyx and corolla
and essential whorl comprises of androecium
and gynoecium.

Flower is said to be **Complete** when it
contains all four whorls. An **Incomplete** flower
is devoid of one or more whorls.

##### 4.2.2 Flower sex


**Flower sex** refers to the presence or
absence of androecium and gynoecium
within a flower.

**1. Perfect or bisexual**: If a flower contains
both androecium and gynoecium it is
called as a **perfect flower**.


**2. Imperfect or unisexual**: When the
flower contains only one of the essential
whorls is called **Imperfect flower**. It is of
two types:


i) **Staminate flowers**: Flowers with
androecium alone.

**ii) Pistillate flowers**: Flowers with
gynoecium alone.





![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.10.eng.png )



![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.11.eng.png )


##### 4.2.3 Plant sex

**Plant sex** refers to the presence and
distribution of flowers with different sexes in
an individual plant.

**1. Hermaphroditic**: All the flowers of the plant
are bisexual.

**2. Monoecious**: Both male and female
flowers are present in the same plant
Example: Coconut.

**3. Dioecious**: Male and Female flowers are
present on separate plants. Example: Papaya,
Palmyra.

**4. Polygamous**: The condition in which
bisexual and unisexual (staminate/pistillate)
flowers occur in a same plant is called
**polygamous**. Example: *Musa, Mangifera*.



##### 4.2.4 Flower symmetry

What is the radius of a circle? Cut a paper
into round shape, fold it so as to get two
equal halves. In how many planes will you
get equal halves? In how many planes you
can divide a cucumber in two equal halves? A
flower is symmetrical when it is divided into
equal halves in any plane running through
the center. Flower symmetry is an important
structural adaptation related to pollination
systems.


1. **Actinomorphic (or) radial or**
**polysymmetric**: The flower shows two
mirror images when cut in any plane or
radius through the centre.Normally there
are more than two planes of symmetry.
Example: *Hibiscus, Datura*.





![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.12.eng.png )



**2**. **Zygomorphic (bilateral symmetry)**
or **monosymmetric**: The flower can be
divided into 2 equal halves in only one
plane. Zygomorphic flower can efficiently
transfer pollen grains to visiting pollinators.
Example: *Pisum*, Bean.


**3. Asymmetric (amorphic)**: Flower lacks any
plane of symmetry and cannot be divided into
equal halves in any plane. Parts of such flowers
are twisted. Example: *Canna indica*.


##### 4.3 Accessory organs

##### 4.3.1 Arrangement of whorls

The position of perianth (sepals, petals,
tepals) parts relative to one another is called
**perianth arrangement**.

**1. Cyclic or whorled**: All the floral parts
are arranged in definite whorls. Example:
*Brassica*.


2. **Acyclic or spiral**: The floral parts are
arranged in spirals on the elongated fleshy
torus. Example: *Magnolia*.


3. **Spirocyclic or hemicyclic**: Some parts
are in whorls and others parts are in spirals.
Example:*Annona, Polyalthia*


##### 4.3.2 Calyx

Calyx protects the flower in bud stage.
Outermost whorl of flower is calyx.
Unit of calyx is sepal. Normally green in
colour.


**1. Fusion: a. Aposepalous** (polysepalous):
The flower with distinct sepals. Example:
*Brassica, Annona*.


**b. Synsepalous**: The flower with united
or fused sepals. Example: *Hibiscus*.


**2. Duration of floral parts**:

What is the green part of brinjal fruit? Have
you seen similar to this in any other fruits?


a. **Caducous or fugacious calyx**: Calyx
that withers or falls off during the early
development stage of flower. Example:
*Papaver*.




![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.13.eng.png )



**b. Deciduous**: Calyx that falls soon after
the opening of flower (anthesis) Example:
*Nelumbo*.




![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.13c.eng.png )



**c. Persistant**: Calyx that persists and
continues to be along with the fruit and forms
a cup at the base of the fruit. Example: Brinjal.


**d. Accrescent**: Calyx that is persistent,
grows along with the fruit and encloses the
fruit either completely or partially. Example:
*Physalis*.



![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.13d.eng.png )




**3. Shapes of calyx**


Have you noticed the shoe flower’s calyx? It is
bell shaped called **Campanulate**. The fruiting
calyx is urn shaped in *Withania* and it is called
**urceolate**. In *Datura calyx* is tube like and it is
known as **tubular**. Two lipped calyx is present
in *Ocimum*. Sometimes calyx is coloured
and called **petaloid**. Example: *Saraca* and
*Mussanda*. In Tridax, calyx is modified into
hair like structures are called pappus.





![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.14.eng.png )



##### 4.3.3 Corolla

Corolla is the most attractive part in majority
of the flowers and is usually brightly coloured.
Corolla helps to display the flower and attracts
the pollinators.

**1. Fusion**:
a. **Apopetalous (polypetalous)**: Petals are
distinct. Example: *­Hibiscus*.


b. **Sympetalous (gamopetalous)**: Petals
are fused. Example: ­ *Datura*.


##### 4.3.4 Perianth

Can you recall the term homochlamydeous?
Undifferentiated calyx and corolla in a flower
is called **perianth**. Each member is called
**tepal**. If the tepals are distinct they are called
**Apotepalous** (Polyphyllous). Example: *Allium*
*sativum*. Fused tepals are called **Syntepalous**.
(Gamophyllous). Example: *Allium cepa*


{{< box title="" type="objective" >}}

**Lodicule**: Reduced scale like perianth in
the members of Poaceae is called lodicule.

{{< /box >}}


##### 4.3.5 Aestivation: 
Arrangement of sepals and
petals in the flower bud is said to be aestivation.

![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.15.eng.png )

##### Essential Parts of Flower

##### 4.4 Androecium

**Androecium**:
Third whorl of flower is the male
reproductive part of the
flower. It is composed of
stamens(microsporophylls).
Each Stamen consist of 3
parts,


a. Filament b. Anther c. Connective





![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.16.eng.png )



**Anther: Upper swollen part with microsporangia**.

**Filament**: Stalk of stamen

**Connective**: Tissue connecting anther
lobes with filament


Anther typically contains two com­
partments called **thecae** (singular theca).Each
theca consists of two microsporangia.Two
microsporangia fused to form a **locule**.


Sterile stamens are called **Staminodes**.
Example: *Cassia*. **Distinct**: stamens which
do not fuse to one another. **Free**: stamens
which do not fuse with other parts of flower.
**Apostemonous**: flowers with stamens that are
free and distinct.

##### 4.4.1 Fusion of stamens: 
The fusion of
stamens fusing among themselves or with
other parts of flower. They are of two types.


**1. Connation and 2. Adnation**

**1. Connation**: Refers to the fusion of stamens
among themselves. It is of 3 types. **a**. Adelphy.
**b.** Syngenecious. **c**. Synandrous.

**a. Adelphy**: Filaments connate into one or
more bundles but anthers are free. It may be
the following types.

**1. Monadelphous**: Filaments of stamens
connate into a single bundle.Example:
Malvaceae (Chinarose, Cotton).

**2. Diadelphous**: Filaments of stamens
connate into two bundles. Example: *Fabaceae*
(*pea*) and *Clitoria*.


**3. Polyadelphous**: Filaments connate into
many bundles. Example: *Citrus, Bombax*


  **b. Syngenesious**: Anthers connate,
filaments free. Example: Asteraceae.

  **c. Synandrous**: Filaments and anthers
are completely fused. Example: *Coccinea*.

**2. Adnation**: Refers to the fusion of stamens
with other floral parts. **Epipetalous** : Stamens
are adnate to petals .Example: brinjal, *Datura*.

  **a. Episepalous**: stamens are adnate to
sepals. Example: *Grevillea* (Silver oak)

  **b. Epitepalous** (**epiphyllous**): stamens
are adnate to tepals. Example: *Asparagus*.

  **c. Gynostegium**:Connation product of
stamens and stigma is called **gynostegium**.
Example: *Calotropis* and Orchidaceae.

  **d. Pollinium**: Pollen grains are fused
together as a single mass Example: *Calotropis*


##### 4.4.2 Arrangement of stamens relate to length of stamens:

1. **Didynamous**: Four stamens of which
two with long filaments and two with short
filaments. Example: *Ocimum*


2. **Tetradynamous**: Six stamens of which
four with long filaments and two with short
filaments. Example: *Brassica*.






![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.17a.eng.png )




![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.17.eng.png )


![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.18.eng.png )


3. **Heterostemonous**: stamens are of
different lengths in the same flower.
Example: *Cassia*.

##### 4.4.3 Anther types

**1. Monothecal**: One lobe with two
microsporangia. They are kidney shaped in a
cross section. Example: Malvaceae

![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.19a.eng.png )

**2. Dithecal**: It is a typical type,having two
lobes with four microsporangia.They are
butterfly shaped in cross section. Example:
Solanaceae.

##### 4.4.4 Anther attachment

**1. Basifixed**:(Innate) Base of anther is
attached to the tip of filament. Example:
*Datura*.

**2. Dorsifixed**: Apex of filament is attached
to the dorsal side of the anther. Example:
*Hibiscus*.

**3. Versatile**: Filament is attached to the
anther at midpoint. Example: Grasses.

**4. Adnate**: Filament is continued from the
base to the apex of anther. Example: *Nelumbo*


![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.20.eng.png )



##### 4.5 Gynoecium

Gynoecium or pistil is the
female reproductive part of the flower.

A pistil consists of an
expanded basal portion called
the ovary, an elongated section
called a **style** and an apical
structure that receives pollen
called a **stigma**. Ovary with
stipe is called **stipitate ovary**.




![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.21.eng.png )



**Carpel:** They
are components of a gynoecium.
Gynoecium is made of one or
more carpels. Carpels may be distinct or connate.

##### 4.5.1 Number of carpel

| **Unicarpellary**<br>(monocarpellary)<br>Single carpel<br>Example: ­Fabaceae 	| **Bicarpellary**<br>Two carpels<br>Example: Rubiaceae 	|
|---	|---	|
| **Tricarpellary**<br>Three carpels<br>Example:Cucurbitaceae 	| **Tetracarpellary**<br>Four carpels<br>Example: Lamiaceae 	|
| **Multicarpellary**<br>Many carpels<br>Example: Nymphaeceae. 	|  	|







##### 4.5.2 Fusion of carpels

It is an important systematic character.
Apocarpous gynoecium is generally thought
to be ancestral condition in Angiosperms.


| Apocarpous<br>A pistil contains<br>two or more<br>distinct carpels.<br>Example: Annona. 	| Syncarpous<br>A pistil contains two<br>or more carpels which<br>are connate. Example:<br>Citrus, tomato. 	|
|---	|---	|








![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.22.eng.png )



##### 4.5.3 Number of locules

Ovary bears ovules on a specialized tissue called
**placenta**. A **septum** is a crosswall or partition
of ovary. The walls of ovary and septa form a
cavity called **locule**. Like that tetralocular and
pentalocular ovaries are present according to
the locule numbers four or five. More than
one locule ovaries are called **plurilocular**.


![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.23.eng.png )


##### 4.5.4 Extension of the condensed internode of the receptacle

**1. Anthophore**:The internodal elongation
between calyx and corolla. Example:
caryophyllaceae (*Silene conoidea*)




![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.24a.eng.png )



**2. Androphore**: The internodal elongation
between the corolla and androecium.
Example: *Grewia*




![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.24b.eng.png )


**3. Gynophore**: The internodal elongation
between androecium and gynoecium
Example: *Capparis*.

The unified internodal elongation between
corolla and androecium and androecium and
gynoecium. Example: *Gynandropsis*.



![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.24d.eng.png )


##### 4.5.5 Ovary position

The position or attachment of ovary relative to
the other floral parts. It may be classified into

**1. Superior ovary**: It is the ovary with the
sepals, petals and stamens attached at the base
of the ovary.

**2. Inferior ovary**:It is the ovary with the
sepals, petals and stamens attached at the apex
of the ovary.

**3. Half-inferior ovary**: It is the ovary with
the sepals, petals and stamens or hypanthium
attached near the middle of the ovary.




![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.25.eng.png )

It is with the placentae along the
margin of a unicarpellate ovary.
Example: *Fabaceae*.

![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Figbox2.eng.png )

**Superficial**

Ovules arise from the
surface of the septa.
Example:
*Nymphaeaceae*.

![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Figbox3.eng.png )

**Free-central**

It is with the placentae along the
column in a compound ovary
without septa.
Example:
*Caryophyllaceae, Dianthus, Primerose*.

##### 4.6 Construction of floral diagram and floral formula

A floral formula is a simple way to explain
the salient features of a flower. The floral
diagram is a representation of the cross
section of the flower. It represents floral
whorls arranged as viewed from above.
Floral diagram shows the number and
arrangement of bract, bracteoles and floral
parts, fusion, overlapping and placentation.

The branch that bears the flower is called
**mother axis**.

The side of the flower facing the mother
axis is called **posterior side**. The side facing
the bract is the anterior side.

The members of different floral whorls
are shown arranged in concentric rings.

Br : Bracteate.

Ebr : Ebracteate

Brl : Bracteolate

Ebrl : Ebracteolate

##### 4.7 Fruits

We know about several kinds of fruits, but by
botanical study we will be surprised to know
the types of fruits and how they are produced
by plants. Fruits are the products of pollination
and fertilization, usually containing seeds
inside. In common person's perspective a fruit
may be defined as an edible product of the
entire gynoecium and any floral part which
is sweet, juicy or fleshy, coloured, aromatic
and enclosing seeds. However the fruit is a
fertilized and ripened ovary. The branch of
horticulture that deals with the study of fruits
and their cultivation is called **pomology**.

##### 4.7.1 Structure of Fruit

Fruit has a fruit wall. It is otherwise called
**pericarp**. It is differentiated into outer
**epicarp**, middle **mesocarp** and inner
**endocarp**. The inner
part of the fruit is
occupied by the seed.

##### 4.7.2 Types of Fruit

Fruits are classified into
three types:

##### Simple Fruits


The fruits are derived
from a single ovary of a
flower Example: Mango,
Tomato. Simple fruits
are classified based on
the nature of pericarp as follows.


##### A. Fleshy Fruit

The fruits are derived
from single   pistil
where the pericarp is
fleshy, succulent and
differentiated
into epicarp, mesocarp and endocarp. It is
subdivided into the following.

![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.27.eng.png )


**a) Berry**: Fruit develops from bicarpellary or
multicarpellary, syncarpous ovary. Here the
epicarp is thin, the mesocarp and endocarp
remain undifferentiated. They form a pulp
in which the seeds are embedded. Example:
Tomato, Grapes, Brinjal.


**b) Drupe**: Fruit
develops from monocarpellary, superior ovary. It is usually
one seeded. Pericarp is differentiated into
outer skinny epicarp, fleshy and pulpy
mesocarp and hard and stony endocarp
around the seed. Example: Mango, Coconut

**c) Pepo**: Fruit develops from tricarpellary
inferior ovary. Pericarp turns leathery or woody
which encloses, fleshy mesocarp and smooth
endocarp. Example: Cucumber, Watermelon,
Bottle gourd, Pumpkin.


**d) Hesperidium**: Fruit develops from
multicarpellary, multilocular, syncarpous,
superior ovary. The fruit wall is differentiated
into leathery epicarp with oil glands, a middle
fibrous mesocarp. The endocarp forms distinct
chambers, containing juicy hairs. Example:
Orange, Lemon.


**e) Pome**: It develops from multicarpellary,
syncarpous, inferior ovary. The receptacle
also develops along with the ovary and
becomes fleshy, enclosing the true fruit.
In pome the epicarp is thin skin like
and endocarp is cartilagenous. Example:
Apple, Pear.



![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.28.eng.png )

**f) Balausta**:
A
fleshy
indehiscent
fruit developing from multicarpellary,
multilocular inferior ovary whose pericarp
is tough and leathery. Seeds are attached
irregularly with testa being the edible
portion. Example: Pomegranate.

##### B. Dry Fruit


They develop from single ovary where the
pericarp is dry and not differentiated into
epicarp, mesocarp and endocarp. It is further
subdivided into three types.

**1) Dry dehiscent fruit**

Pericarp is dry and splits open
along the sutures to liberate seeds.
They can be classified into following types.

**a) Follicle**: Fruit develops from mono-
carpellary, superior ovary and dehisces along
one suture. Example: *Calotropis*.

**b) Legume or pod**: Fruit develops from
monocarpellary, superior ovary and dehisces
through both dorsal and ventral sutures.
Example: *Pisum*.

**c) Siliqua**:
Fruit
develops
from
bicarpellary, syncarpous, superior ovary
initially one chambered but subsequently
becomes two chambered due to the formation
of false septum (**replum**). The fruit dehisces
along two suture. Example: *Brassica*.


**d) Silicula**: Fruit similar to siliqua but
shorter and broader. Example: *Capsella*.

**e) Capsule**: Fruit develops from
multicarpellary, syncarpous, superior ovary.
Based on the dehiscence pattern they are
divided into

**i) Septicidal**: Capsule splitting along septa
and valves remaining attached to septa.
Example: *Aristolochia*.




![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.29.eng.png )



**ii) Loculicidal**: Capsule splitting along
locules and valves remaining attached to septa.
Example: *Abelmoschus*.

**iii) Poricidal**: Dehiscence through terminal
pores. Example: *Papaver*.

**2) Dry indehiscent fruit**
Dry fruit which does not split open at maturity.
It is subdivided into.

**a) Achene**: Single seeded dry fruit
developing from single carpel with superior
ovary. Achenes commonly develop from
apocarpous pistil, Fruit wall is free from
seed coat. Example: *Clematis, Delphinium*.

**b) Cypsela**: Single seeded dry fruit,
develops from bicarpellary, syncarpous,
inferior ovary with reduced scales, hairy or
feathery calyx lobes. Example: *Tridax*.

**c) Caryopsis**: It is a one seeded fruit
which develops from a monocarpellary
superior ovary. Pericarp is inseparably fused
with seed. Example: *Oryza*


![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.30.eng.png )



**d) Nut**: They develop from mulicarpellary,
syncarpous, superior ovary with hard, woody
or bony pericap. It is a one seeded fruit.
Example: *Anacardium*.

**e) Samara**: A dry indehiscent, one
seeded fruit in which the pericarp devlops
into thin winged structure around the fruit.
Example: *Acer*


**f) Utricle**:
They
develop
from
bicarpellary, unilocular, syncarpus, superior
ovary with pericarp loosely enclosing the
seeds. Example: *Chenopodium*


**3) Schizocarpic Fruit**


This fruit type is intermediate between
dehiscent and indehiscent fruit. The fruit
instead of dehiscing, splits into number of
segments, each containing one or more seeds.
They are of following types.




![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.31.eng.png )


**a) Cremocarp**: Fruit develops from
bicarpellary, syncarpous, inferior ovary and
splitting into two one seeded segments known
as **mericarps**. Example: Coriander.

**b) Carcerulus**: Fruit develops from
bicarpellary, syncarpous, superior ovary
and splitting into four one seeded segments
known as **nutlets**. Example: *Leucas*


**c) Lomentum**: The fruit is derived
from monocarpellary, unilocular ovary.
A leguminous fruit, constricted between
the seeds to form a number of one seeded
compartments that separate at maturity.
Example: *Mimosa*.

**d) Regma**: They develop from tricarpellary,
syncarpous, superior, trilocular ­ovary and splits
into one-seeded cocci which remain attached
to carpophore. Example: *Ricinus*.`


##### Aggregate Fruits


Aggregate fruits develop from a single flower
having an apocarpous pistil. each of the free
carpel develops into a simple fruitlet. A collection
of simple fruitlets makes an **Aggregate fruit**.
An individual ovary develops into a drupe,
achene, follicle or berry. An aggregate of these
fruits borne by a single flower is known as an
**etaerio**. Example: *Annona, Polyalthia*.





![reproductive-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/reproductive/Fig4.32.eng.png )


##### Multiple or Composite Fruit

A Multiple or composite fruit develops from
the whole inflorescence along with its peduncle
on which they are borne.


**a) Sorosis**: A fleshy multiple fruit which
develops from a spike or spadix. The flowers
fused together by their succulent perianth and
at the same time the axis bearing them become
fleshy or juicy and the whole inflorescence
forms a compact mass. Example: Pine apple,
Jack fruit

the world's largest fruit.
The size of mature fruit
is 40–50 cm in diameter
and weights 15–30 kg.

• Progesterone which supports pregnancy is

##### 4.7.3 Functions of Fruit

1. Edible part of the fruit is a source of food
and gives energy for animals.

2. They are source of many chemicals like
sugar, pectin, organic acids, vitamins
and minerals.

3. The fruit protects the seeds from
unfavourable climatic conditions and
animals.

4. Both fleshy and dry fruits help in the
dispersal of seeds to distant places.


5. In certain cases, fruit may provide
nutrition to the developing seedling.


6. Fruits provide source of medicine to
human.

Herod's palace near dead sea has viable
seed for 20,000 years.

• Powdered seeds of Moringa oleifera is

##### 4.8 Seed

Do all fruits contain seeds? No, triploid fruits
do not. The seed is a fertilized mature ovule
which possess an embryonic plant, usually
stores food material and has a protective coat.
After fertilization, changes occur in various
parts of the ovule and transforms into a seed

##### 4.8.1 Types of Seed

**I**. Based on the number of cotyledons
two types of seeds are recognized.

**i. Dicotyledonous seed**: Seed with two
cotyledons.

**ii. Monocotyledonous seed**: Seed with
one cotyledon.

**II**. Based on the presence or absence of the
endosperm the seed is of two types.


**i. Albuminous or Endospermous seed**:
The cotyledons are thin, membranous and
mature seeds have endosperm persistent
and nourishes the seedling during its early
development. Example: Castor, sunflower,
maize.


**ii. Ex-albuminous or non-**
**endospermous seed**: Food is utilized by
the developing embryo and so the mature
seeds are without endosperm. In such seeds,
colyledons store food and become thick and
fleshy. Example: Pea, groundnut.


##### 4.8.2 Significance of Seeds:

 The seed encloses and protects the embryo
for next generation.

 It contains food for the development of
embryo.

 It is a means for the dispersal of new
individuals of the species.

 A seed is a means for perpetuation of
the species. It may lie dormant during
unfavorable conditions but germinates on
getting suitable conditions.

 Seeds of various plants are used as food,
both for animals and men.

 They are the basis of agriculture.

 Seeds are the products of sexual
reproduction so they provide genetic
variation and recombination in a plant.

##### Summary

Inflorescence is a group of flowers present on a
common stalk. Inflorescence may be classified
into 3 types based on position. Inflorescence
classified into racemose, cymose, mixed and
special type based on the flower arrangement
and branching of axis. Flower is a modified shoot
and meant for sexual reproduction. Flower has
various parts to enhance reproduction. Flower
can be explained by its sex and symmetry. Calyx
is outermost whorl of flower and many types.
Corolla is second whorl of flower and used for
pollination. Corolla may be united or free and has
various forms in different flowers. Aestivation is
arrangement of sepals, petals in bud condition
and is of many types. Androecium is the male
part of flower and made up of stamens. Stamens
contain filament,anther and connective.


Gynoecium is the female part of flower. Ovary,
style and stigma are parts of pistil.According to
number of carpels it is divided into monocarpellary,
bicarpellary etc. It may be apocarpous or
syncarpous. Locule number may be one to many.

The ovary is superior or inferior or semi inferior.
Mode of distribution of placenta inside the ovary
is placentation. Construction of floral diagram and
floral formula for given flower with some examples.

Fruits are the products of pollination and
fertilization. Fruit developed from single ovary of
flower is called **simple fruit**. Simple fruits are two
types based on the fruit wall as simple fleshy and
simple dry. An intermediate between dehiscent
and indehiscent fruit is called schizocarpic fruit.
The simple fruits could be fleshy or dry which
could again be dehiscent or indehiscent. Fruits that
are developed from multicarpellary, apocarpus
pistil is called aggregate. Multiple or composite
fruit develops from the flowers of the complete
inflorescence. Seed is a ripened ovule which
contains the embryo or the miniature of plant
body. Seeds with one cotyledon are
monocotyledonous and with two
cotyledons are dicotyledonous.
