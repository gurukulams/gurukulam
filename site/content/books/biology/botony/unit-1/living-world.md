**Chapter Outline**

1.1 Attributes of Living organisms
1.2 Viruses
1.3 Classification of Living world
1.4 Bacteria
1.5 Fungi

Earth was formed some 4.6 billion years ago.
It is the life supporting planet with land forms
like mountains, plateaus, glaciers, etc. Life on
earth exists within a complex structure called
biosphere. There exist many mysteries and
wonders in the living world some are not visible but the activity of
some capture the attentionof all. For example the response of sun­
flower to the sunlight, the twinkling
firefly in the dark forest, the rolling water droplets on the surface of lotus
leaf, the closure of the leaf of venus fly trap
on insect touch and a squid squeezing ink to
escape from its predator. From this it is clear
that the wonder planet earth harbours both
landforms and life forms. Have you thought
of DNA molecule? It is essential for the
regulation of life and is made up of carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus.
thus nonliving and living things exist together
to make our planet unique.

 According to a survey made by
Mora et al., 2011 the number of estimated
species on earth is 8.7 million. The living
world includes microbes, plants, animals
and human beings which possess unique
and distinct characteristic feature.



**1.1 Attributes of living organisms**

The attributes of living organisms are given
below and is represented in Figure 1.1. 

![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/1.1.eng.png )


**Growth**

Growth is an intrinsic property of all living
organisms through which they can increase
cells both in number and mass. Unicellular
and multicellular organisms grow by cell
division. In plants, growth is indefinite and
occurs throughout their life. In animals,
growth is definite and occurs for some
period. Growth in non-living objects is
extrinsic. Mountains, boulders and sand
mounds grow by simple aggregation of
material on the surface. Living cells grow
by the addition of new protoplasm within
the cells. Therefore, growth in living thing
is intrinsic. In unicellular organisms like
Bacteria and Amoeba growth occurs by cell
division and such cell division also leads
to the growth of their population. Hence,
growth and reproduction are mutually
inclusive events.

**Cellular structure**

All living organisms are made up of cells
which may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic.
Prokaryotes are
unicellular,
lack
membrane bound nuclei and organelles like
mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi
bodies and so on (Example: Bacteria and
Blue green algae). In Eukaryotes a definite
nucleus and membrane bound organelles
are present. Eukaryotes may be unicellular
(Amoeba) or multicellular (Oedogonium). 

**Reproduction**

Reproduction is one of the fundamental
characteristic features of living organisms.
It is the tendency of a living organism to
perpetuate its own species. There are two
types of reproduction namely asexual and
sexual (Figure 1.2). Asexual reproduction refers to the
production of the progeny possessing
features more or less similar to those of
parents. The sexual reproduction brings out
variation through recombination. Asexual
reproduction in living organisms occurs
by the production of conidia (Aspergillus,
Penicillium), budding (Hydra and Yeast),
binary fission (Bacteria and Amoeba)
fragmentation (Spirogyra), protonema
(Mosses) and regeneration (Planaria).
Exceptions are the sterile worker bees
and mules.

**Response to stimuli**

All organisms are capable of sensing their
environment and respond to various physical,
chemical and biological stimuli. Animals senseheir surroundings by sense organs. This is
called Consciousness. Plants also respond to
the stimuli. Bending of plants towards sunlight,
the closure of leaves in touch-me-not plant
to touch are some examples for response to
stimuli in plants. This type of response is called
Irritability.


**Homeostasis**

Property of self-regulation and tendency to
maintain a steady state within an external
environment which is liable to change
is called Homeostasis. It is essential for
the living organism to maintain internal
condition to survive in the environment.

**Metabolism**

The sum of all the chemical reactions taking
place in a cell of living organism is called
metabolism. It is broadly divided into
anabolism and catabolism. The difference
between anabolism and catabolism is given
in Table 1.1.
**Table 1.1: Difference between
anabolism and catabolism**


| Anabolism |  Catabolism |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Building up process  | Breaking down process |   |   |   |
| Smaller molecules
combine together
to form larger molecule | Larger molecule break into smaller units |   |   |   |

Movement, Nutrition, Respiration and
Excretion are also considered as the property
of living things. The levels of organization
in living organism begin with atoms and
end in Biosphere. Each level cannot exist
in isolation instead they form levels of
integration as given in Figure 1.3.

**Activity 1.1**

Collect Vallisneria leaves or Chara from nearby
aquarium and observe a leaf or Chara thallus
(internodal region)under the microscope. You
could see cells clearly under the microscope.
Could you notice the movement of cytoplasm?
The movement of cytoplasm is called
cytoplasmic streaming or cyclosis.

**1.2 Viruses**

Did you go through the
headlines of newspapers
in recent times? Have
you heard of the terms
EBOLA, ZIKA, AIDS,
SARS, H1N1 etc.? There
are serious entities which are considered as
“Biological Puzzle” and cause disease in man.
They are called viruses. We have learnt about
the attributes of living world in the previous
chapter. Now we shall discuss about viruses
which connect the living and nonliving world. 

![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/4.4.eng.png )


The word virus is derived from
Latin meaning ‘Poison’. Viruses are sub-
microscopic, obligate intracellular parasites.
They have nucleic acid core surrounded by
protein coat. Viruses in their native state
contain only a single type of nucleic acid
which may be either DNA or RNA. The
study of viruses is called Virology.

![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/5.5.eng.png ) 



**1.2.1 Milestones in Virology**

1796 Edward Jenner used vaccination for
small pox

1886 Adolf Mayer demonstrated the
infectious nature of Tobacco mosaic
virus using sap of mosaic leaves.

1892 Dimitry Ivanowsky proved that
viruses are smaller than bacteria.

1898 M.W. Beijierink defined the
infectious agent in tobacco leaves as
῾Contagium vivum fluidum’

1915 F.W.Twort identified Viral infection
in Bacteria.

1917 d’Herelle coined
the
term
‘Bacteriophage’.

1984 Luc Montagnier and Robert Gallo
discovered HIV (Human Immuno
Deficiency Virus).

**1.2.2 Size and Shape**

Viruses are ultramicroscopic particles. They
are smaller than bacteria and their diameter
range from 20 to 300 nm. (1nm = 10 -9 metres).
Bacteriophage measures about 10-100 nm
in size. The size of TMV is 300×20 nm.

Generally viruses are of three types
based on shape and symmetry (Figure 1.4).

i. Cuboid symmetry – Example:
Adenovirus, Herpes virus.
ii. Helical symmetry – Example: Influenza
virus, TMV.
iii. Complex or Atypical – Example:
Bacteriophage, Vaccinia virus.

**1.2.3 Characteristic Features of Viruses**

**Living Characters**

• Presence of nucleic acid and protein.
• Capable of mutation
• Ability to multiply within living cells.
• Able to infect and cause diseases in living
beings.
• Show irritability.
• Host –specific

**Non-living Characters**

 • Can be crystallized.
• Absence of metabolism.
• Inactive outside the host.
• Do not show functional autonomy.
• Energy producing enzyme system is absent.

 ![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/6.6.eng.png ) 



**1.2.4 Classification of Viruses**

Among various classifications proposed
for viruses the classification given by David
Baltimore in the year 1971 is given below. The
classification is based on mechanism of RNA
production, the nature of the genome (single
stranded –ss or double stranded - ds), RNA or
DNA, the use of reverse transcriptase (RT), ss
RNA may be (+) sense or (–) antisense. Viruses
are classified into seven classes (Table 1.2).

**Viral genome**

Each virus possesses only one type of nucleic
acid either DNA or RNA. The nucleic acid
may be in a linear or circular form. Generallynucleic acid is present as a
single unit but in wound
tumour virus and in
influenza virus it is found
in segments. The viruses
possessing DNA are called
‘Deoxyviruses’ whereas those possessing
RNA are called ‘Riboviruses’. Majority of
animal and bacterial viruses are DNA viruses
(HIV is the animal virus which possess
RNA). Plant viruses generally contain RNA
(Cauliflower Mosaic virus possess DNA). The
nucleic acids may be single stranded or double
stranded. On the basis of nature of nucleic
acid viruses are classified into four Categories.
They are Viruses with ssDNA (Parvo viruses),
dsDNA (Bacteriophages), ssRNA (TMV)and
dsRNA(Wound Tumour Virus).

#### 1.2.5 Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV)
Tobacco mosaic virus was discovered in 1892
by Dimitry Ivanowsky from the Tobacco
plant. Viruses infect healthy plants through
vectors like aphids, locusts etc. The first
visible symptom of TMV is discoloration of
leaf colour along the veins and show typical
yellow and green mottling which is the
mosaic symptom. The downward curling
and distortion of young apical leaves occurs,
plant becomes stunted and yield is affected.

Structure
Electron microscopic studies have revealed
that TMV is a rod shaped (Figure 1.4b). helical virus measuring about 300x20nm
with a molecular weight of 39x10 6 Daltons.
The virion is made up of two constituents, a
protein coat called capsid and a core called
nucleic acid. The protein coat is made up
of approximately 2130 identical protein
subunits called capsomeres which are
present around a central single stranded
RNA molecule. The genetic information
necessary for the formation of a complete
TMV particle is contained in its RNA. The
RNA consists of 6,500 nucleotides.

#### 1.2.6 Bacteriophage
Viruses infecting bacteria are called
Bacteriophages. It literally means ‘eaters
of bacteria’ (Gr: Phagein = to eat). Phages
are abundant in soil, sewage water, fruits,
vegetables, and milk.

Structure of T 4 bacteriophage

The T 4 phage is tadpole shaped and consists
of head, collar, tail, base plate and fibres
(Figure 1.4). The head is hexagonal which
consists of about 2000 identical protein
subunits. The long helical tail consists of
an inner tubular core which is connected
to the head by a collar. There is a base plate
attached to the end of tail. The base plate
contains six spikes and tail fibres. These
fibres are used to attach the phage on the
cell wall of bacterial host during replication.
A dsDNA molecule of about 50 µm is tightly
packed inside the head. The DNA is about
1000 times longer than the phage itself.

### 1.2.7 Multiplication or Life Cycle ofPhages

Phages multiply through two different types
of life cycle. 

a. Lytic or Virulent cycle 

b.Lysogenic or Avirulent life cycle.

a. Lytic Cycle
During lytic cycle of phage, disintegration
of host bacterial cell occurs and the progeny
virions are released (Figure 1.5a). The steps
involved in the lytic cycle are as follows:
(i) Adsorption
Phage (T 4 ) particles interact with cell wall of
host (E. coli). The phage tail makes contact
between the two, and tail fibres recognize the
specific receptor sites present on bacterial cell
surface. The lipopolysaccharides of tail fibres
act as receptor in phages. The process involving
the recognition of phage to bacterium is called
landing. Once the contact is established
between tail fibres and bacterial cell, tail fibres
bend to anchor the pins and base plate to the
cell surface. This step is called pinning.

(ii) Penetration
The penetration process involves mechani-
cal and enzymatic digestion of the cell wall
of the host. At the recognition site phage
digests certain cell wall structure by viral
enzyme (lysozyme). After pinning the tail
sheath contracts (using ATP) and appears
shorter and thicker. After contraction of the
base plate enlarges through which DNA is
injected into the cell wall without using met-
abolic energy. The step involving i ­ njection of
DNA particle alone into the bacterial cell is
called Transfection. The empty protein coat
leaving outside the cell is known as ‘ghost’.
(iii) Synthesis
This step involves the degradation of
bacterial chromosome, protein synthesis
and DNA replication. The phage nucleic
acid takes over the host biosynthetic
machinery. Host DNA gets inactivated and
breaks down. Phage DNA suppresses the
synthesis of bacterial protein and directs
the metabolism of the cell to synthesis
the proteins of the phage particles and
simultaneously replication of Phage DNA
also takes place.
(iv) Assembly and Maturation
The DNA of the phage and protein coat are
synthesized separately and are assembled
to form phage particles. The process of
assembling the phage particles is known as
maturation. After 20 minutes of infection,
about 300 new phages are assembled.
(v) Release
The phage particle gets accumulated inside
the host cell and are released by the lysis of
host cell wall.


![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/8.8.eng.png )

b. Lysogenic Cycle
In the lysogenic cycle the phage DNA gets
integrated into host DNA and gets multiplied
along with nucleic acid of the host. No independent
viral particle is formed (Figure 1.5b).
As soon as the phage injects its linear
DNA into the host cell, it becomes circular
and integrates into the bacterial chromosome
by recombination. The integrated phage DNA
is now called prophage. The activity of the
prophage gene is repressed by two repressor
proteins which are synthesized by phage genes.
This checks the synthesis of new phages within
the host cell. However, each time the bacterial cell divides, the prophage multiplies along with
the bacterial chromosome. On exposure to UV
radiation and chemicals the excision of phage
DNA may occur and results in lytic cycle.

{{< box title="Do You Know?" type="objective" >}}
Viruses infecting blue green algae are called Cyanophages and are first reported by Safferman
and Morris in the year 1963(Example LPP1- Lyngbya, Plectonema and Phormidium).

Similarly, Hollings(1962) reported viruses infecting cultivated Mushrooms and causing
die back disease. The viruses attacking fungi are called **Mycoviruses** or **Mycophages**.
{{< /box >}}

**Virion** is an intact infective virus particle
which is non-replicating outside a host cell.

**Viroid** is a circular molecule of ssRNA
without a capsid and was discovered by
T.O.Diener in the year 1971. The RNA of viroid
has low molecular weight. Viroids cause citrus
exocortis and potato spindle tuber disease in
plants.

**Virusoids** were discovered by J.W.Randles
and Co-workers in 1981.They are the small
circular RNAs which are similar to viroids but
they are always linked with larger molecules of
the viral RNA.

**Prions** were discovered by Stanley
B. Prusiner in the year 1982 and are protein-
aceous infectious particles. They are the caus-
ative agents for about a dozen ­fatal ­degenerative
disorders of the central ­nervous system of
humans and other a ­ nimals. For example
Creutzfeldt – Jakob Disease (CJD), Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) – com-
monly known as mad cow disease and scrapie
disease of sheep.

### 1.2.8 Viral diseases

Viruses are known to cause disease in plants,animals and Human beings (Figure 1.6). A list of viral disease is given in Table 1.3.

Potyviridae group.
Viruses of Baculoviridae group
are commercially exploited as insecticides.

## 1.3 Classification of Living World


From the previous chapter we know that the
planet earth is endowed with living and non
-living things. In our daily life we see several
things in and around us. Imagine, you are
on a trip to Hill station. You are enjoying the
beauty of mountains, dazzling colour of the
flowers, and melodious sound of the birds. You
may be capturing most of the things you come
across in the form of photography. Now, from
this experience can you mention the objects
you have come across? Can you record your
observations and tabulate them?. How will you
organize the things? Will you place mountain
and flowers together or tall trees and trailing
herbs in one category or place it in different
category? If you place it in different category,
what made you to place them in different
category? So classification is essential and could
be done only by understanding and comparing
the things based on some characters. In this
chapter we shall learn about classification of
living world.

Many attempts have made in the past to
classify the organisms on earth. **Theophrastus**,
“Father of Botany” used the morphological
characters to classify plants into trees, shrubs
and herbs. Aristotle classified animals into
two groups. i.e., *Enaima* (with red blood) and
*Anaima* (without red blood).

Carl Linnaeus classified living world into two groups namely Plants and Animals based on morphological characters. His classification faced major setback because Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes were grouped together. Similarly
fungi, heterotrophic organisms were placed
along with the photosynthetic plants. In course
of time, the development of tools compelled
taxonomists to look for different areas like
cytology, anatomy, embryology, molecular
biology, phylogeny etc., for classifying
organisms on earth. Thus, new dimensions to
classifications were put forth from time to time.

#### 1.3.1 Need of Classification
Classification is essential to achieve
following needs.
• To relate things based on common
characteristic features.
• To define organisms based on the salient
features.
• Helps in knowing the relationship
amongst different groups of organisms.
• It helps in understanding the evolutionary
relationship between organisms.

#### 1.3.2 Classification of Living World
A comparison of classification proposed
for classification of living world is given in
Table 1.4.

#### 1.3.3 Five Kingdom Classification
R.H.Whittaker, an American taxonomist
proposed five Kingdom classification in the
year 1969. The Kingdoms include Monera,Protista, Fungi, Plantae and Animalia.(Figure 1.7).

![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/Tab1.4.eng.png )

![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/Tab1.5.eng.png )

The criteria adopted for the classification include cell structure, thallus organization, mode of nutrition, reproduction and phylogenetic relationship. A comparative account of the salient features of each Kingdom is given in Table 1.5.

![Living World](/books/biology/unit-1/the-living-world/Fig1.7.eng.png )
