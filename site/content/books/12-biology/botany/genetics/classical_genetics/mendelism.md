The contribution of Mendel to Genetics is called
Mendelism. It includes all concepts brought out
by Mendel through his original research on
plant hybridization. Mendelian genetic concepts
are basic to modern genetics. Therefore, Mendel
is called as **Father of Genetics**


#### Father of Genetics – Gregor Johann Mendel (1822 – 1884)

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.1.png )


The first Geneticist,Gregor Johann Mendel unraveled the mystery of heredity. He was born on 22<sup>nd</sup> July 1822 in Heinzendorf Silesia (now Hyncice,Czechoslovakia) Austria. After school education, later he studied botany, physics and
mathematics at the University of Vienna.He
then entered a monastery of St.Thomas at Brunn
in Austria and continued his interest in plant
hybridization.In 1849 Mendel got a temporary
position in a school as a teacher and he performed
a series of elegant experiments with pea plants
in his garden. In 1856, he started his historic
studies on pea plants. 1856 to 1863 was the
period of Mendel’s hybridization experiments
on pea plants. Mendel discovered the principles
of heredity by studying the inheritance of seven
pairs of contrasting traits of pea plant in his
garden. Mendel crossed and catalogued 24,034
plants through many generations. His paper entitled **“Experiments on Plant Hybrids”** was
presented and published in The Proceedings of
the Brunn Society of Natural History in 1866.
Mendel was the first systematic researcher in
the field of genetics.

**Mendel was successful because:**

* He applied mathematics and statistical
methods to biology and laws of probability
to his breeding experiments.

* He followed scientific methods and kept
accurate and detailed records that include
quantitative data of the outcome of his
crosses.

* His experiments were carefully planned
and he used large samples.

* The pairs of contrasting characters which
were controlled by factor (genes)were
present on separate chromosomes. (Figure
2.4)

* The parents selected by Mendel were pure
breed lines and the purity was tested by self
crossing the progeny for many generations.

**Mendel’s Experimental System – TheGarden pea.**

He chose pea plant because,

* It is an annual plant and has clear
contrasting characters that are controlled
by a single gene separately.

* Self-fertilization occurred under normal
conditions in garden pea plants. Mendel
used both self-fertilization and cross-
fertilization.

* The flowers are large hence emasculation
and pollination are very easy for
hybridization.

#### Mendel’s experiments on pea plant

Mendel’s theory of inheritance, known as the
Particulate theory, establishes the existence of
minute particles or hereditary units or factors,
which are now called as genes. He performed
artificial pollination or cross pollination experiments with several true-breeding lines of pea plants. A true breeding lines (Pure-breeding
strains) means it has undergone continuous
self pollination having stable trait inheritance
from parent to offspring. Matings within pure
breeding lines produce offsprings having specific
parental traits that are constant in inheritance
and expression for many generations. Pure line
breed refers to homozygosity only. Fusion of
male and female gametes produced by the same
individual i.e pollen and egg are

derived from the same plant is known as self-
fertilization. Self pollination takes place in
Mendel’s peas. The experimenter can remove
the anthers (Emasculation) before fertilization
and transfer the pollen from another variety of
pea to the stigma of flowers where the anthers
are removed. This results in cross-fertilization,
which leads to the creation of hybrid varieties
with different traits. Mendel’s work on the
study of the pattern of inheritance and the
principles or laws formulated, now constitute
the Mendelian Genetics.

**Figure 2.4: Mendel’s seven characters in Garden Peas, shown on the plant’s seven chromosomes**



  Mendel worked at the rules of inheritance
and arrived at the correct mechanism before any
knowledge of cellular mechanism, DNA, genes,
chromosomes became available. Mendel insights
and meticulous work into the mechanism of
inheritance played an important role which led
to the development of improved crop varieties
and a revolution in crop hybridization.

Mendel died in 1884. In 1900 the work of
Mendel’s experiments were rediscovered by three biologists, **Hugo de Vries** of Holland, **CarlCorrens** of Germany and **Erich von Tschermak**
of Austria.

Can you identify Mendel’s gene for
**regulating white colour** in peas? 

Let us find the **molecular answer** to understand the
gene function. Now the genetic mystery of
**Mendel’s white flowers is solved.**
It is quite fascinating to trace the Mendel’s
genes. In 2010, the gene responsible for regulating flower colour in peas were identified by an Figure 2.5: Purple flower international team of Pea with Pea Gene A
of researchers. and White flower of Pea
It was called **Pea Gene A** which encodes a **protein**
that functions as a transcription factor
which is responsible for the production of
**anthocyanin pigment**. So the flowers are
purple. Pea plants with white flowers do not
have anthocyanin, even though they have
the gene that encodes the enzyme involved
in anthocyanin synthesis.
Researchers delivered normal copies of
gene A into the cells of the petals of white
flowers by the gene gun method. When
Gene A entered in a small percentage of
cells of white flowers it is expressed in those
particular cells, accumulated anthocyanin
pigments and became purple.

In white flowers the gene A sequence showed
a single-nucleotide change that makes
the transcription factor inactive. So the
mutant form of gene A do not accumulate
anthocyanin and hence they are white.

#### Terminology related to Mendelism

Mendel noticed two different expressions of
a trait – Example: Tall and dwarf. Traits are
expressed in different ways due to the fact that a
gene can exist in alternate forms (versions) for
the same trait is called **alleles***. If an individual has two identical alleles of
a gene, it is called as **homozygous(TT)**. An
individual with two different alleles is called
**heterozygous(Tt)**. Mendels non-true breeding
plants are heterozygous, called as **hybrids**.
When the gene has two alleles the dominant
allele is symbolized with capital letter and the
recessive with small letter. When both alleles are
recessive the individual is called **homozygous recessive (tt)** dwarf pea plants. An individual with two dominant alleles is called homozygous
**dominant (TT)** tall pea plants. One dominant
allele and one recessive allele (Tt) denotes non-
true breeding tall pea plants **heterozygous tall.**

#### <u> Mendelian inheritance – Mendel’s Laws of Heredity 

Mendel proposed two rules based on his
observations on monohybrid cross, today these
rules are called laws of inheritance The first law
is The Law of Dominance and the second law
is The Law of Segregation. These scientific laws
play an important role in the history of evolution.

**The Law of Dominance:** The characters are
controlled by discrete units called factors which
occur in pairs. In a dissimilar pair of factors one
member of the pair is dominant and the other
is recessive. This law gives an explanation to the
monohybrid cross (a) the expression of only one
of the parental characters in F<sub>1</sub> generation and (b)
the expression of both in the F<sub>2</sub> generation. It also
explains the proportion of 3:1 obtained at the F<sub>1</sub>

**The Law of Segregation (Law of Purity of gametes):**
Alleles do not show any blending,
both characters are seen as such in the F<sub>2</sub>
generation although one of the characters is not
seen in the F<sub>1</sub> generation. During the formation
of gametes, the factors or alleles of a pair separate
and segregate from each other such that each
gamete receives only one of the two factors. A
homozygous parent produces similar gametes
and a heterozygous parent produces two kinds
of gametes each having one allele with equal
proportion. **Gametes are never hybrid**.
