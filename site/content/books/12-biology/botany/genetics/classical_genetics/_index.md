Genetics is the study of how living
things receive common traits from previous
generations. No field of science has changed the
world more, in the past 50 years than genetics.
The scientific and technological advances in
genetics have transformed agriculture, medicine
and forensic science etc.

Genetics – The Science of heredity (Inheritance)
-“Genetics” is the branch of biological science
which deals with the mechanism of transmission
of characters from parents to offsprings. The term
**Genetics** was introduced by **W. Bateson in 1906.**
The four major subdisciplines of genetics are

**1.Transmission Genetics / Classical Genetics** - Deals with the transmission of genes
from parents to offsprings. The foundation
of classical genetics came from the study
of hereditary behaviour of seven genes by
Gregor Mendel.

**2.Molecular Genetics** - Deals with the structure and function of a gene at molecular
level.

**3.Population Genetics** - Deals with heredity
in groups of individuals for traits which is
determined by a few genes.

**4.Quantitative Genetics** - Deals with heredity
of traits in groups of individuals where
the traits are governed by many genes
simultaneously.

**What is the reason for similarities, differences of appearance and skipping of generations?**

Genes – Functional Units of inheritance:
The basic unit of heredity (biological
information) which transmits biochemical,
anatomical and behavioural traits from
parents to offsprings.
