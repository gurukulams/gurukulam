Genetics is often described as a science which
deals with heredity and variation.

**Heredity:** Heredity is the transmission of
characters from parents to offsprings.

**Variation:** The organisms belonging to the
same natural population or species that
shows a difference in the characteristics is
called variation. Variation is of two types (i)
Discontinuous variation and (ii) Continuous
variation.

**1. Discontinuous Variation:**

Within a population there are some
characteristics which show a limited form of
variation. Example: Style length in Primula,
plant height of garden pea. In discontinuous
variation, the characteristics are controlled by
genes which may have one or two major two or more allelic forms. These variations are
genetically determined by inheritance factors.
Individuals produced by this variation show
differences without any intermediate form
between them and there is no overlapping
between the two phenotypes. The phenotypic
expression is unaffected by environmental
conditions. This is also called as qualitative
inheritance.

**2.Continuous Variation:**

This variation may be due to the combining
effects of environmental and genetic factors.
In a population most of the characteristics
exhibit a complete gradation, from one extreme
to the other without any break. Inheritance
of phenotype is determined by the combined
effects of many genes, (polygenes) and
environmental factors. This is also known as
quantitative inheritance. Example: Human
height and skin color.

**Importance of variations**

* Variations make some individuals better
fitted in the struggle for existence.

* They help the individuals to adapt
themselves to the changing environment.

* It provides the genetic material for natural
selection

* Variations allow breeders to improve better
yield, quicker growth, increased resistance
and lesser input.

* They constitute the raw materials for
evolution.
