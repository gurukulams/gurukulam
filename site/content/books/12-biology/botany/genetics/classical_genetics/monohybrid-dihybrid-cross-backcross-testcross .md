Monohybrid inheritance is the inheritance of a
single character i.e. plant height.It involves the
inheritance of two alleles of a single gene. When
the F<sub>1</sub> generation was selfed Mendel noticed that
787 of 1064 F<sub>2</sub> plants were tall, while 277 of 1064
were dwarf. The dwarf trait disappeared in the F<sub>1</sub>
generation only to reappear in the F<sub>2</sub> generation.
The term **genotype** is the genetic constitution
of an individual. The term **phenotype** refers to
the observable characteristic of an organism. In
a genetic cross the genotypes and **phenotypes**
of offspring, resulting from combining gametes
during fertilization can be easily understood with
the help of a diagram called Punnett’s Square named
after a British Geneticist Reginald C.Punnett.
It is a graphical representation to calculate the


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.5.png )



probability of all possible genotypes of offsprings
in a genetic cross.The Law of Dominance and the
Law of Segregation give suitable explanation to
Mendel’s monohybrid cross. 

**Reciprocal cross** – In one experiment, the
tall pea plants were pollinated with the pollens
from a true-breeding dwarf plants, the result
was all tall plants. When the parental types were
reversed, the pollen from a tall plant was used to
pollinate a dwarf pea plant which gave only tall
plants. The result was the same - All tall plants.
Tall ( ) x Dwarf ( ) and Tall ( ) x Dwarf ( )
matings are done in both ways which are called
reciprocal crosses.The results of the reciprocal
crosses are the same. So it was concluded that the
trait is not sex dependent. The results of Mendel’s
monohybrid crosses were not sex dependent.

The gene for plant height has two alleles: Tall
(T) x Dwarf (t). The phenotypic and genotypic
analysis of the crosses has been shown by
Checker board method or by Forkline method.



#### Mendel’s analytical and empirical approach

Mendel chose two contrasting traits for each
character. So it seemed logical that two distinct
factors exist. In F<sub>1</sub> the recessive trait and its
factors do not disappear and they are hidden or
masked only to reappear in  ¼  of the F<sub>2</sub> generation.
He concluded that tall and dwarf alleles of F<sub>1</sub>
heterozygote segregate randomly into gametes.
Mendel got 3:1 ratio in F<sub>2</sub> between the dominant
and recessive trait. He was the first scientist to use
this type of quantitative analysis in a biological
experiment. Mendel’s data is concerned with the
proportions of offspring.

Mendel’s analytical approach is truly an
outstanding scientific achievement. His meticulous
work and precisely executed breeding experiments
proposed that discrete particulate units of heredity
are present and they are transmitted from one
generation to the other. Now they are called as
genes. Mendel’s experiments were well planned to
determine the relationships which govern hereditary
traits. This rationale is called an empirical approach.
Laws that were arrived from an empirical approach is known as empirical laws.

#### Test cross

Test cross is crossing an individual of unknown
genotype with a homozygous recessive.

In Mendel’s monohybrid cross all the plants
are tall in F<sub>1</sub> generation. In F<sub>2</sub> tall and dwarf plants
were in the ratio of 3:1.Mendel self pollinated
dwarf F<sub>2</sub> plants and got dwarf plants in F<sub>3</sub> and F<sub>4</sub>
generations. So he concluded that the genotype of
dwarf was homozygous (tt). The genotypes of tall
plants TT or Tt from F1and F<sub>2</sub> cannot be predicted.
But how we can tell if a tall plant is homozygous
or heterozygous? To determine the genotype of a
tall plant Mendel crossed the plants from F<sub>2</sub> with
the homozygous recessive dwarf plant. This he
called a test cross. The progenies of the test cross
can be easily analysed to predict the genotype of
the plant or the test organism. Thus in a typical test
cross an organism (pea plants) showing dominant
phenotype (whose genotype is to be determined)
is crossed with the recessive parent instead of self
crossing. Test cross is used to identify whether
an individual is homozygous or heterozygous for
dominant character.

#### Back cross

* Back cross is a cross of F<sub>1</sub> hybrid with any
one of the parental genotypes. The back
cross is of two types; they are dominant
back cross and recessive back cross.

* It involves the cross between the F<sub>1</sub> offspring
with either of the two parents.

* When the F<sub>1</sub> offsprings are crossed with
the dominant parents all the F<sub>2</sub> develop
dominant character and no recessive
individuals are obtained in the progeny.

* If the F<sub>1</sub> hybrid is crossed with the recessive
parent individuals of both the phenotypes
appear in equal proportion and this cross is
specified as test cross.

* The recessive back cross helps to identify
the heterozygosity of the hybrid.

#### Dihybrid cross

It is a genetic cross which involves individuals
differing in two characters. Dihybrid inheritance is the inheritance of two separate genes each with two alleles.

**Why Mendel’s pea plants are tall and dwarf?**

**Find out the molecular explanation.**

Molecular characterization of Mendel’s
gene for plant height.
The plant height is controlled by a single gene
with two alleles. The reason for this difference
in plant height is due to the following facts:
(i) the cells of the pea plant have the ability to
convert a precursor molecule of gibberellins
into an active form (GA1) (ii) Tall pea plants
have one allele (Le) that codes for a protein
(functional enzyme) which functions normally
in the gibberellin-synthesis pathway and
catalyzes the formation of gibberellins (GA1).
The allele is dominant even if it is two (Le Le)
or single (Le le), it produces gibberellins and
the pea plants are tall. Dwarf pea plants have
two recessive alleles (le le) which code for
non-functional protein, hence they are dwarf.

**Law of Independent Assortment**

– Whentwo pairs of traits are combined in a hybrid,
segregation of one pair of characters is
independent to the other pair of characters. Genes
that are located in different chromosomes assort independently during meiosis. Many possible combinations of factors can occur in the gametes.




![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.9.png )


Independent assortment leads to genetic
diversity. If an individual produces genetically
dissimilar gametes it is the consequence of
independent assortment. Through independent
assortment, the maternal and paternal members
of all pairs were distributed to gametes, so all
possible chromosomal combinations were
produced leading to genetic variation. In sexually
reproducing plants / organisms, due to independent
assortment, genetic variation takes place which is
important in the process of evolution. The Law of
Segregation is concerned with alleles of one gene
but the Law of Independent Assortment deals with
the relationship between genes.

The crossing of two plants differing in two
pairs of contrasting traits is called dihybrid
cross. In dihybrid cross, two characters (colour
and shape) are considered at a time. Mendel
considered the seed shape (round and wrinkled)
and cotyledon colour (yellow & green) as the two
characters. In seed shape round (R) is dominant
over wrinkled (r) ; in cotyledon colour yellow
(Y) is dominant over green (y). Hence the pure



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.10.png )



breeding round yellow parent is represented by
the genotype RRYY and the pure breeding green
wrinkled parent is represented by the genotype
rryy. During gamete formation the paired genes
of a character assort out independently of the
other pair. During the F<sub>1</sub> x F<sub>1</sub> fertilization each
zygote with an equal probability receives one of
the four combinations from each parent. The

**How does the wrinkled gene make Mendel’s peas wrinkled?** 

**Find out the molecular explanation.**

The protein called starch branching
enzyme (SBEI) is encoded by the wild-type
allele of the gene (RR) which is dominant.
When the seed matures, this enzyme SBEI
catalyzes the formation of highly branched
starch molecules. Normal gene (R) has
become interrupted by the insertion of extra
piece of DNA (0.8 kb) into the gene, resulting
in r allele. In the homozygous mutant form of
the gene (rr) which is recessive, the activity of
the enzyme SBEI is lost resulting in wrinkled
peas. The wrinkled seed accumulates more
sucrose and high water content. Hence the
osmotic pressure inside the seed rises. As
a result, the seed absorbs more water and
when it matures it loses water as it dries. So
it becomes wrinkled at maturation. When
the seed has atleast one copy of normal
dominant gene heterozygous, the dominant
allele helps to synthesize starch, amylopectin
an insoluble carbohydrate, with the osmotic
balance which minimises the loss of water
resulting in smooth structured round seed.

resultant gametes thus will be genetically different
and they are of the following four types:

1) Yellow round (YR)                      -  9/16

2) Yellow wrinkled (Yr)                   -   3/16

3) Green round (yR)                       -  3/16

4) Green wrinkled (yr)                    - 1/16

These four types of gametes of  F<sub>1</sub> dihybrids
unite randomly in the process of fertilization and
produce sixteen types of individuals in  F<sub>2</sub> in the
ratio of 9:3:3:1 as shown in the figure. Mendel’s
9:3:3:1 dihybrid ratio is an ideal ratio based on the
probability including segregation, independent
assortment and random fertilization. In sexually
reproducing organism / plants from the garden
peas to human beings, Mendel’s findings laid the
foundation for understanding inheritance and
revolutionized the field of biology. The dihybrid
cross and its result led Mendel to propose a second
set of generalisations that we called Mendel's Law
of independent assortment.

#### Extensions of Mendelian Genetics

Apart from monohybrid, dihybrid and
trihybrid crosses, there are exceptions to
Mendelian principles, i.e. the occurrence of
different phenotypic ratios. The more complex
patterns of inheritance are the extensions of
Mendelian Genetics. There are examples where
phenotype of the organism is the result of the
interactions among genes.

**Gene interaction** – A single phenotype is
controlled by more than one set of genes, each of
which has two or more alleles. This phenomenon
is called Gene Interaction. Many
characteristics of the organism
including structural and chemical
which constitute the phenotype are
the result of interaction between
two or more genes.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.13.png )



Mendelian experiments prove that a
single gene controls one character. But in the
post Mendelian findings, various exception
have been noticed, in which different types of interactions are possible between the genes.
This gene interaction concept was introduced
and explained by W. Bateson. This concept
is otherwise known as Factor hypothesis or
Bateson’s factor hypothesis. According to
Bateson’s factor hypothesis, the gene interactions
can be classified as

* Intragenic gene interactions or Intra allelic
or allelic interactions
Intergenic gene interactions or inter allelic

*  or non-allelic interactions
