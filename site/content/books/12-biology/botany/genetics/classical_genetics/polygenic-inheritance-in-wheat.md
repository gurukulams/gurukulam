### 2.6 Polygenic Inheritance in Wheat(Kernel colour)

Polygenic inheritance - Several genes combine
to affect a single trait.

A group of genes that together determine
(contribute) a characteristic of an organism
is called polygenic inheritance. It gives
explanations to the inheritance of continuous
traits which are compatible with Mendel’s Law.

The first experiment on polygenic
inheritance was demonstrated by Swedish
Geneticist H. Nilsson - Ehle (1909) in wheat
kernels. Kernel colour is controlled by two
genes each with two alleles, one with red kernel
colour was dominant to white. He crossed the
two pure breeding wheat varieties dark red
and a white. Dark red genotypes R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>R<sub>2</sub> and
white genotypes are r<sub>1</sub>r<sub>1</sub>r<sub>2</sub>r<sub>2</sub>. In the F<sub>1</sub>generation  medium red were obtained with the genotype
R<sub>1</sub>r<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>r<sub>2</sub>. F<sub>1</sub> wheat plant produces four types of gametes R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>1</sub>r<sub>2</sub>, r<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>, r<sub>1</sub>r<sub>2</sub>. The intensity of the red colour is determined by the number of R genes in the F<sub>2</sub> generation.

**Four R genes:** A dark red kernel colour is obtained.**Three R genes:** Medium - dark red kernel colour is obtained.**Two R genes:** Medium-
red kernel colour is obtained.**One R gene:** Light
red kernel colour is obtained. **Absence of R gene:**  Results in White kernel colour.
The R gene in an additive manner produces the
red kernel colour. The number of each phenotype
is plotted against the intensity of red kernel
colour which produces a bell shaped curve. This
represents the distribution of phenotype. Other
example: Height and skin colour in humans are
controlled by three pairs of genes.

**Conclusion:**

Finally the loci that was studied by Nilsson –
Ehle were not linked and the genes assorted
independently.Later, researchers discovered the third gene
that also affect the kernel colour of wheat. The
three independent pairs of alleles were involved
in wheat kernel colour. Nilsson – Ehle found
the ratio of 63 red : 1 white in F<sub>2</sub> generation –
1 : 6 : 15 : 20 : 15 : 6 : 1 in F<sub>2</sub> generation.

From the above results Nilsson – Ehle
showed that the blending inheritance was
not taking place in the kernel of wheat. In F<sub>2</sub>
generation plants have kernels with wide range of colour variation. This is due to the fact thatthe genes are segregating and recombination
takes place. Another evidence for the absence
of blending inheritance is that the parental
phenotypes dark red and white appear again
in F<sub>2</sub>. There is no blending of genes, only the
phenotype. The cumulative effect of several pairs
of gene interaction gives rise to many shades of
kernel colour. He hypothesized that the two loci
must contribute additively to the kernel colour
of wheat. The contribution of each red allele to
the kernel colour of wheat is additive.
