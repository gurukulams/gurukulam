DNA is the universal genetic material. Genes
located in nuclear chromosomes follow
Mendelian inheritance. But certain traits
are governed either by the chloroplast or
mitochondrial genes. This phenomenon is
known as extra nuclear inheritance. It is a kind
of Non-Mendelian inheritance. Since it involves
cytoplasmic organelles such as chloroplast and
mitochondrion that act as inheritance vectors,
it is also called Cytoplasmic inheritance. It is
based on independent, self-replicating extra
chromosomal unit called plasmogene located
in the cytoplasmic organelles, chloroplast and
mitochondrion.

**Chloroplast Inheritance**

It is found in 4 O’ Clock plant (Mirabilis jalapa).
In this, there are two types of variegated leaves
namely dark green leaved plants and pale green
leaved plants. When the pollen of dark green
leaved plant (male) is transferred to the stigma of
pale green leaved plant (female) and pollen of pale
green leaved plant is transferred to the stigma of
dark green leaved plant, the F<sub>1</sub> generation of both
the crosses must be identical as per Mendelian
inheritance. But in the reciprocal cross the F<sub>1</sub> plant
differs from each other. In each cross, the F<sub>1</sub> plant
reveals the character of the plant which is used as female plant.

This inheritance is not through nuclear
gene. It is due to the chloroplast gene found in
the ovum of the female plant which contributes
the cytoplasm during fertilization since the
male gamete contribute only the nucleus but
not cytoplasm.

Recently it has been discovered that
cytoplasmic genetic male sterility is common in
many plant species. This sterility is maintained
by the influence of both nuclear and cytoplasmic
genes. There are commonly two types of
cytoplasm N (normal) and S (sterile). The genes for these are found in mitochondrion. There are  also restores of fertility (Rf) genes. Even though
these genes are nuclear genes, they are distinct
from genetic male sterility genes of other plants.
Because the Rf genes do not have any expression
of their own, unless the sterile cytoplasm is
present. Rf genes are required to restore fertility
in S cytoplasm which is responsible for sterility.


So the combination of N cytoplasm with rfrf
and S cytoplasm with RfRf produces plants
with fertile pollens, while S cytoplasm with rfrf
produces only male sterile plants.

**Atavism**

Atavism is a modification of a biological
structure whereby an ancestral trait reappears
after having been lost through reemergence
of sexual reproduction in the flowering plant
Hieracium pilosella is the best example for
Atavism in plants.

**Summary**

Gregor Johann Mendel, father of Genetics
unraveled the mystery of heredity through his
experiments on garden peas. Mendel’s laws,
analytical and empirical reasoning endure till
now guiding geneticists to study variation. The
monohybrid cross of Mendel proved his particulate
theory of inheritance. In F<sub>2</sub> the alternative traits
were expressed in the ratio of 3 dominant and 1
recessive. The characteristic 3 : 1 segregation is
referred to as Mendelian ratio. Parents transmit
discrete information about the traits to their
offspring which Mendel called it as “factors”. To
test his experimental results Mendel devised a
powerful procedure called the test cross. Test cross
is used to determine the genotype of an individual
when two genes are involved. In Mendel’s dihyrbid
cross, the two pairs of factors were inherited
independently. From the results of dihybrid cross
Mendel gave the Law of Independent Assortment.
Mendel’s dihybrid ratio of 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 with the
representation of two new recombinations
appeared in the progeny, i.e. round green peas
or wrinkled yellow peas. Molecular explanation of Mendel’s gene for monohybrid cross, dihybrid cross were explained. Extension of Mendelian
Genetics was dealt with examples for interaction
among genes. Incomplete dominance is not an
example for blending inheritance. Incomplete
dominance exhibits a phenotypic heterozygote
intermediate between the two homozygous. In
plants codominance can be demonstrated by the
methods of electrophoresis or chromatography
for protein or flavonoid substances. Lethal genes
with an example are explained. Pleiotropy a single
gene which affects multiple traits was explained
with an example of Pisum sativum. Dominant
epistatis in summer squash with 12 : 3 : 1 ratio was
discussed. Polygenic inheritance is an example
for inheritance of continuous traits which is
compatible with Mendel’s laws. The inheritance
of mitochondrial and chloroplast genes were
explained with examples which does not follow
the rules of nuclear genes.
