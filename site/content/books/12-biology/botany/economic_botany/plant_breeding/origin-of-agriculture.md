Archeological evidence for earliest record
of agriculture is found in the fertile crescent
region in and around Tigris and Euphrates river
valleys, approximately about 12,000 years ago.
The earlier Greek and Roman naturalists
like Theophrastus, Dioscorides, Pliny the elder
and Galen laid down the scientific foundation
in understanding origin and domestication of
cultivated plants.
