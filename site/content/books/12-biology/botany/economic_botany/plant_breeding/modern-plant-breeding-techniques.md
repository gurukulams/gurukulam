In the milestones of plant breeding methods
Genetic Engineering, Plant tissue culture,
Protoplasmic fusion or somatic hybridisation,
Molecular marking and DNA finger printing are
some of the modern plant breeding tools used
to improve the crop varieties. We have already
discussed about the various techniques and
application of the above mentioned concepts in
Unit VIII.


**New Plant Engineering Techniques / New Breeding Techniques (NBT)**

NBT are a collection of methods that could
increase and accelerate the development of new
traits in plant breeding. These techniques often
involve genome editing, to modify DNA at
specific locations within the plants to produce
new traits in crop plants. The various methods
of achieving these changes in traits include the
following.

* Cutting and modifying the genome
during the repair process by tools like CRISPR
/Cas.


*  Genome editing to introduce changes in
few base pairs using a technique called
Oligonucleotide-directed
mutagenesis
(ODM).

*  Transferring a gene from an identical or
closely related species (cisgenesis)


* Organising processes that alter gene
activity without altering the DNA itself
(epigenetic methods).


### Summary

Economic Botany deals with the
relationship between people and economically
important plants to fulfill the three basic
needs of life such as food, clothing and
shelter. Domestication, a term often used for
a more intricate process, involves the genetic
alteration of plants which did not appear at
once, but rather over a substantial period of
time, perhaps hundreds of years for some
species. In the history of agriculture Vavilov
has given the eight main centres of origin of
plants were now divided into 12 centres of
origin. In Organic agriculture biofertilizers
are microbial inoculants which all ecofriendly,
more effective even though cost effective than
chemical fertilizers. *Rhizobium, Azolla,* VAM
and sea weeds are used as fertilizers which
increase the crop yield many fold.



Plant breeding is a purposeful manipulation
of plant species in order to create desirable
genotype and phenotype for the benefit of
mankind. Plant introduction, selection,
hybridization, heterosis, mutation breeding,
polyploidy breeding and green revolution are
the different methods of conventional breeding.
