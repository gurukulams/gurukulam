From the very early times, human beings have
co-existed with plants which played a vital
role in their survival. Through a long process
of trial and error, our ancestors have selected
hundreds of wild plants from the various
parts of the world for their specific use. The
knowledge of the plants and its applications
have led to the development of the humans and
their civilization in many ways.
