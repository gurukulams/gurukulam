**Acclimatization :** The adaptation of an individual
to a changed climate or the adjustment of a
species or a population to a changed environment
over a number of generations.

**Agronomy :** Science of farming

**Germplasm Collection :**  The entire collection
(of plants / seeds) having all the diverse
alleles for all genes in a given crop is called
**germplasm collection.**

**Non recurrent parent :** The parent of a hybrid
that is not again used as a parent in backcrossing

**Quarantine :** Strict isolation imposed to prevent
the spread of disease

**Strain :** A group of similar individuals from a
common origin.

**Biofortification –** breeding crops with higher levels of vitamins and minerals or higher protein
and healthier fats – is the most practical means to improve public health.
Breeding for improved nutritional quality is undertaken with the objectives of improving

•Protein content and quality

•Oil content and quality

•Vitamin content and

•Micronutrient and mineral content


In 2000, maize hybrids that had twice the amount of amino acids, lysine and tryptophan, compared
to existing maize hybrids were developed. Wheat variety, Atlas 66 having a high protein content,
has been used a donor for improving cultivated wheat. It has been possible to develop an iron
fortified rice variety containing over five times as much iron as in commonly consumed varieties.
The Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi has also released several vegetable crops
that are rich in vitamins and minerals, example: vitamin A enriched carrots, spinach, pumpkin;
vitamin C enriched bitter gourd, bathua, mustard, tomato; iron and calcium enriched spinach and
protein enriched beans – broad, lablab, French garden peas.


**Sugar cane:** Saccharum bareri was originally grown in North India, but had poor sugar content and
yield. Tropical canes grown in South India Saccharum officinarum had thicker stems and higher sugar
content but did not grow well in North India. These two species were successfully crossed to get sugar
cane varieties combining the desirable qualities of high yield, thick stems, high sugar and ability to grow
in the sugarcane areas of North India.
