#### 9.5 Plant Breeding

Plant breeding is the science of improvement
of crop varieties with higher yield, better
quality, resistance to diseases and shorter
durations which are suitable to particular
environment. In other words, it is a purposeful
manipulation of plant species in order to
create desired genotype and phenotype for
the benefit of humans. In early days, plant
breeding activities were based mainly on
skills and ability of person involved. But as
the principles of genetics and cytogenetics
have elucidated breeding methods such as
selection, introduction, hybridization, ploidy,
mutation, tissue culture and biotechnology
techniques were designed to develop improved
crop varieties.


#### 9.5.1. Objectives of Plant Breeding

*  To increase yield, vigour and fertility of the crop.

* To increase tolerance to environmental
condition, salinity, temperature
and drought.

* To prevent the premature falling of buds,
fruits etc.

To improve synchronous maturity.

* To develop resistance to
pathogens and pests.

* To develop
photosensitive and
thermos-sensitive
varieties.
