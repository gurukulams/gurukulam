###  9.2 Domestication of plants 

Domestication is the process of bringing a
plant species under the control of humans and
gradually changing it through careful selection,
genetic alteration and handling so that it is more
useful to people. The domesticated species are
renewable sources that have provided food and
other benefits to human.
The possible changes in the plant species due
to domestication are listed below;

•	Adaptation to a greater diversity of
environments and a wider
geographical range.

•	Simultaneous /uniform flowering
and fruiting.

• Lack of shattering or scattering of seeds.

• Increased size of fruits and seeds.

• Change from a perennial to annual habit.

• Change in breeding system.

• Increased yield.

• Increased resistance for disease and pest.

• Developing seedless parthenocarpic
fruit.

• Enhancing colour, appearance,
palatability and nutritional composition.
