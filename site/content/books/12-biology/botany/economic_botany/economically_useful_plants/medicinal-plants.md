India is a treasure house of medicinal plants.
They are linked to local heritage as well as to
global-trade. All institutional systems in India
primarily use medicinal plants as drug sources.
At present, 90% collection of medicinal plants
is from the non-cultivated sources. Growing
demand for herbal products has led to quantum
jump in volume of plant materials traded
within and across the countries. Increasing
demand exerts a heavy strain on the existing
resources. Now efforts are being made to
introduce cultivation techniques of medicinal
plants to the farmers.

Medicinal plants play a significant role in
providing primary health care services to rural
and tribal people. They serve as therapeutic
agents as well as important raw materials for
the manufacture of traditional and modern
medicines. Medicinally useful molecules
obtained from plants that are marketed as drugs
are called Biomedicines. Medicinal plants which
are marketed as powders or in other modified
forms are known as Botanical medicines.

**Psychoactive Drugs**

In the above chapter you have learnt about
plants that are used medicinally to treat
various diseases. Phytochemicals / drugs
from some of the plants alter an individual’s
perceptions of mind by producing
hallucination are known as psychoactive
drugs. These drugs are used in all ancient
culture especially by Shamans and by
traditional healers. Here we focus on two
such plants namely Poppy and Marijuana.

**Opium poppy**

Botanical name : *Papaver somniferum*
Family: Papaveraceae

Opium poppy is native to South Eastern
Europe and Western Asia. Madhya Pradesh,

Opium is derived from the exudates of
fruits of poppy plants. It was traditionally
used to induce sleep and for relieving pain.
Opium yields **Morphine,** a strong analgesic
which is used in surgery. However, opium is
an addiction forming drug.

**Cannabis / Marijuana**

*Botanical name : Cannabis sativa*
**Family: Cannabiaceae**

**Origin and Area of Cultivation:** Marijuana
is native to China. States such as Gujarat,
Himachal Pradesh, Uttarkand, Uttarpradesh
and Madhaya Pradesh have legally permitted
to cultivate industrial hemp/Marijuana
The active principle in Marijuana
is **trans-tetrahydrocanabinal** (THC). It
possess a number of medicinal properties.
It is an effective pain reliever and reduces
hypertension.

THC is used in treating
**Glaucoma** a condition in which pressure
develops in the eyes. THC is also used in
reducing nausea of cancer patients undergoing
radiation and chemotherapy. THC provides
relief to bronchial disorders, especially asthma
as it dilates bronchial vessels. Because of these
medicinal properties, cultivation of cannabis
is legalized in some countries. However,
prolonged use causes addiction and has an
effect on individual’s health and society.

Hence most of the countries have banned its
cultivation and use.
