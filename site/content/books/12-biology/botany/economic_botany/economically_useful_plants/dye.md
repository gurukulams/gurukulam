### 10.7 Dyes

The ability to perceive colour is a wonderful
aspect of human eyes and dyes add colour to
the goods we use. They have been in use since
the ancient times.

The earliest authentic records of dyeing
were found in the tomb painting of ancient
Egypt. Colourings on mummy cements
(wrapping) included saffron and indigo. They
can also be seen in rock paintings in India.
