### 10.11 Entrepreneurial Botany

**Entrepreneurial Botany** is the study of
how new businesses are created using plant
resources as well as the actual process of
starting a new business. An **entrepreneur** is
someone who has an idea and who works to
create a product or service that people will
buy, by building an organization to support the
sales. **Entrepreneurship** is now a popular topic
for higher secondary students, with a focus on
developing ideas to create new ventures among
the young people.

Vast opportunities are there for the students of
Botany. In the present scenario students should
acquire ability to merge skills and knowledge
in a meaningful way. Converting botanical
knowledge into a business idea that can be
put into practice for earning a livelihood is the
much-needed training for the students.

Few
examples
for
activities
of
entrepreneurship are Mushroom cultivation,
Single cell protein (SCP) production, Seaweed
liquid fertilizer, Organic farming, Terrarium,
Bonsai and Cultivation of medicinal and
aromatic plants.

This part of the chapter is dealt about organic
farming in brief.

#### 10.11.1 Organic farming

Organic farming is an alternative agricultural
system in which plants/crops are cultivated
in natural ways by using biological inputs to
maintain soil fertility and ecological balance
thereby minimizing pollution and wastage.
Indians were organic farmers by default until
the green revolution came into practice.

Use of biofertilizers is one of the important
components of integrated organic farm
management, as they are cost effective
and renewable source of plant nutrients
to supplement the chemical fertilizers for
sustainable agriculture. Several microorganisms
and their association with crop plants are being
exploited in the production of biofertilizers.
Organic farming is thus considered as the
movement directed towards the philosophy of
**Back to Nature.**

#### I. Organic Pesticide

Pest like aphids, spider and mites can cause
serious damage to flowers, fruits, and vegetables.
These creatures attack the garden in swarms, and
drain the life of the crop and often invite disease
in the process. Many chemical pesticides prove
unsafe for human and the environment. It turns
fruits and vegetables unsafe for consumption.
Thankfully, there are many homemade, organic
options to turn to war against pests.

##### II. Bio-pest repellent

Botanical pest repellent and insecticide made
with the dried leaves of *Azadirachta indica*

**Preparation of Bio-pest repellent**

* 	Pluck leaves from the neem tree and chop
the leaves finely.

*   e chopped up leaves were put in a 50-liter
container and fill to half with water; put the
lid on and leave it for 3 days to brew.

*  sing another container, strain the mixture
which has brewed for 3 days to remove the
leaves, through fine mesh sieve. The filtrate
can be sprayed on the plants to repel pests.

* To make sure that the pest repellent sticks to
the plants, add 100 ml of
cooking oil and the same
amount of soap water.
(The role of the soap water
is to break down the oil,
and the role of the oil is to
make it stick to the leaves).

* The stewed leaves from the mixture can be
used in the compost heap or around the base
of the plants.

### Summary

Early civilization in different parts of the world
has domesticated different species of plants
for various purposes. Based on their utility,
the economically useful plants are classified
into food plants, fibre plants, timber plants,
medicinal plants, and plants used in paper
industries, dyes and cosmetics.

However, food base of majority of the
population depends on very few Cereals,
Millets, Pulses, Vegetables, Fruits, Nuts, Sugars,
Oil seeds, Beverages, Spices and Condiments.

Oils can be classified into two types
namely, essential oils and vegetable oils. Fatty
acids in oil may be saturated or unsaturated.
The oil yielding plants are groundnut and
sesame. The oils are used in cooking, making
soaps and other purposes. Beverages contain
alkaloids that stimulate central nervous
system. Spices were used throughout the
world for several years. Cardamom is ‘Queen
of Spices’ used for flavouring confectionaries
and beverages. Black pepper is King of Spices.


Botanically a fibre is a long, narrow, thick
walled cell. Cotton and Jute are fibre yielding
plants. Teak is wood used for making furniture.
Rubber is produced from the latex of Hevea
brasiliensis. Paper production is a Chinese
invention. Dyes have been used since ancient
times. The orange dye henna is from the leaves of
Lawsonia. Perfumes are volatile and aromatic in
nature, manufactured from essential oils which
are found at different parts of the plant. Medicinal
plants serve as therapeutic agents. Medicinally
useful molecules obtained from these plants
are marketed as drugs are called Biomedicines.
Whereas phytochemicals from some of the
plants which alter an individual’s perceptions of
mind by producing hallucination are known as
psychoactive drugs.
