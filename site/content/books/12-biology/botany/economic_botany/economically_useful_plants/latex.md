**Rubber â€“ Vulcanization**
Charles
Goodyear
invented vulcanization in
1839. He found that the
defects in rubber articles could be overcome
by heating rubber with sulphur under
pressure at 1500 C. The process was called
vulcanization. The name was given from the
Roman God of Fire, Vulcan. Because of this,
solid rubber tyres were used for first time in
1867. That is why we smoothly travel on road.
