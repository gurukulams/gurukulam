Spices are accessory foods mainly used
for flavouring during food preparation to
improve their palatability. Spices are aromatic
plant products and are characterized by sweet
or bitter taste. Spices are added in minimal
quantities during the cooking process. For
example black pepper.

Condiments, on the other hand, are
flavouring substances having a sharp taste and
are usually added to food after cooking. For
