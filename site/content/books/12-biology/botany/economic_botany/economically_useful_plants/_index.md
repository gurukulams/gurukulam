The land and water of the earth sustain a
vast assemblage of plants upon which all
other living forms are directly or indirectly
dependent. Pre-historic humans lived on
berries, tubers, herbage, and the wild game
which they collected and hunted that occupied
whole of their time. Domestication of plants
and animals has led to the production of
surplus food which formed the basis for
civilizations. Early civilization in different
parts of the world has domesticated different
species of plants for various purposes. Based
on their utility, the economically useful plants
are classified into food plants, fodder plants,
fibre plants, timber plants, medicinal plants,
and plants used in paper industries, dyes and
cosmetics. Selected examples of economically
important plants for each category are
discussed in this chapter.
