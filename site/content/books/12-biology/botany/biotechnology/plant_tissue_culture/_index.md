Growing plant
protoplasts, cells, tissues
or organs away from
their natural or normal
environment, under
artificial condition, is
known as Tissue Culture.
It is also known as in vitro
(In vitro is a Latin word,
it means that - in glass
or in test-tube) growth of plant protoplasts,
cells, tissues and organs. A single explant can
be multiplied into several thousand plants in
a short duration and space under controlled 
conditions.

Tissue culture techniques are often used
for commercial production of plants as well as
for plant research. Plant tissue culture serves
as an indispensable tool for regeneration of
transgenic plants. Apart from this some of
the main applications of Plant tissue culture
are clonal propagation of elite varieties,
conservation of endangered plants, production
of virus-free plants, germplasm preservation,
industrial production of secondary metabolites.
etc., In this chapter let us discuss the history ,
techniques, types , applications of plant tissue
culture and get awareness on ethical issues.

Gottlieb Haberlandt (1902) the German
Botanist proposed the concept **Totipotency**
and he was also the first person to culture plant
cells in artificial conditions using the mesophyll
cells of Lamium purpureum in culture medium
and obtained cell proliferation. He is regarded
as the father of tissue culture.

### Basic concepts of Tissue Culture

Basic concepts of plant tissue culture are
totipotency, differentiation, dedifferentiation
and redifferentiation.

#### Totipotency

The property of live plant cells that they
have the genetic potential when cultured in
nutrient medium to give rise to a complete
individual plant.

#### Differentiation

The process of biochemical and structural
changes by which cells become specialized in
form and function.


{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/unit8/img2.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
Figure 5.1: Totipotency
{{< /figure >}}

#### Redifferentiation

The further differentiation of already
differentiated cell into another type of cell.
For example, when the component cells of
callus have the ability to form a whole plant in
a nutrient medium, the phenomenon is called
redifferentiation.

#### Dedifferentiation

The phenomenon of the reversion of mature
cells to the meristematic state leading to the
formation of callus is called dedifferentiation.
These two phenomena of redifferentiation and
dedifferentiation are the inherent capacities of
living plant cells or tissue. This is described as
totipotency. 

### Plant Tissue Culture (PTC)

Plant tissue culture is used to describe the in
*vitro* and aseptic growth of any plant part on a
tissue culture medium. This technology is based
on three fundamental principles:

*	 The plant part or explant must be selected
and isolated from the rest of plant body.

*	 The explant must be maintained in controlled
physically (environmental) and chemically
defined (nutrient medium) conditions.

 Aseptic condition must be maintained,
which requires high degree of cleanliness in
the laboratory.

**Explant:**  The tissue taken from a selected
plant transferred to a culture medium often
to establish a new plant.

#### Laboratory Facilities for PTC 

For PTC, the laboratory must have the following
facilities:

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/unit8/img3.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
Figure 5.2: Tissue culture lab
{{< /figure >}}


* Washing facility for glassware and ovens for
drying glassware.

* Medium preparation room with autoclave,
electronic balance and pH meter.

* Transfer area sterile room with laminar
air-flow bench and a positive pressure
ventilation unit called High Efficiency
Particulate Air (HEPA) filter to maintain
aseptic condition.

* Culture facility: Growing the explant
inoculated into culture tubes at 22-28° C
with illumination of light 2400 lux, with a
photoperiod of 8-16 hours and a relative
humidity of about 60%.

#### Technique Involved in PTC

#### 1. Sterilization:

Sterilization is the technique employed to get
rid of microbes such as bacteria and fungi in the
culture medium, vessels and explants.

#### i. Maintenance of Aseptic Environment:

During in vitro tissue culture maintenance of
aseptic environmental condition should be
followed, i.e., sterilization of glassware, forceps,
scalpels, and all accessories in wet steam
sterilization by autoclaving at 15 psi (121°C)
for 15 to 30 minutes or dipping in 70% ethanol
followed by flaming and cooling.

**ii. Sterilization of culture room:** 
Floor and
walls are washed first with detergent and then
with 2% sodium hypochlorite or 95% ethanol.
The cabinet of laminar airflow is sterilized by
clearing the work surface with 95% ethanol and
then exposure of UV radiation for 15 minutes.


**iii. Sterilization of Nutrient Media:** Culture
media are dispensed in glass containers, plugged
with non-absorbent cotton or sealed with plastic
closures and then sterilized using autoclave at
15 psi (121°C) for 15 to 30 minutes. The plant
extracts, vitamins, amino acids and hormones
are sterilized by passing through Millipore filter
with 0.2 mm pore diameter and then added
to sterilized culture medium inside Laminar
Airflow Chamber under sterile condition.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/unit8/img4.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
Figure 5.3: Basic steps in Plant tissue culture technology
{{< /figure >}}

**iv. Sterilization of Explants:** The plant
materials to be used for tissue culture should be
surface sterilized by first exposing the material
in running tap water and then treating it in
surface sterilization agents like 0.1% mercuric
chloride, 70% ethanol under aseptic condition
inside the Laminar Air Flow Chamber.

**2. Media Preparation**

The success of tissue culture lies in the
composition of the growth medium, plant
growth regulators and culture conditions
such as temperature, pH, light and humidity.
No single medium is capable of maintaining
optimum growth of all plant tissues. Suitable
nutrient medium as per the principle of tissue
culture is prepared and used.

MS nutrient medium (Murashige and Skoog
1962) is commonly used. It has carbon sources,
with suitable vitamins and hormones. The media
formulations available for plant tissue culture
other than MS are B5 medium (Gamborg.et.al
1968), White medium (white 1943), Nitsch’s
medium (Nitsch & Nitsch 1969). A medium may
be solid or semisolid or liquid. For solidification,
a gelling agent such as agar is added.

**Agar:** A complex mucilaginous polysaccharide
obtained from marine algae (sea weeds) used
as solidifying agent in media preparation.

### 3. Culture condition

**pH**

The pH of medium is normally adjusted between
5.6 to 6.0 for the best result.

**Temperature**

The cultures should be incubated normally at
constant temperature of 25°C ± 2°C for optimal
growth.

**Humidity and Light Intensity**

The cultures require 50-60% relative humidity
and 16 hours of photoperiod by the illumination
of cool white fluorescent tubes of approximately
1000 lux.

**Aeration**

Aeration to the culture can be provided by
shaking the flasks or tubes of liquid culture on
automatic shaker or aeration of the medium by
passing with filter-sterilized air.


4. Induction of Callus
Explant of 1-2 cm
sterile
segment
selected from leaf,
stem,
tuber
or
root is inoculated
(transferring
the
explants to sterile
glass tube containing
nutrient
medium)

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/unit8/img5.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
Figure 5.4: Induction of callus 
{{< /figure >}}


in the MS nutrient medium supplemented
with auxins and incubated at 25°C ± 2°C in an
alternate light and dark period of 12 hours to
induce cell division and soon the upper surface
of explant develops into callus. Callus is a mass
of unorganized growth of plant cells or tissues
in in vitro culture medium.

### 5. Embryogenesis

The callus cells undergoes
differentiation and produces
somatic embryos, known as
**Embryoids.** The embryoids
are sub-cultured to produce
plantlets.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/unit8/img6.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
Figure 5.5: Embryogenesis 
{{< /figure >}}

### 6. Hardening

The plantlets developed in vitro require a
hardening period and so are transferred to
greenhouse or hardening chamber and then to
normal environmental conditions.

Hardening is the gradual exposure of in vitro
developed plantlets in humid chambers in
diffused light for acclimatization so as to enable
them to grow under normal field conditions.

#### Types of Plant tissue cultures
Based on the type of explants other plant tissue
culture types are

1. Organ culture
2. Meristem culture
3. Protoplast culture
4. Cell suspension culture.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/unit8/img7.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
Figure 5.6: Organ Culture
{{< /figure >}}

The culture of embryos, anthers, ovaries, roots,
shoots or other organs of plants on culture media.

**2. Meristem Culture:**


The culture of any plant meristematic tissue on
culture media.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/unit8/img8.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
Figure 5.7: Meristem Culture
{{< /figure >}}

**3. Protoplast Culture:**

Protoplasts are cells without a cell wall, but
bound by a cell membrane or plasma membrane.
Using protoplasts, it is possible to regenerate

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/unit8/img9.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
Figure 5.8: Protoplast Culture
{{< /figure >}}

whole plants from single cells and also develop
somatic hybrids. The steps involved in protoplast
culture.

**i. Isolation of protoplast:** Small bits of plant
tissue like leaf tissue are used for isolation of
protoplast. The leaf tissue is immersed in 0.5%
Macrozyme and 2% Onozuka cellulase enzymes
dissolved in 13% sorbitol or mannitol at pH 5.4.
It is then incubated over-night at 25°C. After a
gentle teasing of cells, protoplasts are obtained,
and these are then transferred to 20% sucrose
solution to retain their viability. They are then
centrifuged to get pure protoplasts as different
from debris of cell walls.

**ii. Fusion of protoplast:** It is done through the
use of a suitable fusogen. This is normally PEG
(Polyethylene Glycol). The isolated protoplast
are incubated in 25 to 30% concentration of
PEG with Ca++ ions and the protoplast shows
agglutination (the formation of clumps of cells)
and fusion.

**iii. Culture of protoplast:** MS liquid medium
is used with some modification in
droplet, plating or micro-drop array
techniques. Protoplast viability is
tested with fluorescein diacetate
before the culture. The cultures
are incubated in continuous light
1000-2000 lux at 25°C. The cell
wall formation occurs within 24-
48 hours and the first division of
new cells occurs between 2-7 days
of culture.

**iv. Selection of somatic hybrid cells:** The fusion product of
protoplasts without nucleus of
different cells is called a cybrid.
Following this nuclear fusion take
place. This process is called somatic
hybridization.

**4. Cell Suspension Culture**

The growing of cells including
the culture of single cells or small
aggregates of cells in vitro in liquid medium
is known as cell suspension culture. The cell
suspension is prepared by transferring a
portion of callus to the liquid medium and
agitated using rotary shaker instrument. The
cells are separated from the callus tissue and
used for cell suspension culture.

**Production of Secondary Metabolites**

Cell suspension culture can be useful for the
production of secondary metabolites like
alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, phenolic
compounds and recombinant proteins.
Secondary metabolites are chemical compounds
that are not required by the plant for normal
growth and development but are produced in
the plant as ‘byproducts’ of cell metabolism. For
Example: Biosynthesis and isolation of indole
alkaloids from *Catharanthus* roseus plant cell
culture.

The process of production of secondary
metabolites can be scaled up and automated
using bio-reactors for commercial production.
Many strategies such as biotransformation,
elicitation and immobilization have been
used to make cell suspension cultures more
efficient in the production of secondary
metabolites. Few examples of industrially
important plant secondary metabolites
are listed below in the table:

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/unit8/img10.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
Table 5.1: Secondary metabolites and its plant resources
{{< /figure >}}

### Plant Regeneration Pathway

From the explants, plants can be regenerated by
somatic embryogenesis or organogenesis.


{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/unit8/img12.png" "w-25 float-end">}}

Figure 5.10: Plant Regeneration Pathway
{{< /figure >}}



#### Somatic Embryogenesis

Somatic embryogenesis is the formation of
embryos from the callus tissue directly and
these embryos are called Embryoids or from
the in vitro cells directly form pre-embryonic
cells which differentiate into embryoids.


**Applications**


*  Somatic embryogenesis provides potential
plantlets which after hardening period can
establish into plants.

*  Somatic embryoids can be be used for the
production of synthetic seeds.

*  Somatic embryogenesis is now reported
in many plants such as Allium sativum,
Hordeum vulgare, Oryza sativa, Zea mays
and this possible in any plant.

Synthetic seeds are produced by encapsulation
of embryoids in agarose gel or calcium alginate.

#### Organogenesis


The morphological changes occur in the callus
leading to the formation of shoot and roots is
called organogenesis.

* Organogenesis can be induced in vitro by
introducing plant growth regulators in the MS
medium.
* Auxin and cytokinins induce shoot and root
formation.

### Applications of Plant Tissue Culture

Plant tissue culture techniques have several
applications such as:

i. Improved hybrids production through
somatic hybridization. 

ii.	Somatic embryoids can be encapsulated
into synthetic seeds (synseeds). These
encapsulated seeds or synthetic seeds help
in conservation of plant biodiversity.


iii.Production of disease resistant plants
through meristem and shoot tip culture.

iv.	Production of stress resistant plants like
herbicide tolerant, heat tolerant plants.

v. Micropropagation technique to obtain
large numbers of plantlets of both crop and
tree species useful in forestry within a short
span of time and all through the year.

vi.Production of secondary metabolites from
cell culture utilized in pharmaceutical,
cosmetic and food industries.

**Somaclonal variations:** Somatic variations
found in plants regenerated in vitro (i.e.
variations found in leaf, stem, root, tuber or
propagule)

**Gametoclonal variations:** Gametophytic
variations found in plants regenerated in
vitro gametic origin (i.e. variations found in
gametes and gametophytes)



#### Micropropagation of Banana

Micropropagation of plants at industrial level
maintains high standards of homogeneity in
plants like pineapple, banana, strawberry and
potato.



{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/unit8/img13.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
Figure 5.11: Micropropagation of Banana
{{< /figure >}}

#### Artificial Seed

Artificial seeds or synthetic seeds (synseeds)
are produced by using embryoids (somatic
embryos) obtained through in vitro culture.
They may even be derived from single cells
from any part of the plant that later divide to
form cell mass containing dense cytoplasm,
large nuclceus, starch grains, proteins, and oils
etc., To prepare the artificial seeds different
inert materials are used for coating the somatic
embryoids like agrose and sodium alginate.


{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/unit8/img14.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
Figure 5.12: Artificial seeds
{{< /figure >}}

**Advantages of Artificial seeds**

Artificial seeds have many advantages over the
true seeds

* Millions of artificial seeds can be produced
at any time at low cost.

* They provide an easy method to produce
genetically engineered plants with desirable
traits.

* It is easy to test the genotype of plants.
They can potentially stored for long time
under cryopreservation method.

* Artificial seeds produce identical plants
The period of dormancy of artificial seeds is
greatly reduced, hence growth is faster with
a shortened life cycle.

#### Virus-free plants

The field grown plants like perennial crops,
usually are infected by variety of pathogens
like fungi, bacteria, mycoplasma, viruses which
cause considerable economic losses. Chemical
methods can be used to control fungal and
bacterial pathogens, but not viruses generally.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/unit8/img15.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
Figure 5.13: Shoot tip - Apical Meristem
{{< /figure >}}

Shoot meristem tip culture is the method to produce virus-free plants, because the shoot
meristem tip is always free from viruses.

### Conservation of plant genetic resources

5.6.1 Germplasm Conservation
Germplasm conservation refers to the
conservation of living genetic resources like
pollen, seeds or tissue of plant material
maintained for the purpose of selective plant
breeding, preservation in live condition and
used for many research works.
Germplasm conservation resources is a
part of collection of seeds and pollen that are
stored in seed or pollen banks, so as to maintain
their viability and fertility for any later use
such as hybridization and crop improvement.
Germplasm conservation
may also involve a
gene bank, DNA bank
of elite breeding lines
of plant resources for
the maintenance of
biological diversity and
also for food security.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/unit8/img16.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
Figure 5.15: Seed bank
{{< /figure >}}


#### Cryopreservation (–195.C)

Cryopreservation, also known as Cryo-
conservation, is a
process by which
protoplasts,
cells,
tissues,
organelles, organs,
extracellular
matrix, enzymes Figure 5.16: Cryopreservation
or any other
biological materials are subjected to preservation
by cooling to very low temperature of –196°C
using liquid nitrogen. At this extreme low
temperature any enzymatic or chemical activity
of the biological material will be totally stopped
and this leads to preservation of material in
dormant status. Later these materials can be
activated by bringing to room temperature slowly
for any experimental work.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/unit8/img17.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
Figure 5.16: Cryopreservation
{{< /figure >}}

Protective agents like dimethyl sulphoxide,
glycerol or sucrose are added before
cryopreservation process. These protective
agents are called cryoprotectants, since they
protect the cells, or tissues from the stress of
freezing temperature.

### Intellectual Property Right (IPR)

Intellectual property right (IPR) is a category
of rights that includes intangible creation of
the human intellect, and primarily consists
of copyrights, patents, and trademarks. It also
includes other types of rights, such as trade
secrets, publicity rights, moral rights, and rights
against unfair competition.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/unit8/img18.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
Figure 5.17: IPR in India
{{< /figure >}}

* In biotechnology, the
transformed microorganisms and plants and technologies
for the production of commercial products
are exclusively the property of the discoverer.

* The discoverer has the full rights on his
property. It should not be neglected by the
others without legal permission.

* The right of discoverer must be protected
and it does by certain laws framed by a
country.

* The IPR is protected by different ways
like patents, copyrights, trade secrets and
trademarks, designs and geographical
indications.

#### Patents

* It is a special right to the discoverer/inventor
that has been granted by the government
through legislation for trading new articles.

* A patent is a personal property which
can be licensed or sold by the person or
organisation just like any other property.

* Patent terms give the inventor the rights to
exclude others from making, using or selling
his invention.

#### Biosafety and Bioethics

Advances in biotechnology and their
applications deals with genetic manipulation.

**Biosafety**

Biosafety is the prevention of large-scale
loss of biological integrity, focusing both on
ecology and human health. These prevention
mechanisms include conduction of regular
reviews of the biosafety in laboratory settings,
as well as strict guidelines to follow. Many
laboratories handling biohazards employ an
ongoing risk management assessment and
enforcement process for biosafety. Failures to
follow such protocols can lead to increased risk
of exposure to biohazards or pathogens.

**Bioethics - Ethical, Implications (ELSI) Legal and Social**

Bioethics refers to the study of ethical issues
emerging from advances in biology and
medicine. It is also a moral discernment
as it relates to medical policy and practice.
Bioethicists are concerned with the ethical
questions that arise in the relationships among
life sciences, biotechnology and medicine. It
includes the study of values relating to primary
care and other branches of medicine.

The scope of bioethics is directly related to
biotechnology, including cloning, gene therapy,
life extension, human genetic engineering,
astroethics life in space, and manipulation of
basic biology through altered DNA, RNA and
proteins. These developments in biotechnology
will affect future evolution, and may require new
principles, such as biotic ethics, that values life
and its basic biological characters and structures.
The Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications
(ELSI) program was founded in 1990 as an
integral part of the Human Genome Project. The
mission of the ELSI program was to identify and
address issues raised by genomic research that
would affect individuals, families, and society.
A percentage of the Human Genome Project
budget at the National Institutes of Health and
the U.S. Department of Energy was devoted to
ELSI research.

### Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC)

GEAC is an apex body under Ministry of
Environment, Forests and Climate change for
regulating manufacturing, use, import, export
and storage of hazardous microbes or genetically
modified organisms (GMOs) and cells in the
country. It was established as an apex body to accord
approval of activities involving large scale use of
hazardous microorganisms and recombinants in
research and industrial production. The GEAC is
also responsible for approval of proposals relating
to release of genetically engineered organisms
and products into the environment including
experimental field trials.

### Future of Biotechnology

Biotechnology has become a comprehensive
scientific venture from the point of academic
and commercial angles, within a short time with
the sequencing of human genome and genome
of some important organisms. The future
developments in biotechnology will be exciting.
Thus the development in biotechnology will lead
to a new scientific revolution that would change
the lives and future of people. Like industrial
and computer revolution, biotechnological
revolution will also promise major changes in
many aspects of modern life.

### Summary

Tissue culture is the in vitro asceptic culture of
cells, tissues or organs into whole plants under
controlled nutritional and environmental
conditions. A German physiologist Gotllieb
Haberlant in 1902 for the first time attempted
to culture plant cells in artificial medium,
hence he was regarded as father of Tissue
culture. Tissue culture mainly based on
the concepts totipotency, differentiation,
redifferentiation and dedifferentiation. Plant
tissue culture technique involves selection
of explants, sterilization, media preparation,
maintaining culture condition, callus formation,
embryogenesis or organgenesis and hardening.
Based on the explants chosen the types of tissue
culture are organ culture, meristem culture,
protoplast culture and cell suspension culture.
From the explants, plants can be regenerated
by somatic embryogenesis or organgenesis is
said to be plant regeneration pathway. Some
of the main applications of tissue culture are
production of somatic hybrids, artificial seeds,
disease resistant and stress resistant plants,
germplasm conservation, micropropagation
and production of secondary metabolites.
Intellectual Property Right (IPR) is primarily
aimed at patents, copyrights, trade secret and
trademark given to the discoverer / inventor
for the commercial production of transformed
micro organisms or plants. Biosafety is the
prevention mechanism to protect harmful
incidents due to biohazards or pathogens.
Bioethics dealt with ethical issue emerging from
biotechnological advancement. ELSI program
addresses issues related to genenomic research.
GEAC (Genetic Engineering Appraisal
Committee) is a regulatory authority for release
of genetically modified products or organisms
into the environment.
