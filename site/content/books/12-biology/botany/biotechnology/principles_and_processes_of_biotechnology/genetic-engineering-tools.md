### Advancements in Modern Biotechnology

Modern biotechnology embraces all the
genetic manipulations, protoplasmic fusion
techniques and the improvements made in
the old biotechnological processes. Some
of the major advancements in modern
biotechnology are described below.

#### Genetic Engineering

Genetic engineering or recombinant DNA
technology or gene cloning is a collective term
that includes different experimental protocols
resulting in the modification and transfer of
DNA from one organism to another.

The definition for conventional
recombination was already given in Unit
II. Conventional recombination involves
exchange or recombination of genes between
homologous chromosomes during meiosis.
Recombination carried out artificially using
modern technology is called recombinant
DNA technology (r-DNA technology). It is
also known as gene manipulation technique.
This technique involves the transfer of DNA
coding for a specific gene from one organism
into another organism using specific
agents like vectors or using instruments
like electroporation, gene gun, liposome
mediated, chemical mediated transfers and
microinjection.

#### Steps involved in Recombinant DNA Technology 

**The steps involved in recombinant DNA technology are:**

- Isolation of a DNA fragment containing a gene of interest that needs to be cloned. This is called an insert. 

PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction is a common
laboratory technique used to make copies
(millions) of a particular region of DNA.

- Generation of recombinant DNA (rDNA) molecule by insertion of the DNA fragment into a carrier molecule called a vector that can self-replicate within the host cell.

- Selection of the transformed host cells is carrying the rDNA and allowing them to multiply thereby multiplying the rDNA molecule.

- The entire process thus generates either a large amount of rDNA or a large amount of protein expressed by the insert.

- Wherever vectors are not involved the desired gene is multiplied by PCR technique. The multiple copies are injected into the host cell protoplast or it is shot into the host cell protoplast by shot gun method.
