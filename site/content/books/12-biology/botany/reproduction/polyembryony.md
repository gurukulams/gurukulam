Occurrence of more than one embryo in a
seed is called polyembryony (Figure 1.24).
The first case of polyembryony was reported
in certain oranges by Anton von Leeuwenhoek
in the year 1719. Polyembryony is divided into
four categories based on its origin.

a. **Cleavage polyembryony** (Example: Orchids)


b. **Formation of embryo by cells of the **Embryo**
**sac** other than egg** (Synergids – *Aristolochia*;
antipodals – *Ulmus* and endosperm –
*Balanophora*)


c. **Development of more than one Embryo sac**
**within the same ovule.** (Derivatives of same
MMC, derivatives of two or more MMC –
*Casuarina*)


d. **Activation of some sporophytic cells of **the**
**ovule**** (Nucellus/ integuments-*Citrus* and
*Syzygium*).


**Practical applications**


The seedlings formed from the nucellar tissue
in Citrus are found better clones for Orchards.
Embryos derived through polyembryony are
found virus free.
