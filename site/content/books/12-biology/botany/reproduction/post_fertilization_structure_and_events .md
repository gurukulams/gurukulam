After fertilization, several changes take place in
the floral parts up to the formation of the seed
(Figure 1.20).

The events after fertilization (endosperm,
embryo development, formation of seed, fruits)
are called fertilization changes.

##### Endosperm


The primary endosperm nucleus (PEN)
divides immediately after fertilization but
before the zygote starts to divide, to form
the endosperm. The primary endosperm
nucleus is the result of triple fusion (two
polar nuclei and one sperm nucleus) and
thus has 3n number of chromosomes. It is
a nutritive tissue and regulatory structure
that nourishes the developing embryo.



Depending upon the mode of development
three types of endosperm are recognized in
angiosperms. They are nuclear endosperm,
cellular endosperm and helobial endosperm
(Figure 1.21).


**Nuclear endosperm**: Primary Endosperm
Nucleus undergoes several mitotic divisions
without cell wall formation thus a free nuclear
condition exists in the endosperm. Examples:
*Coccinia*, *Capsella* and *Arachis*



**Cellular endosperm**: Primary endosperm
nucleus divides into 2 nuclei and it is
immediately followed by wall formation.
Subsequent divisions also follow cell wall
formation. Examples: *Adoxa*, *Helianthus* and
*Scoparia*

**Helobial endosperm**: Primary Endosperm
Nucleus moves towards base of embryo sac and
divides into two nuclei. Cell wall formation
takes place leading to the formation of a large
micropylar and small chalazal chamber. The
nucleus of the micropylar chamber undergoes
several free nuclear division whereas that
of chalazal chamber may or may not divide.
Examples : *Hydrilla* and *Vallisneria*.


The endosperms may either be completely
consumed by the developing embryo or it may
persist in the mature seeds. Those seeds without
endosperms are called non- endospermous or
ex- albuminous seeds. Examples: Pea, Groundnut and Beans. Those seeds with endosperms are
called endospermous or albuminous seeds. The
endosperms in these seeds supply nutrition to
the embryo during seed germination. Examples:
Paddy, Coconut and Castor.

**Ruminate endosperm**: The endosperm with
irregularity and unevenness in its surface forms
ruminate endosperm. Examples :*Areca catechu,*
*Passiflora* and *Myristica*


**Functions of endosperm:**


•	It is the nutritive tissue for the developing
embryo.


•  In majority of angiosperms, the zygote
divides only after the development of
endosperm.


•	Endosperm regulates the precise mode of embryo development.

**Development of Dicot embryo**


The Stages involved in the development
of Dicot embryo (*Capsella bursa-pastoris* –
Onagrad or crucifer type) is given in Figure
1.22. The embryo develops at micropylar
end of embryo sac. The zygote undergoes
transverse division to form upper or terminal
cell and lower or basal cell. Further divisions
in the zygote during the development lead to
the formation of embryo. Embryo undergoes
globular, heart shaped stages before reaching a
mature stage. The mature embryo has a **radicle**,
two **cotyledons** and a **plumule**.

##### Seed

The fertilized ovule is called seed and possesses
an embryo, endosperm and a protective coat.
Seeds may be endospermous (wheat, maize,
barley and sunflower) or non endospermo.

**Cicer seed (example for Dicot seed)**
The mature seeds are attached to the fruit
wall by a stalk called **funiculus**. The funiculus
disappears leaving a scar called **hilum**. Below
the hilum a small pore called **micropyle** is
present. It facilitates entry of oxygen and
water into the seeds during germination.
Each seed has a thick outer covering called
seed coat. The seed coat is developed from
integuments of the ovule. The outer coat is
called **testa** and is hard whereas the inner coat
is thin, membranous and is called **tegmen**.
In Pea plant the tegmen and testa are fused.
Two cotyledons laterally attached to the
embryonic axis and store the food materials
in pea whereas in other seeds like castor the

**Figure 1.23(a)**
Dicot
- *Cicer arientinum*
endosperm contains reserve food and the
cotyledons are thin. The portion of embryonal
Fruit (Caryopsis) entire
axis projecting beyond the cotyledons is
called **radicle** or embryonic root. The other
end of the axis called embryonic shoot is
the **plumule**. Embryonal axis above the
Endosperm
level of cotyledon is called **epicotyl** whereas
Scutellum the level of
the cylindrical region between
Coleoptile
cotyledon is called **hypocotyl**(Figure
1.23 a).



**Oryza seed (example for Monocot seed)**

The seed of paddy is one seeded and is called
**Caryopsis**. Each seed remains enclosed by
a brownish husk which consists of glumes
arranged in two rows. The seed coat is a
brownish, membranous layer closely adhered to
the grain. Endosperm forms the bulk of the grain
and is the storage tissue. It is separated from
embryo by a definite layer called **epithelium**.
The embryo is small and consists of one shield-
shaped cotyledon known as **scutellum** present
towards lateral side of embryonal axis.



A short axis with plumule and radicle protected
by the **root** **cap** is present. The plumule is
surrounded by a protective sheath called
**coleoptile**. The radicle including root cap
is also covered by a protective sheath called
**coleorhiza**. The scutellum supplies the growing
embryo with food material absorbed from the
endosperm with the help of the epithelium
(Figure 1.23 b).
