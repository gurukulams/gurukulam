The reproduction method which helps
to perpetuate its own species without the
involvement of gametes is referred to as asexual
reproduction. From Unit I of Class XI we
know that reproduction is one of the attributes
of living things and the different types of
reproduction have also been discussed. Lower
plants, fungi and animals show different methods
of asexual reproduction. Some of the methods
include, formation of Conidia (*Aspergillus*
and **Penicillium*); Budding (*Yeast* and *Hydra*);
Fragmentation (*Spirogyra*); production of
Gemma (*Marchantia*); Regeneration (*Planaria*)
and Binary fission (*Bacteria*) (Refer chapter 1 of
Unit I of class XI). The individuals formed by
this method is morphologically and genetically
identical and are called **clones**. Higher plants
also reproduce asexually by different methods
which are given below:
