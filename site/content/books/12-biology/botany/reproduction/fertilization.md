The fusion of male and female
gamete is called **fertilization**.
**Double fertilization** is seen in
angiosperms.

**Events of fertilization**



The stages involved in double
fertilization are:- germination
of pollen to form pollen tube
in the stigma; growth of pollen
tube in the style; direction
of pollen tube towards the micropyle of the
ovule; entry of the pollen tube into one of the
synergids of the embryo sac, discharge of
male gametes; syngamy and triple fusion. The
events from pollen deposition on the stigma to
the entry of pollen tube in to the ovule is called
**pollen- pistil interaction**. It is a dynamic
process which involves recognition of pollen
and to promote or inhibit its germination and
growth.



##### Pollen on the stigma



In nature, a variety of pollens fall on the receptive
stigma, but all of them do not germinate and
bring out fertilization. The receptive surface
of the stigma receives the pollen. If the pollen
is compatible with the stigma it germinates to
form a tube. This is facilitated by the stigmatic
fluid in **wet stigma** and pellicle in **dry stigma**.
These two also decide the incompatibility and compatibility of the pollen through **recognition**-
**rejection protein reaction** between the pollen
and stigma surface. Sexual incompatibility may
exist between different species (interspecific)
or between members of the same species
(intraspecific).The latter is called self-
incompatibility. The first visible change in the
pollen, soon after it lands on stigma is hydration.
The pollen wall proteins are released from the
surface. During the germination of pollen its
entire content moves into the pollen tube. The
growth is restricted to the tip of the tube and
all the cytoplasmic contents move to the tip
region. The remaining part of the pollen tube
is occupied by a vacuole which is cut off from
the tip by callose plug. The extreme tip of pollen
tube appears hemispherical and transparent
when viewed through the microscope. This
is called **cap block**. As soon as the cap block
disappear the growth of the pollen tube stops.

**Pollination – A composite event**

Pollination
provides
information
about
evolution, ecology, animal learning and
foraging behaviour. Flowers not only supply
nectar but also provide microclimate, site and
shelter for egg laying insects. The association
of insects benefits the flower by getting
pollinated and ensures the propagation
of its own progeny. The floral parts are
well modified in shape, size to attract the
pollinators to accomplish pollination .

The relationship between Yucca and
moth (Tegeticula yuccasella) is an example
for obligate mutualism. The moth bores a
hole in the ovary of the flower and lays eggs
in it. Then it collects pollen and pushes it
in the form of balls down the hollow end
of the stigma. Fertilization takes place and
seeds develop. Larvae
feed on developing seeds.
Some seeds remain
unconsumed for the
propagation of the plant
species. It is interesting
that the moth cannot
survive without Yucca
flowers and the plant fails
to reproduce sexually
without the moth.

Similarly in Amorphophallus, flowers
apart from providing floral rewards, also
forms safe site for laying eggs. Many visitors
consume pollen and nectar and do not help
in pollination. They are called pollen / nectar
robbers.

In Bee orchid (Ophrys) the morphology
of the flower mimics that of female wasp
(Colpa). The male wasp mistakes the flowers
for a female wasp and tries to copulate. This
act of pseudocopulation helps in polli nation.
The pollination in Fig (Ficus carica) by the
Wasp (Blastophaga psenes) is also an example
for similar Plant – insect interaction.

##### Pollen tube in the style


After the germination the pollen tube enters into
the style from the stigma. The growth of the pollen
tube in the style depends on the type of style.



**Types of style**



There are three types of style a) Hollow or
open style b)solid style or closed style c) semi-
solid or half closed style.






**Hollow style (Open style)**: It is common
among monocots. A hollow canal running from
the stigma to the base of the style is present.
The canal is lined by a single layer of glandular
canal cells (Transmitting tissue).They secrete
mucilaginous substances. The pollen tube grows
on the surface of the cells lining the stylar canal.
The canal is filled with secretions which serve
as nutrition for growing pollen tubes and also
controlling incompatibility reaction between
the style and pollen tube. The secretions contain
carbohydrates, lipids and some enzymes
like esterases, acid phosphatases as well as
compatibility controlling proteins.


**Solid style (Closed type)**: It is common among
dicots. It is characterized by the presence of
central core of elongated, highly specialised
cells called transmitting tissue.This is equivalent
to the lining cells of hollow style and does the
same function. Its contents are also similar
to the content of those cells. The pollen tube
grows through the intercellular spaces of the
transmitting tissue.





**Semi-solid style (half closed type)**: This is
intermediate between solid and open type.





There is a difference of opinion on the
nature of transmitting tissue. Some authors
consider that it is found only in solid styles
while others consider the lining cells of hollow
style also has transmitting tissue.






**Entry of pollen tube into the ovule**: There
are three types of pollen tube entry into the
ovule(Figure 1.18).

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/images/1.25.png )


**Porogamy**: when the pollen tube enters
through the micropyle.


**Chalazogamy**: when the pollen tube enters
through the chalaza.


**Mesogamy**: when the pollen tube enters
through the integument.




##### Entry of pollen tube into embryo sac:
Irrespective of the place of entry of pollen
tube into ovule, it enters the embryo sac at the
micropylar end. The pollen enters into embryo
sac directly into one of the synergids.



The growth of pollen tube towards the ovary,
ovule and embryo sac is due to the presence of
chemotropic substances. The pollen tube after
travelling the whole length of the style enters
into the ovary locule where it is guided towards
the micropyle of the ovule by a structure called
obturator (See Do you know). After reaching the
embryo sac, a pore is formed in pollen tube wall at
its apex or just behind the apex. The content of the
pollen tube (two male gametes, vegetative nucleus
and cytoplasm) are discharged into the synergids
into which pollen tube enters. The pollen tube
does not grow beyond it, in the embryo sac. The
tube nucleus disorganizes.



##### 1.5.1 Double fertilization and triple fusion


S.G. Nawaschin and L.Guignard in 1898 and
1899, observed in *Lilium* and *Fritillaria* that
both the male gametes released from a male
gametophyte are involved in the fertilization.
They fertilize two different components of
the embryo sac. Since both the male gametes
are involved in fertilization, the phenomenon
is called **double** **fertilization** and is unique
to angiosperms. One of the male gametes
fuses with the egg nucleus (syngamy) to form
Zygote. (Figure 1.19)



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/images/1.26.png )


The second gamete migrates to the central cell
where it fuses with the **polar** **nuclei** or their 
fusion product, the secondary nucleus and
forms the **primary endosperm nucleus (PEN).**
Since this involves the fusion of three nuclei,
this phenomenon is called **triple fusion**. This
act results in endosperm formation which
forms the nutritive tissue for the embryo.
