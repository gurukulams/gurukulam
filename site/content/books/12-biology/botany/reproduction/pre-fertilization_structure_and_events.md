The hormonal and structural changes
in plant lead to the differentiation and
development of floral primordium

The structures and events involved in prefertilization are given below 


#### Male Reproductive part -Androecium

Androecium is made up of stamens. Each
stamen possesses an anther and a filament.
Anther bears pollen grains which represent
the male gametophyte. In this chapter we
shall discuss the structure and development of
anther in detail.  

#### Development of anther:

 A very young
anther develops as a homogenous mass of
cells surrounded by an epidermis. During
its development, the anther assumes a fourlobed structure. In each lobe, a row or a few
rows of hypodermal cells becomes enlarged
with conspicuous nuclei. This functions as
archesporium. The archesporial cells divide
by periclinal divisions to form primary
parietal cells towards the epidermis and
primary sporogenous cells towards the inner
side of the anther. The primary parietal cells
undergo a series of periclinal and anticlinal
division and form 2-5 layers of anther walls
composed of endothecium, middle layers and
tapetum, from periphery to centre. 


**Microsporogenesis**: 

The stages involved
in the formation of haploid microspores from
diploid microspore mother cell through meiosis
is called **Microsporogenesis**. The primary
sporogeneous cells directly, or may undergo
a few mitotic divisions to form **sporogenous**
**tissue**. The last generation of sporogenous tissue
functions as microspore mother cells. Each
microspore mother cell divides meiotically
to form a tetrad of four haploid microspores
(microspore tetrad). Microspores soon separate
from one another and remain free in the anther
locule and develop into pollen grains. The stages
in the development of microsporangia is given in
Figure 1.4. In some plants, all the microspores in
a microsporangium remain held together called
pollinium. Example: *Calotropis*. Pollinia are attached 
to a clamp or clip like sticky structure
called **corpusculum**. The filamentous or thread
like part arising from each pollinium is called
**retinaculum**. The whole structure looks like
inverted letter 'Y' and is called **translator**

#### T.S. of Mature anther


Transverse section of mature anther reveals
the presence of anther cavity surrounded by an
anther wall. It is bilobed, each lobe having 2 theca
(dithecous). A typical anther is tetrasporangiate.
The T.S. of Mature anther is given in Figure 1.5.


**1. Anther wall**


The mature anther wall consists of the
following layers **a. Epidermis** **b. Endothecium**
**c. Middle layers d. Tapetum.**


**a. Epidermis**: 

It is single layered and protective
in function. The cells undergo repeated
anticlinal divisions to cope up with the rapidly
enlarging internal tissues.

{{< box title="Activity" type="objective" >}}

Collect buds and opened flowers of Datura
metel. Dissect the stamens, separate the
anthers and take thin transverse sections and
observe the structure under the microscope.
Record the various stages of anther
development from your observations.

{{< /box >}}

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/images/1.8.png )


**b.Endothecium**: 

It is generally a single layer
of radially elongated cells found below the
epidermis. The inner tangential wall develops
bands (sometimes radial walls also) of α cellulose
(sometimes also slightly lignified). The cells are
**hygroscopic**. In the anthers of aquatic plants, 
saprophytes, cleistogamous flowers and extreme
parasites endothecial differentiation is absent.
The cells along the junction of the two sporangia
of an anther lobe lack these thickenings. This
region is called **stomium**. This region along with
the hygroscopic nature of endothecium helps in
the dehiscence of anther at maturity.   


**c. Middle layers**:

 Two to three layers of
cells next to endothecium constitute middle
layers. They are generally ephemeral. They
disintegrate or get crushed during maturity.


**d. Tapetum**: 

It is the innermost layer of anther
wall and attains its maximum development at the
tetrad stage of microsporogenesis. It is derived
partly from the peripheral wall layer and partly
from the connective tissue of the anther lining
the anther locule. Thus, the tapetum is dual in
origin. It nourishes the developing sporogenous
tissue, microspore mother cells and microspores.
The cells of the tapetum may remain uninucleate
or may contain more than one nucleus or
the nucleus may become polyploid. It also
contributes to the wall materials, sporopollenin,
pollenkitt, tryphine and number of proteins that
control incompatibility reaction .Tapetum also
controls the fertility or sterility of the microspores
or pollen grains.


There are two types of tapetum based on its
behaviour. They are:


**Secretory** **tapetum** 

(parietal/glandular/
cellular): The tapetum retains the original
position and cellular integrity and nourishes
the developing microspores.


**Invasive** **tapetum** (periplasmodial):

 The
cells loose their inner tangential and radial
walls and the protoplast of all tapetal cells
coalesces to form a periplasmodium.


**Functions of Tapetum**:


• It supplies nutrition to the developing microspores.


• It contributes sporopollenin through **ubisch bodies** thus plays an important role in pollen wall formation.

The pollenkitt material is contributed by
tapetal cells and is later transferred to the
pollen surface.


Exine proteins responsible for **‘rejection**
**reaction’** of the stigma are present in the
cavities of the exine. These proteins are
derived from tapetal cells.

{{< box title="Do You Know" type="dyn" >}}

Many botanists speak of a
third type of tapetum called
amoeboid, where the cell wall
is not lost. The cells protrude
into the anther cavity through an amoeboid
movement. This type is often associated with
male sterility and should not be confused with
periplasmodial type.

{{< /box >}}

**2. Anther Cavity** : The anther cavity is filled with
microspores in young stages or with pollen grains
at maturity. The meiotic division of microspore
mother cells gives rise to microspores which are
haploid in nature.


**3. Connective**: It is the column of sterile tissue
surrounded by the anther lobe. It possesses
vascular tissues. It also contributes to the
inner tapetum.

#### Microspores and pollen grains


Microspores are the immediate product of
meiosis of the microspore mother cell whereas
the pollen grain is derived from the microspore.
The microspores have protoplast surrounded
by a wall which is yet to be fully developed. The
pollen protoplast consists of dense cytoplasm
with a centrally located nucleus. The wall is
differentiated into two layers, namely, inner
layer called **intine** and outer layer called **exine**.
Intine is thin, uniform and is made up of pectin,
hemicellulose, cellulose and callose together
with proteins. Exine is thick and is made up
of cellulose, sporopollenin and pollenkitt. The
exine is not uniform and is thin at certain areas.
When these thin areas are small and round it is
called germ pores or when elongated it is called
furrows. It is associated with germination of
pollen grains. The sporopollenin is generally absent in germ pores.The surface of the exine
is either smooth or sculptured in various
patterns (rod like, grooved, warty, punctuate
etc.) The sculpturing pattern is used in the
plant identification and classification.


Shape of a pollen grain varies from species
to species. It may be globose, ellipsoid, fusiform,
lobed, angular or crescent shaped. The size of the
pollen varies from 10 micrometers in Myosotis
to 200 micrometers in members of the family
Cucurbitaceae and Nyctaginaceae

{{< box title="Do You Know" type="dyn" >}}

Palynology is the study of pollen
grains.It helps to identify the
distribution of coal and to locate
oil fields. Pollen grains reflect
the vegetation of an area.
Liquid nitrogen (-1960C) is used to
preserve pollen in viable condition for
prolonged duration. This technique is called
cryopreservation and is used to store pollen
grains (pollen banks) of economically
important crops for breeding programmes..

{{< /box >}}

{{< box title="Do You Know" type="dyn" >}}

Beepollen is a natural substance and contains high protein,carbohydrate,trace amount of minerals and vitamins. Thefore,it is used as dietary supplement and it sold as pollen tablets and syrups. Futher ,it increases the performance of athletes,race horses and also heals the wounds caused by burns . The study of honey pollen is called mellitopalynology.

{{< /box >}}


Pollenkitt is contributed by the tapetum
and coloured yellow or orange and is chiefly
made of carotenoids or flavonoids. It is an oily
layer forming a thick viscous coating over pollen
surface. It attracts insects and protects damage
from UV radiation.


#### Development of Male gametophyte:


The microspore is the first cell of the male
gametophyte and is haploid. The development
of male gametophyte takes place while they are
still in the microsporangium. The nucleus of the
microspore divides mitotically to form a **vegetative**
and a **generative** nucleus. A wall is laid around the
generative nucleus resulting in the formation of two
unequal cells, a large irregular nucleus bearing with
abundant food reserve called vegetative cell and a
small generative cell. Generally at this 2 celled stage,
the pollens are liberated from the anther. In some
plants the generative cell again undergoes a division
to form two male gametes. The pollen is liberated at
2 celled stage. In 60% of the angiosperms pollen is
liberated in 2 celled stage. Further, the growth of the
male gametophyte occurs only if the pollen reaches
the right stigma. The pollen on reaching the stigma
absorbs moisture and swells.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/images/1.9.png )


The intine grows as pollen tube through the germ
pore. In case the pollen is liberated at 2 celled stage the
generative cell divides in the pollen into 2 male cells
(sperms) after reaching the stigma or in the pollen
tube before reaching the embryo sac. The stages
in the development of male gametophyte is given
in Figure 1.6.


#### 1.4.2 Female reproductive part - Gynoecium

The **gynoecium** represents the female
reproductive part of the flower. The word
gynoecium represents one or more pistils of a
flower. The word pistil refers to the ovary, style
and stigma. A pistil is derived from a carpel. The
word ovary represents the part that contains the
ovules. The stigma serves as a landing platform
for pollen grains. The style is an elongated slender
part beneath the stigma. The basal swollen part
of the pistil is the ovary. The ovules are present
inside the ovary cavity (locule)on the placenta
.Gynoecium (carpel) arises as a small papillate
outgrowth of meristematic tissue from the
growing tip of the floral primordium. It grows
actively and soon gets differentiated into ovary,
style and stigma. The ovules or megasporangia
arise from the placenta. The number of ovules in
an ovary may be one (paddy, wheat and mango)
or many (papaya, water melon and orchids).


 <u> Structure of ovule(Megasporangium): 


Ovule is also called megasporangium and is
protected by one or two covering called
**integuments**. A mature ovule consists of a stalk
and a body. The stalk or the **funiculus** (also called
funicle) is present at the base and it attaches the
ovule to the placenta. The point of attachment of
funicle to the body of the ovule is known as
**hilum**. It represents the junction between ovule
and funicle. In an inverted ovule, the funicle is
adnate to the body of the ovule forming a ridge
called **raphe**. The body of the ovule is made up of
a central mass of parenchymatous tissue called
**nucellus** which has large reserve food materials.
The nucellus is enveloped by one or two protective
coverings called **integuments**. Integument
encloses the nucellus completely except at the top
where it is free and forms a pore called micropyle.
The ovule with one or two integuments are said
to be **unitegmic** or **bitegmic** ovules respectively.
The basal region of the body of the ovule where
the nucellus, the integument and the funicle meet
or merge is called as **chalaza**. There is a large,
oval, sac-like structure in the nucellus toward
the micropylar end called **embryo** **sac** or female
gametophyte. It develops from the functional
megaspore formed within the nucellus. In some
species(unitegmic tenuinucellate) the inner
layer of the integument may become specialized
to perform the nutritive function for the embryo
sac and is called as **endothelium**
or **integumentary** **tapetum** (Example :
Asteraceae). There are two types of ovule based
on the position of the sporogenous cell. If the
sporogenous cell is hypodermal with a single
layer of nucellar tissue around it is called
**tenuinucellate** type. Normally tenuinucellate
ovules have very small nucellus. Ovules with
subhypodermal sporogenous cell is called
**crassinucellate** type. Normally these ovules
have fairly large nucellus. Group of cells found
at the base of the ovule between the chalaza and
embryo sac is called **hypostase** and the thick
-walled cells found above the micropylar end
above the embryo sac is called **epistase**. The
structure of ovule is given in Figure 1.7.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/images/1.10.png )



#### Types of Ovules


The ovules are classified into six main types
based on the orientation, form and position
of the micropyle with respect to funicle and
chalaza. Most important ovule types are
orthotropous, anatropous, hemianatropous and
campylotropous. The types of ovule is given in
Figure 1.8.


**Orthotropous**: In this type of ovule, the
micropyle is at the distal end and the micropyle,
the funicle and the chalaza lie in one straight
vertical line. Examples: Piperaceae, Polygonaceae.


**Anatropous**: The body of the ovule becomes
completely inverted so that the micropyle
and funiculus come to lie very close to each
other. This is the common type of ovules
found in dicots and monocots.


**Hemianatropous**: In this, the body of the
ovule is placed transversely and at right angles
to the funicle. Example: Primulaceae.


**Campylotropous**: The body of the ovule at the
micropylar end is curved and more or less bean
shaped. The embryo sac is slightly curved. All the
three, hilum, micropyle and chalaza are adjacent
to one another, with the micropyle oriented
towards the placenta. Example: Leguminosae
In addition to the above main types there are
two more types of ovules they are,



**Amphitropous**: The distance between hilum
and chalaza is less. The curvature of the ovule
leads to horse-shoe shaped nucellus. Example:
some Alismataceae.

**Circinotropous**: Funiculus is very long and
surrounds the ovule. Example: Cactaceae


##### Megasporogenesis


The process of development of a megaspore
from a megaspore mother cell is called
**megasporogenesis**.



As the ovule develops, a single hypodermal
cell in the nucellus becomes enlarged and
functions as **archesporium**. In some plants,
the archesporial cell may directly function as
megaspore mother cell. In others, it may undergo
a transverse division to form outer primary
parietal cell and inner primary sporogenous
cell. The parietal cell may remain undivided or
divide by few periclinal and anticlinal divisions
to embed the primary sporogenous cell deep
into the nucellus. The primary sporogenous
cell functions as a megaspore mother cell. The
megaspore mother cell (MMO) undergoes
meiotic division to form four haploid megaspores.
Based on the number of megaspores that develop
into the Embryo sac, we have three basic types
of development: **monosporic**, **bisporic** and
**tetrasporic**. The megaspores are usually arranged
in a linear tetrad. Of the four megaspores formed,
usually the chalazal one is functional and other
three megaspores degenerate. The functional
megaspore forms the female gametophyte
or embryo sac. This type of development is
called **monosporic** development (Example:
Polygonum). Of the four megaspores formed
if two are involved in Embryo sac formation
the development is called **bisporic** (Example:
Allium). If all the four megaspores are involved
in Embryo sac formation the development
is called **tetrasporic** (Example: Peperomia).
An ovule generally has a single embryo sac.
The development of monosporic embryo sac
(Polygonum type) is given in Figure 1.9.


##### Development of Monosporic embryo sac.

To describe the stages in embryo sac development
and organization the simplest monosporic type
of development is given below.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/images/1.11.png )

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/images/1.14.png )


The functional megaspore is the first cell of
the embryo sac or female gametophyte. The
megaspore elongates along micropylar- chalazal axis.
 The nucleus undergoes a mitotic division . Wall formation does not follow the nuclear division. A large central vacuole now appears between the two daughter nuclei. The vacuole expands and pushes the nuclei towards the opposite poles of
the embryo sac. Both the nuclei divide twice
mitotically, forming four nuclei at each pole. At
this stage all the eight nuclei are present in a
common cytoplasm (free nuclear division).
After the last nuclear division the cell undergoes
appreciable elongation, assuming a sac-like
appearance. This is followed by cellular
organization of the embryo sac. Of the four
nuclei at the micropylar end of the embryo sac,
three organize into an **egg** **apparatus**, the fourth
one is left free in the cytoplasm of the central
cell as the upper polar nucleus. Three nuclei of
the chalazal end form three **antipodal** **cells**
whereas the fourth one functions as the lower
polar nucleus. Depending on the plant the **2**
**polar** **nuclei** may remain free or may fuse to
form a **secondary** **nucleus** (central cell). The
egg apparatus is made up of a central egg cell
and two synergids, one on each side of the egg
cell. Synergids secrete chemotropic substances
that help to attract the pollen tube. The special
cellular thickening called filiform apparatus of
synergids help in the absorption, conduction of
nutrients from the nucellus to embryo sac. It
also guides the pollen tube into the egg. Thus, a
7 celled with 8 nuclei embryo sac is formed. The
structure of embryo sac is given in Figure 1.10.

#### Pollination


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/images/1.13.png )

Pollination is a wonderful mechanism which
provides food,
shelter etc., for
the pollinating
animals. Many
plants
are
pollinated
by
a
particular
animal species
and the flowers are modified accordingly and
thus there exists a co-evolution between plants
and animals. Let us imagine if pollination fails.
Do you think there will be any seed and fruit
formation? If not what happens to pollinating
organisms and those that depend on these
pollinating organism for the food? Here lies the
significance of the process of pollination.



The pollen grains produced in the anther
will germinate only when they reach the stigma
of the pistil. The reproductive organs, stamens
and pistil of the flower are spatially separated, a
mechanism which is essential for pollen grains
to reach the stigma is needed. This process of
transfer of pollen grains from the anther to a
stigma of a flower is called **pollination**.




**Pollination** is a characteristic feature
spermatophyte
(Gymnosperms
and Angiosperms). Pollination in gymnosperms
is said to be direct as the pollens are deposited
directly on the exposed ovules, whereas in
angiosperms it is said to be indirect, as the
pollens are deposited on the stigma of the
pistil. In majority of angiosperms, the flower
opens and exposes its mature anthers and
stigma for pollination. Such flowers are called
**chasmogamous** and the phenomenon is
**chasmogamy**. In other plants, pollination occurs
without opening and exposing their sex organs.
Such flowers are called **cleistogamous** and the
phenomenon is **cleistogamy**.
Based upon the flower on which the pollen of a
flower reaches, the pollination is classified into
two kinds, namely, **self**-**pollination** (**Autogamy**)
and **cross**-**pollination**(**Allogamy**).


##### A. Self-pollination or Autogamy 
(Greek
Auto = self, gamos = marriage):



According to a majority of Botanists, the
transfer of pollen on the stigma of the same
flower is called **self-pollination or** **Autogamy**.
Self-pollination is possible only in those plants
which bear bisexual flowers. In order to promote
self- pollination the flowers of the plants have
several adaptations or mechanisms. They are:



1. **Cleistogamy**: In cleistogamy (Greek Kleisto
= closed. Gamos = marriage) flowers never open
and expose the reproductive organs and thus the
pollination is carried out within the closed flower.
Commelina, Viola, Oxalis are some examples
for cleistogamous flowers. In Commelina
benghalensis, two types of flowers are produced-
aerial and underground flowers. The aerial
flowers are brightly coloured, chasmogamous
and insect pollinated. The underground flowers
are borne on the subterranean branches of the
rhizome that are dull, cleistogamous and self
pollinated and are not dependent on pollinators
for pollination.(Figure 1.11).



2. **Homogamy**: When the stamens and
stigma of a flower mature at the same time
it is said to be homogamy. It favours self
pollination to occur. Example: *Mirabilis jalapa*,
*Catharanthus roseus*

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/images/1.15.png )


3. **Incomplete dichogamy**: In dichogamous
flowers the stamen and stigma of a flower mature at
different time. Sometimes , the time of maturation
of these essential organs overlap so that it becomes
favourable for self-pollination.



##### B. Cross - pollination



It refers to the transfer of pollens on the stigma
of another flower. The cross-pollination is of two
types:




**i. Geitonogamy**: When the pollen deposits on
another flower of the same individual plant, it
is said to be geitonogamy. It usually occurs in
plants which show monoecious condition. It is
functionally cross-pollination but is generally
similar to autogamy because the pollen comes
from same plant.




**ii. Xenogamy**: When the pollen (genetically
different) deposits on another flower of a different
plant of the same species , it is called as xenogamy.
**Contrivances of cross-pollination**



The flowers have several mechanisms that
promote cross-pollination which are also called
**contrivances of cross-pollination or outbreeding**
devices. It includes the following.


1. **Dicliny or Unisexuality**



When the flowers are unisexual only cross-
pollination is possible. There are two types.



i. **Monoecious**: Male and female flowers on
the same plant. Coconut, Bitter gourd. In plants
like castor and maize, autogamy is prevented but
geitonogamy takes place.



ii. **Dioecious** : Male and female flowers on different
plants. Borassus, Carica and phoenix. Here both
autogamy and geitonogamy are prevented.




2. **Monocliny or Bisexuality**



Flowers are bisexual and the special adaptation of
the flowers prevents self-pollination.




i. **Dichogamy**: In bisexual flowers anthers and
stigmas mature at different times, thus checking
self-pollination. It is of two types.




a. **Protandry**: The stamens mature earlier than
the stigmas of the flowers. Examples: Helianthus,
Clerodendrum (Figure 1.12 a).




b. **Protogyny**: The stigmas mature earlier than
the stamens of the flower. Examples: Scrophularia
nodosa and Aristolochia bracteata (Figure1.12b)



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/images/1.17.png )





**ii. Herkogamy**: In bisexual flowers the
essential organs, the stamens and stigmas, are
arranged in such a way that self-pollination 
becomes impossible. For example in Gloriosa
superba, the style is reflexed away from the
stamens and in Hibiscus the stigmas project far above the stamens (Figure 1.13).


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/images/1.16.png )




**iii. Heterostyly:** Some plants produce two
or three different forms of flowers that are
different in their length of stamens and style.
Pollination will take place only between organs
of the same length.(Figure 1.14)




**a. Distyly**: The plant produces two forms
of flowers, Pin or long style, long stigmatic
papillae, short stamens and small pollen grains;
Thrum-eyed or short style, small stigmatic
papillae, long stamens and large pollen grains.
Example: *Primula* (Figure 1.14a). The stigma of
the Thrum-eyed flowers and the anther of the
pin lie in same level to bring out pollination.
Similarly the anther of Thrum-eyed and stigma
of pin ones is found in same height. This helps
in effective pollination.



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/images/1.18.png )




**b. Tristyly**: The plant produces three kinds of
flowers, with respect to the length of the style
and stamens. Here,the pollen from flowers of
one type can pollinate only the other two types
but not their own type. Example : *Lythrum*
(Figure 1.14b).


**iv. Self sterility/ Self- incompatibility**: In
some plants, when the pollen grain of a flower
reaches the stigma of the same, it is unable to
germinate or prevented to germinate on its
own stigma. Examples: *Abutilon, Passiflora.* It
is a genetic mechanism.






##### Agents of pollination




Pollination is effected by many agents like
wind, water, insects etc. On the basis of the
agents that bring about pollination, the mode
of pollination is divided into abiotic and biotic.
The latter type is used by majority of plants.




**Abiotic agents**



1. Anemophily - pollination by Wind



2. Hydrophily - pollination by Water




**Biotic agents**



1. Zoophily



Zoophily refers to pollination through animals
and pollination through insects is called
Entomophily.







1. **Anemophily**: Pollination by wind. The wind
pollinated flowers are called **anemophilous**.
The wind pollinated plants are generally
situated in wind exposed regions. Anemophily
is a chance event. Therefore, the pollen may
not reach the target flower effectively and are
wasted during the transit from one flower
to another. The common examples of wind
pollinated flowers are - grasses, sugarcane,
bamboo, coconut, palm, maize etc.,




**Anemophilous plants have the following**
**characteristic features:**




• The flowers are produced in pendulous,
catkin-like or spike inflorescence.





• The axis of inflorescence elongates so that the flowers are brought well above the leaves.


• The perianth is absent or highly reduced.


• The flowers are small, inconspicuous,
colourless, not scented, do not secrete nectar.



• The stamens are numerous, filaments are
long, exerted and versatile.



• Anthers produce enormous quantities of
pollen grains compared to number of ovules
available for pollination. They are minute,
light and dry so that they can be carried to
long distances by wind.



• In some plants anthers burst violently and
release the pollen into the air. Example:
Urtica.



• Stigmas are comparatively large, protruding,
sometimes branched and feathery, adapted
to catch the pollen grains. Generally single
ovule is present.



• Plant produces flowers before the new leaves
appear, so the pollen can be carried without
hindrance of leaves.



**Pollination in Maize (Zea mays)**: The maize
is monoecious and unisexual. The male
inflorescence (tassel) is borne terminally and
female inflorescence (cob) laterally at lower
levels. Maize pollens are large and heavy and
cannot be carried by light breeze. However,
the mild wind shakes the male inflorescence to
release the pollen which falls vertically below.
The female inflorescence has long stigma (silk)
measuring upto 23 cm in length, which projects
beyond leaves. The pollens drop from the tassel
is caught by the stigma (Figure 1.15).


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/images/1.19.png )



**2. Hydrophily**: Pollination by water is called
hydrophily and the flowers pollinated by water are
said to be **hydrophilous** (Example: Vallisneria,
Hydrilla). Though there are a number of aquatic
plants, only in few plants pollination takes place
by water. The floral envelop of hydrophilous
plants are reduced or absent. In water plants
like Eichhornia and water lilly pollination takes
place through wind or by insects. There are
two types of hydrophily, Epihydrophily and
Hypohydrophily. In most of the hydrophilous
flowers, the pollen grains possesses mucilage
covering which protects them from wetting.



**a. Epihydrophily**: Pollination occurs at the
water level. Examples: *Vallisneria spiralis*,
*Elodea*.




**Pollination in *Vallisneria spiralis***: It is a
dioecious, submerged and rooted hydrophyte.
The female plant bears solitary flowers which rise
to the surface of water level using a long coiled
stalk at the time of pollination. A small cup
shaped depression is formed around the female
flower on the surface of the water. The male plant
produces male flowers which get detached and
float on the surface of the water. As soon as a
male flowers comes in contact with the female
flower and pollination takes place, Stalk of the
female flower coils and goes under water where
fruits are produced. (Figure 1.16).


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/images/1.20.png )


**b. Hypohydrophily**:
Pollination
occurs
inside the water. Examples: *Zostera marina* and
*Ceratophyllum*.

Visit to a nearby park and observe the
different flowers. Record the adaptations
or modifications found in the flowers for
different types of pollination.

**3. Zoophily**: Pollination by the agency of animals
is called zoophily and flowers are said to be
zoophilous. Animals that bring about pollination
may be birds, bats, snails and insects. Of these,
insects are well adapted to bring pollination.
Larger animals like primates (lemurs), arboreal
rodents, reptiles (gecko lizard and garden lizard)
have also been reported as pollinators.



**A. Ornithophily:** Pollination by birds is called
Ornithophily. Some common plants that are
pollinated by birds are *Erythrina, Bombax*,
*Syzygium*, *Bignonia*, *Sterlitzia* etc., Humming
birds, sun birds, and honey eaters are some
of the birds which regularly visit flowers and
bring about pollination.




**The ornithophilous flowers have**
**following characteristic features**:


•  The flowers are usually large in size.


•  The flowes are tubular, cup shaped or urn-
shaped.



•  The flowers are brightly coloured, red,
scarlet, pink, orange, blue and yellow which
attracts the birds


•  The flowers are scentless and produce nectar
in large quantities. Pollen and nectar form
the floral rewards for the birds visiting the flower.



•  The floral parts are tough and leathery to
withstand the powerful impact of the visitors.




**B. Cheiropterophily**: Pollination carried out
by bats is called cheiropterophily. Some of the
common cheiropterophilous plants are *Kigelia*
*africana*, *Adansonia digitata*, etc.,




**C. Malacophily**: Pollination by slugs and
snails is called malacophily. Some plants of
Araceae are pollinated by snails. Water snails
crawling among *Lemna* pollinate them.

**D. Entomophily**: Pollination by insects is
called **Entomophily**. Pollination by ant is called
**myrmecophily**. Insects that are well adapted to bring pollination are bees, moths, butterflies
flies, wasps and beetles. Of the insects, beesare the main flower visitors and dominant
pollinators. Insects are chief pollinating agents
and majority of angiosperms are adapted
for insect pollination. It is the most common type  of pollination.







**The characteristic features of entomo­philous flowers are as follows:**


• Flowers are generally large or if small they are aggregated in dense inflorescence.Example: Asteraceae flowers.


• Flowers are brightly coloured.The adjacent part of the flowers may also be brightly coloured to attract insect. For example in *Poinsettia* and *Bougainvillea* the *bracts* become coloured.

• Flowers are scented and produce nectar.

• Flowers in which there is no secretion of nectar, the pollen is either consumed as
nectar, the pollen is either consumed as food or used in building up of its hive by the
honeybees. Pollen and nectar are the floral rewards for the visitors.


• Flowers pollinated by flies and beetles produce foul odour to attract pollinators.


• In some flowers juicy cells are present which are pierced and the contents are sucked by
the insects.



**Pollination in Salvia (Lever mechanism):**


The flower is protandrous and the corolla is
NT
bilabiate with 2 stamens. A lever mechanis
helps in pollination. Each anther has an upper
fertile lobe and lower sterile lobe which is
separated by a long connective which helps
the anthers to swing freely. When a bee visits
a flower,
it sits on the lower lip which acts as a
platform. It enters the flower to suck the nectar
by pushing its head into the corolla. During the
entry of the bee into the flower the body
strikes against the sterile end of the connective.
This makes the fertile part of the stamen to
descend and strike at the back of the bee.
The pollen gets deposited on the back of the
bee. When it visits another flower, the pollen
gets rubbed against the stigma and completes
the act of pollination in *Salvia* (Figure 1.17).
Some of the other interesting pollination
mechanisms found in plants are a) Trap
mechanism (*Aristolochia*);Pit fall mechanism
(*Arum*);Clip
or
translator
mechanism (*Asclepiadaceae*) and piston mechanism (*Papilionaceae*).
