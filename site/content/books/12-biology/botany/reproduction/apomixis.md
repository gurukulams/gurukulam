Reproduction involving fertilization in
flowering plants is called amphimixis and
wherever reproduction does not involve union
of male and female gametes is called apomixis.


The term Apomixis was introduced by
Winkler in the year 1908. It is defined as
the substitution of the usual sexual system
(Amphimixis) by a form of reproduction which
does not involve meiosis and syngamy.



Maheswari (1950) classified Apomixis into
two types - Recurrent and Non recurrent


**Recurrent apomixis**: It includes vegetative
reproduction and agamospermy


**Non recurrent apomixis**: Haploid embryo
sac developed after meiosis, develops into a
embryo without fertilization.


The outline classification of Recurrent
apomixis is given below.

**Vegetative reproduction**: Plants propagate by
any part other than seeds


Bulbils – *Fritillaria imperialis*; Bulbs –
*Allium*; Runner – *Mentha arvensis*; Sucker -
*Chrysanthemum*

**Agamospermy**: It refers to processes by which
Embryos are formed by eliminating meiosis and
syngamy.


**Adventive embryony**


An Embryo arises directly from the diploid
sporophytic cells either from nucellus or
integument. It is also called **sporophytic**
**budding** because gametophytic phase is
completely absent. Adventive embryos are found
in *Citrus* and *Mangifera*


**Diplospory (Generative apospory)**: A diploid
embryo sac is formed from megaspore mother
cell without a regular meiotic division Examples.
*Eupatorium* and *Aerva*.


**Apospory**: Megaspore mother cell (MMC)
undergoes the normal meiosis and four
megaspores formed gradually disappear. A
nucellar cell becomes activated and develops into
a diploid embryo sac. This type of apospory is also
called somatic apospory. Examples *Hieracium*
and *Parthenium*.
