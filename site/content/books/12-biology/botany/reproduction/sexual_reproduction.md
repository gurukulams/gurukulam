In previous classes reproduction in lower plants
like algae and bryophytes was discussed in detail.
Sexual reproduction involves the production
and fusion of male and female gametes. The
former is called gametogenesis and the latter 
is the process of fertilization. Let us recall the
sexual reproduction in algae and bryophytes.
They reproduce by the production of gametes
which may be motile or non motile depending
upon the species. The gametic fusion is of three
types (Isogamy, Anisogamy and Oogamy). In
algae external fertilization takes place whereas
in higher plants internal fertilization occurs.


#### Flower
A flower is viewed in multidimensional
perspectives from time immemorial. It is an
inspirational tool for the poets. It is a decorative
material for all the celebrations. In Tamil
literature the five lands are denoted by different
flowers. The flags of some countries are
embedded with flowers. Flowers are used in the
preparation of perfumes. For a Morphologist,
a flower is a highly condensed shoot meant for
reproduction. As you have already learned about
the parts of a flower in Unit II of Class XI, let us
recall the parts of a flower. A Flower possesses
four whorls- Calyx, Corolla, Androecium and
Gynoecium. Androecium and Gynoecium
are essential organs(Figure 1.3). The process
or changes involved in sexual reproduction of
higher plants include three stages .They are Prefertilization, Fertilization and Post fertilization
changes. Let us discuss these events in detail.
