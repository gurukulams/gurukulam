As mentioned earlier, the ovary becomes the
fruit and the ovule becomes the seed after
fertilization. However in a number of cases,
fruit like structures may develop from the
ovary without the act of fertilization. Such
fruits are called parthenocarpic fruits.
Invariably they will not have true seeds.
Many commercial fruits are made seedless.
Examples: Banana, Grapes and Papaya.


#### Significance


• The seedless fruits have great significance
in horticulture.

• The seedless fruits have great commercial
importance.


• Seedless fruits are useful for the preparation
of jams, jellies, sauces, fruit drinks etc.


• High proportion of edible part is available
in parthenocarpic fruits due to the absence
of seeds.


#### Summary


Reproduction is one of the attributes of
living things. Lower plants, microbes and
animals reproduce by different methods
(fragmentation, gemma, binary fission,
budding, regeneration). Organisms reproduce
through asexual and sexual methods. Asexual
methods in angiosperms occur through natural
or artificial methods. The natural methods
take place through vegetative propagules or
diaspores. Artificial method of reproduction
involves cutting, layering and grafting.
Micropropagation is a modern method used
to raise new plants.



Sexual
reproduction
includes
gametogenesis and fertilization. External
fertilization occurs in lower plants like algae
but in higher plants internal fertilization
takes place. A flower is a modified shoot
meant for reproduction. Stamen is the male
reproductive part and produces pollen grains.
The development of microspore is called
microsporogenesis. The microspore mother
cell undergoes meiotic division to produce
four haploid microspores. In majority of
Angiosperms the anther is dithecous and
are tetrasporangiate. It possesses epidermis,
endothecium, middle layers and tapetum.
The hygroscopic nature of endothecial cell
along with thin walled stomium helps in the
dehiscence of anther. Tapetum nourishes the
microspores and also contributes to the wall
materials of the pollen grain. Pollen grain is
derived from the microspore and possesses
thin inner intine and thick outer exine.
Sporopollenin is present in exine and is resistant
to physiological and biological decomposition.
Microspore is the first cell of male gametophyte.
The nucleus of the microspore divides to form
a vegetative nucleus and a generative nucleus.
The generative nucleus divides to form
two male nuclei. Gynoecium is the female
reproductive part of a flower and it represents
one or more pistils. The ovary bears ovules
which are attached to the placenta. There are
six major types of ovules. The development
of megaspore from megaspore mother cell
is called megasporogenesis. A monosporic
embryo sac (Polygonum type) possesses three
antipodals in chalazal end, Three cells in the
micropylar end constituting egg apparatus(1
gg and 2 Synergids) and two polar nucleus
fused to form secondary nucleus. Thus, a
7 celled 8 nucleated Embryo sac is present.
The transfer of pollen grains to the
stigma of a flower is called pollination. Self-
pollination and cross-pollination are two
types of pollination. Double fertilization
and triple fusion are characteristic features
of angiosperms. After fertilization the ovary
transforms into a fruit and the ovule becomes
a seed. Endosperm is triploid in angiosperms
and is of three types – Nuclear, cellular, helobial.
Reproduction which doesn’t involve meiosis
and syngamy is called apomixis. Occurrence
of more than one embryo in a seed is called
polyembryony. Formation of fruit without the
act of fertilization is called parthenocarpy.
