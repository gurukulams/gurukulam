One of the essential features of all living things
on the earth is reproduction. Reproduction is a
vital process for the existence of a species and it
also brings suitable changes through variation in
the offsprings for their survival on earth. Plant
reproduction is important not only for its own
survival but also for the continuation and existence
of all other organisms since the latter directly or
indirectly depend on plants. Reproduction also
plays an important role in evolution.


In this unit let us learn in detail about
reproduction in plants.


Basically reproduction occurring in
organisms fall under **two major** categories


1. Asexual reproduction
2. Sexual reproduction



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/1.png )










#### 1.5 Fertilization

The fusion of male and female
gamete is called **fertilization**.
**Double fertilization** is seen in
angiosperms.



**Events of fertilization**



The stages involved in double
fertilization are:- germination
of pollen to form pollen tube
in the stigma; growth of pollen
tube in the style; direction
of pollen tube towards the micropyle of the
ovule; entry of the pollen tube into one of the
synergids of the embryo sac, discharge of
male gametes; syngamy and triple fusion. The
events from pollen deposition on the stigma to
the entry of pollen tube in to the ovule is called
**pollen- pistil interaction**. It is a dynamic
process which involves recognition of pollen
and to promote or inhibit its germination and
growth.



##### Pollen on the stigma



In nature, a variety of pollens fall on the receptive
stigma, but all of them do not germinate and
bring out fertilization. The receptive surface
of the stigma receives the pollen. If the pollen
is compatible with the stigma it germinates to
form a tube. This is facilitated by the stigmatic
fluid in **wet stigma** and pellicle in **dry stigma**.
These two also decide the incompatibility and compatibility of the pollen through **recognition**-
**rejection protein reaction** between the pollen
and stigma surface. Sexual incompatibility may
exist between different species (interspecific)
or between members of the same species
(intraspecific).The latter is called self-
incompatibility. The first visible change in the
pollen, soon after it lands on stigma is hydration.
The pollen wall proteins are released from the
surface. During the germination of pollen its
entire content moves into the pollen tube. The
growth is restricted to the tip of the tube and
all the cytoplasmic contents move to the tip
region. The remaining part of the pollen tube
is occupied by a vacuole which is cut off from
the tip by callose plug. The extreme tip of pollen
tube appears hemispherical and transparent
when viewed through the microscope. This
is called **cap block**. As soon as the cap block
disappear the growth of the pollen tube stops.



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/28.png )


##### Pollen tube in the style


After the germination the pollen tube enters into
the style from the stigma. The growth of the pollen
tube in the style depends on the type of style.



**Types of style**



There are three types of style a) Hollow or
open style b)solid style or closed style c) semi-
solid or half closed style.






**Hollow style (Open style)**: It is common
among monocots. A hollow canal running from
the stigma to the base of the style is present.
The canal is lined by a single layer of glandular
canal cells (Transmitting tissue).They secrete
mucilaginous substances. The pollen tube grows
on the surface of the cells lining the stylar canal.
The canal is filled with secretions which serve
as nutrition for growing pollen tubes and also
controlling incompatibility reaction between
the style and pollen tube. The secretions contain
carbohydrates, lipids and some enzymes
like esterases, acid phosphatases as well as
compatibility controlling proteins.


**Solid style (Closed type)**: It is common among
dicots. It is characterized by the presence of
central core of elongated, highly specialised
cells called transmitting tissue.This is equivalent
to the lining cells of hollow style and does the
same function. Its contents are also similar
to the content of those cells. The pollen tube
grows through the intercellular spaces of the
transmitting tissue.





**Semi-solid style (half closed type)**: This is
intermediate between solid and open type.





There is a difference of opinion on the
nature of transmitting tissue. Some authors
consider that it is found only in solid styles
while others consider the lining cells of hollow
style also has transmitting tissue.






**Entry of pollen tube into the ovule**: There
are three types of pollen tube entry into the
ovule(Figure 1.18).



**Porogamy**: when the pollen tube enters
through the micropyle.




![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/29.png )


**Chalazogamy**: when the pollen tube enters
through the chalaza.


**Mesogamy**: when the pollen tube enters
through the integument.




##### Entry of pollen tube into embryo sac:
Irrespective of the place of entry of pollen
tube into ovule, it enters the embryo sac at the
micropylar end. The pollen enters into embryo
sac directly into one of the synergids.



The growth of pollen tube towards the ovary,
ovule and embryo sac is due to the presence of
chemotropic substances. The pollen tube after
travelling the whole length of the style enters
into the ovary locule where it is guided towards
the micropyle of the ovule by a structure called
obturator (See Do you know). After reaching the
embryo sac, a pore is formed in pollen tube wall at
its apex or just behind the apex. The content of the
pollen tube (two male gametes, vegetative nucleus
and cytoplasm) are discharged into the synergids
into which pollen tube enters. The pollen tube
does not grow beyond it, in the embryo sac. The
tube nucleus disorganizes.



##### 1.5.1 Double fertilization and triple fusion


S.G. Nawaschin and L.Guignard in 1898 and
1899, observed in *Lilium* and *Fritillaria* that
both the male gametes released from a male
gametophyte are involved in the fertilization.
They fertilize two different components of
the embryo sac. Since both the male gametes
are involved in fertilization, the phenomenon
is called **double** **fertilization** and is unique
to angiosperms. One of the male gametes
fuses with the egg nucleus (syngamy) to form
Zygote. (Figure 1.19)




![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/30.png )


The second gamete migrates to the central cell
where it fuses with the **polar** **nuclei** or their



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/31.png )



fusion product, the secondary nucleus and
forms the **primary endosperm nucleus (PEN).**
Since this involves the fusion of three nuclei,
this phenomenon is called **triple fusion**. This
act results in endosperm formation which
forms the nutritive tissue for the embryo.


##### 1.6 Post Fertilization structure and events


After fertilization, several changes take place in
the floral parts up to the formation of the seed
(Figure 1.20).


The events after fertilization (endosperm,
embryo development, formation of seed, fruits)
are called fertilization changes.



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/32.png )



##### Endosperm


The primary endosperm nucleus (PEN)
divides immediately after fertilization but
before the zygote starts to divide, to form
the endosperm. The primary endosperm
nucleus is the result of triple fusion (two
polar nuclei and one sperm nucleus) and
thus has 3n number of chromosomes. It is
a nutritive tissue and regulatory structure
that nourishes the developing embryo.



Depending upon the mode of development
three types of endosperm are recognized in
angiosperms. They are nuclear endosperm,
cellular endosperm and helobial endosperm
(Figure 1.21).


**Nuclear endosperm**: Primary Endosperm
Nucleus undergoes several mitotic divisions
without cell wall formation thus a free nuclear
condition exists in the endosperm. Examples:
*Coccinia*, *Capsella* and *Arachis*



**Cellular endosperm**: Primary endosperm
nucleus divides into 2 nuclei and it is
immediately followed by wall formation.
Subsequent divisions also follow cell wall
formation. Examples: *Adoxa*, *Helianthus* and
*Scoparia*


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/33.png )



**Helobial endosperm**: Primary Endosperm
Nucleus moves towards base of embryo sac and
divides into two nuclei. Cell wall formation
takes place leading to the formation of a large
micropylar and small chalazal chamber. The
nucleus of the micropylar chamber undergoes
several free nuclear division whereas that
of chalazal chamber may or may not divide.
Examples : *Hydrilla* and *Vallisneria*.


The endosperms may either be completely
consumed by the developing embryo or it may
persist in the mature seeds. Those seeds without
endosperms are called non- endospermous or
ex- albuminous seeds. Examples: Pea, Groundnut and Beans. Those seeds with endosperms are
called endospermous or albuminous seeds. The
endosperms in these seeds supply nutrition to
the embryo during seed germination. Examples:
Paddy, Coconut and Castor.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/34.png )


**Ruminate endosperm**: The endosperm with
irregularity and unevenness in its surface forms
ruminate endosperm. Examples :*Areca catechu,*
*Passiflora* and *Myristica*


**Functions of endosperm:**


•	It is the nutritive tissue for the developing
embryo.


•  In majority of angiosperms, the zygote
divides only after the development of
endosperm.


•	Endosperm regulates the precise mode of embryo development.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/35.png )





**Development of Dicot embryo**


The Stages involved in the development
of Dicot embryo (*Capsella bursa-pastoris* –
Onagrad or crucifer type) is given in Figure
1.22. The embryo develops at micropylar
end of embryo sac. The zygote undergoes
transverse division to form upper or terminal
cell and lower or basal cell. Further divisions
in the zygote during the development lead to
the formation of embryo. Embryo undergoes
globular, heart shaped stages before reaching a
mature stage. The mature embryo has a **radicle**,
two **cotyledons** and a **plumule**.




![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/46.png )


##### Seed

The fertilized ovule is called seed and possesses
an embryo, endosperm and a protective coat.
Seeds may be endospermous (wheat, maize,
barley and sunflower) or non endospermo.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/36.png )


**Cicer seed (example for Dicot seed)**
The mature seeds are attached to the fruit
wall by a stalk called **funiculus**. The funiculus
disappears leaving a scar called **hilum**. Below
the hilum a small pore called **micropyle** is
present. It facilitates entry of oxygen and
water into the seeds during germination.
Each seed has a thick outer covering called
seed coat. The seed coat is developed from
integuments of the ovule. The outer coat is
called **testa** and is hard whereas the inner coat
is thin, membranous and is called **tegmen**.
In Pea plant the tegmen and testa are fused.
Two cotyledons laterally attached to the
embryonic axis and store the food materials
in pea whereas in other seeds like castor the




![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/37.png )



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/38.png )



**Figure 1.23(a)**
Dicot
- *Cicer arientinum*
endosperm contains reserve food and the
cotyledons are thin. The portion of embryonal
Fruit (Caryopsis) entire
axis projecting beyond the cotyledons is
called **radicle** or embryonic root. The other
end of the axis called embryonic shoot is
the **plumule**. Embryonal axis above the
Endosperm
level of cotyledon is called **epicotyl** whereas
Scutellum the level of
the cylindrical region between
Coleoptile
cotyledon is called **hypocotyl**(Figure
1.23 a).



**Oryza seed (example for Monocot seed)**

The seed of paddy is one seeded and is called
**Caryopsis**. Each seed remains enclosed by
a brownish husk which consists of glumes
arranged in two rows. The seed coat is a
brownish, membranous layer closely adhered to
the grain. Endosperm forms the bulk of the grain
and is the storage tissue. It is separated from
embryo by a definite layer called **epithelium**.
The embryo is small and consists of one shield-
shaped cotyledon known as **scutellum** present
towards lateral side of embryonal axis.



A short axis with plumule and radicle protected
by the **root** **cap** is present. The plumule is
surrounded by a protective sheath called
**coleoptile**. The radicle including root cap
is also covered by a protective sheath called
**coleorhiza**. The scutellum supplies the growing
embryo with food material absorbed from the
endosperm with the help of the epithelium
(Figure 1.23 b).



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/39.png )


#### 1.7 Apomixis


Reproduction involving fertilization in
flowering plants is called amphimixis and
wherever reproduction does not involve union
of male and female gametes is called apomixis.


The term Apomixis was introduced by
Winkler in the year 1908. It is defined as
the substitution of the usual sexual system
(Amphimixis) by a form of reproduction which
does not involve meiosis and syngamy.



Maheswari (1950) classified Apomixis into
two types - Recurrent and Non recurrent


**Recurrent apomixis**: It includes vegetative
reproduction and agamospermy


**Non recurrent apomixis**: Haploid embryo
sac developed after meiosis, develops into a
embryo without fertilization.


The outline classification of Recurrent
apomixis is given below.



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/40.png )




**Vegetative reproduction**: Plants propagate by
any part other than seeds


Bulbils – *Fritillaria imperialis*; Bulbs –
*Allium*; Runner – *Mentha arvensis*; Sucker -
*Chrysanthemum*

**Agamospermy**: It refers to processes by which
Embryos are formed by eliminating meiosis and
syngamy.


**Adventive embryony**


An Embryo arises directly from the diploid
sporophytic cells either from nucellus or
integument. It is also called **sporophytic**
**budding** because gametophytic phase is
completely absent. Adventive embryos are found
in *Citrus* and *Mangifera*


**Diplospory (Generative apospory)**: A diploid
embryo sac is formed from megaspore mother
cell without a regular meiotic division Examples.
*Eupatorium* and *Aerva*.


**Apospory**: Megaspore mother cell (MMC)
undergoes the normal meiosis and four
megaspores formed gradually disappear. A
nucellar cell becomes activated and develops into
a diploid embryo sac. This type of apospory is also
called somatic apospory. Examples *Hieracium*
and *Parthenium*.



#### 1.8 Polyembryony


Occurrence of more than one embryo in a
seed is called polyembryony (Figure 1.24).
The first case of polyembryony was reported
in certain oranges by Anton von Leeuwenhoek
in the year 1719. Polyembryony is divided into
four categories based on its origin.



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/41.png )





a. **Cleavage polyembryony** (Example: Orchids)


b. **Formation of embryo by cells of the **Embryo**
**sac** other than egg** (Synergids – *Aristolochia*;
antipodals – *Ulmus* and endosperm –
*Balanophora*)


c. **Development of more than one Embryo sac**
**within the same ovule.** (Derivatives of same
MMC, derivatives of two or more MMC –
*Casuarina*)


d. **Activation of some sporophytic cells of **the**
**ovule**** (Nucellus/ integuments-*Citrus* and
*Syzygium*).


**Practical applications**


The seedlings formed from the nucellar tissue
in Citrus are found better clones for Orchards.
Embryos derived through polyembryony are
found virus free.


#### 1.9 Parthenocarpy


As mentioned earlier, the ovary becomes the
fruit and the ovule becomes the seed after
fertilization. However in a number of cases,
fruit like structures may develop from the
ovary without the act of fertilization. Such
fruits are called parthenocarpic fruits.
Invariably they will not have true seeds.
Many commercial fruits are made seedless.
Examples: Banana, Grapes and Papaya.


#### Significance


• The seedless fruits have great significance
in horticulture.

• The seedless fruits have great commercial
importance.


• Seedless fruits are useful for the preparation
of jams, jellies, sauces, fruit drinks etc.


• High proportion of edible part is available
in parthenocarpic fruits due to the absence
of seeds.


#### Summary


Reproduction is one of the attributes of
living things. Lower plants, microbes and
animals reproduce by different methods
(fragmentation, gemma, binary fission,
budding, regeneration). Organisms reproduce
through asexual and sexual methods. Asexual
methods in angiosperms occur through natural
or artificial methods. The natural methods
take place through vegetative propagules or
diaspores. Artificial method of reproduction
involves cutting, layering and grafting.
Micropropagation is a modern method used
to raise new plants.



Sexual
reproduction
includes
gametogenesis and fertilization. External
fertilization occurs in lower plants like algae
but in higher plants internal fertilization
takes place. A flower is a modified shoot
meant for reproduction. Stamen is the male
reproductive part and produces pollen grains.
The development of microspore is called
microsporogenesis. The microspore mother
cell undergoes meiotic division to produce
four haploid microspores. In majority of
Angiosperms the anther is dithecous and
are tetrasporangiate. It possesses epidermis,
endothecium, middle layers and tapetum.
The hygroscopic nature of endothecial cell
along with thin walled stomium helps in the
dehiscence of anther. Tapetum nourishes the
microspores and also contributes to the wall
materials of the pollen grain. Pollen grain is
derived from the microspore and possesses
thin inner intine and thick outer exine.
Sporopollenin is present in exine and is resistant
to physiological and biological decomposition.
Microspore is the first cell of male gametophyte.
The nucleus of the microspore divides to form
a vegetative nucleus and a generative nucleus.
The generative nucleus divides to form
two male nuclei. Gynoecium is the female
reproductive part of a flower and it represents
one or more pistils. The ovary bears ovules
which are attached to the placenta. There are
six major types of ovules. The development
of megaspore from megaspore mother cell
is called megasporogenesis. A monosporic
embryo sac (Polygonum type) possesses three
antipodals in chalazal end, Three cells in the
micropylar end constituting egg apparatus(1
gg and 2 Synergids) and two polar nucleus
fused to form secondary nucleus. Thus, a
7 celled 8 nucleated Embryo sac is present.
The transfer of pollen grains to the
stigma of a flower is called pollination. Self-
pollination and cross-pollination are two
types of pollination. Double fertilization
and triple fusion are characteristic features
of angiosperms. After fertilization the ovary
transforms into a fruit and the ovule becomes
a seed. Endosperm is triploid in angiosperms
and is of three types – Nuclear, cellular, helobial.
Reproduction which doesn’t involve meiosis
and syngamy is called apomixis. Occurrence
of more than one embryo in a seed is called
polyembryony. Formation of fruit without the
act of fertilization is called parthenocarpy.
