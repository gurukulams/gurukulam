One of the essential features of all living things
on the earth is reproduction. Reproduction is a
vital process for the existence of a species and it
also brings suitable changes through variation in
the offsprings for their survival on earth. Plant
reproduction is important not only for its own
survival but also for the continuation and existence
of all other organisms since the latter directly or
indirectly depend on plants. Reproduction also
plays an important role in evolution.


In this unit let us learn in detail about
reproduction in plants.


Basically reproduction occurring in
organisms fall under **two major** categories


1. Asexual reproduction
2. Sexual reproduction
