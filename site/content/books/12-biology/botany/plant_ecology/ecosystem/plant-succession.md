### Plant Succession




We very often see that forests and lands in our
areas are drastically affected by natural calamities
(Flood, earthquake) and anthropogenic
activities (Fire, over grazing, cutting of trees).
Due to these reasons all plants of an area are
destroyed and the areas become nude. When we
observe this area, over a period of a time we can see that it will be gradually covered by
plant community again and become
fertile. Such successive replacement
of one type of plant community by
the other of the same area/ place is
known as plant **succession**. The first
invaded plants in a barren area are
called **pioneers**. On the other hand,
a series of transitional developments
of plant communities one after
another in a given area are called **seral**
**communities**. At the end a final stage and a
final plant community gets established which
are called as climax and climax community
respectively.






#### Characteristics of ecological succession


• It is a systematic process which causes changes
in specific structure of plant community.


• It is resultant of changes of abiotic and
biotic factors.


• It transforms unstable community into a
stable community.


• Gradual progression in species diversity,
total biomass, niche specialisation, and
humus content of soil takes place.


• It progresses from simple food chain to
complex food web.


• It modifies the lower and simple life form
to the higher life forms.


• It creates inter-dependence of plants and
animals.


#### Types of succession


The various types of succession have been
classified in different ways on the basis of
different aspects. These are as follows:



**1. Primary succession** - The development
of plant community in a barren area where no
community existed before is called primary
succession. The plants which colonize first in a barren area is called **pioneer** **species** or
**primary community** or **primary colonies**.
Generally, Primary succession takes a very
long time for the occurrence in any region.


**Example**: Microbes, Lichen, Mosses.



2. **Secondary succession**- The development of
a plant community in an area where an already
developed community has been destroyed by
some natural disturbance (Fire, flood, human
activity) is known as **secondary** **succession**.
Generally, This succession takes less time than
the time taken for primary succession.

**Example**: The forest destroyed by fire and
excessive lumbering may be re-occupied by
herbs over a period of times.


**3. Allogenic succession**


Allogeneic succession occurs as a result of abiotic factors. The replacement of existing
community is caused by other external factors
(soil erosion, leaching, etc.,) and not by existing
organisms.


Example: In a forest ecosystem soil erosion
and leaching alter the nutrient value of the soil
leading to the change of vegetation in that area.

#### Classification of plant succession


Detailed study of Hydrosere and Lithosere are
discussed below

![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/33.9.png )



##### Hydrosere


The succession in a freshwater ecosystem is
also referred to as hydrosere. Succession in a
pond, begins with colonization of the pioneers
like phytoplankton and finally ends with the
formation of climax community like forest
stage. It includes the following stages Fig 7.21.




**1. Phytoplankton stage** - It is the first stage
of succession consisting of the pioneer
community like blue green algae, green algae,
diatoms, bacteria, etc., The colonization
of these organisms enrich the amount of
organic matter and nutrients of pond due to
their life activities and death. This favors the
development of the next seral stages.






2. **Submerged plant stage** - As the result of death
and decomposition of planktons, silt brought
from land by rain water, lead to a loose mud
formation at the bottom of the pond. Hence,
the rooted submerged hydrophytes begin
to appear on the new substratum. Example:
*Chara*, *Utricularia*, *Vallisneria* and *Hydrilla* etc.
The death and decay of these plants will build
up the substratum of pond to become shallow.
Therefore, this habitat now replaces another
group of plants which are of floating type.




3. **Submerged free floating stage** - During
this stage, the depth of the pond will become
almost 2-5 feet. Hence, the rooted hydrophytic
plants and with floating large leaves start
colonising the pond. Example: Rooted floating
plants like *Nelumbo, Nymphaea and Trapa*.
Some free floating species like *Azolla, Lemna*,
*Wolffia and Pistia* are also present in this stage.
By death and decomposition of these plants,
further the pond becomes more shallow.
Due to this reason, floating plant species is
gradually replaced by another species which makes new seral stage.




**4. Reed-swamp stage** - It is also called an
amphibious stage. During this stage, rooted
floating plants are replaced by plants which
can live successfully in aquatic as well as aerial
environment. Example: *Typha, Phragmites*,
*Sagittaria and Scirpus* etc. At the end of this
stage, water level is very much reduced, making
it unsuitable for the continuous growth of
amphibious plants.




**5. Marsh meadow stage** - When the pond
becomes swallowed due to decreasing water
level, species of Cyperaceae and Poaceae such as
*Carex, Juncus, Cyperus* and Eleocharis colonise
the area. They form a mat-like vegetation with
the help of their much branched root system.
This leads to an absorption and loss of large
quantity of water. At the end of this stage, the
soil becomes dry and the marshy vegetation
disappears gradually and leads to shurb stage.



**6. Shrub stage** - As the disappearance of marshy
vegetation continues, soil becomes dry. Hence,
these areas are now invaded by terrestrial
plants like shrubs (*Salix and Cornus*) and trees
(*Populus and Alnus*). These plants absorb large
quantity of water and make the habitat dry.
Further, the accumulation of humus with a
rich flora of microorganisms produce minerals
in the soil, ultimately favouring the arrival of
new tree species in the area.


**7. Forest stage** - It is the climax community of
hydrosere. A variety of trees invade the area
and develop any one of the diverse type of
vegetation. Example:Temperate mixed forest
(*Ulmus,Acer and Quercus*), Tropical rain forest
(*Artocarpus and Cinnamomum* ) and Tropical
deciduous forest (*Bamboo and Tectona*).


In the 7 stages of hydrosere succession, stage1 is
occupied by pioneer community, while the stage
7 is occupied by the climax community. The
stages 2 to 6 are occupied by seral communities.

#### Significance of Plant Succession



• Succession is a dynamic
process. Hence an
ecologist can access and
study the seral stages of a
plant community found
in a particular area.




• The knowledge of
ecological succession helps to understand
the controlled growth of one or more species
in a forest.



• Utilizing the knowledge of succession, even
dams can be protected by preventing siltation.





• It gives information about the techniques to
be used during reforestation and afforestation.



• It helps in the maintenance of pastures.



• Plant succession helps to maintain species
diversity in an ecosystem.



• Patterns of diversity during succession
are influenced by resource availability and
disturbance by various factors.



• Primary succession involves the colonization
of habitat of an area devoid of life.



• Secondary succession involves the
reestablishment of a plant community in
disturbed area or habitat.



• Forests and vegetation that we come across
all over the world are the result of plant
succession.



##### Summary



The interaction between biotic and abiotic
components in an environment is called
ecosystem. Autotrophs and heterotrophs are
the producers and consumers respectively.
The function of ecosystem refers to creation of
energy, flow of energy and cycling of nutrients.
The amount of light available for photosynthesis
is called Photo synthetically Active Radiation .
It is essential for increase in the productivity of
ecosystem. The rate of biomass production per
unit area /time is called productivity. It is classified
as primary productivity, secondary productivity
and community productivity. The transfer of energy in an ecosystem can be termed as energy
flow. It is explained through the food chain, food
web, ecological pyramids (pyramid of number,
biomass and energy) and biogeochemical cycle.
Cycling of nutrients between abiotic and biotic
components is evident in the pond ecosystem,
making itself self sufficient and self regulating
Ecosystem protected for the welfare of posterity
is called ecosystem management.



Successive replacement of one type of plant
community by the other of the same area/
place is known as plant succession. The first
invaded plants in a barren (nude) area are called
pioneers (pioneers communities). On the other
hand, a series of transitional developments
of plant communities one after another in
a given area are called seral communities.
Succession is classified as primary succession,
secondary succession, allogeneic succession
and autotrophic succession. Plant succession
is classified in to hydrosere (Initiating on a
water bodies) ,Mesosere and xerosere. Further
xerosere is subdivided in to Lithosere ( Initiating
on a barren rock), Halosere and Pasmmosere.
