### Alien invasive species

Invasion of alien or introduced species disrupts
ecosystem processes, threaten biodiversity,
reduce native herbs, thus reducing the ecosystem
services (benefits). During eradication of
these species, the chemicals used increases
greenhouse gases. Slowly they alter ecosystem,
micro climate and nature of soil and make it
unsuitable for native species and create human
health problems like allergy, thus resulting in
local environmental degradation and loss of
important local species.

According to World Conservation Union
invasive alien species are the second most
significant threat to bio-diversity after habitat loss.

**What is invasive species?**


A non-native species to the ecosystem or country
under consideration that spreads naturally,
interferes with the biology and existence of
native species, poses a serious threat to the
ecosystem and causes economic loss.


It is established that a number of invasive
species are accidental introduction through
ports via air or sea. Some research organisations
import germplasm of wild varieties through
which also it gets introduced. Alien species with
edible fruits are usually spread by birds.


Invasive species are fast growing and are
more adapted. They alter the soil system by
changing litter quality thereby affecting the
soil community, soil fauna and the ecosystem
processes.

It has a negative impact on decomposition
in the soils by causing stress to the neighbouring
native species. Some of the alien species which
cause environmental issues are discussed below

##### Eichhornia crassipes



It is an invasive
weed native to
South America.
It was introduced
as aquatic
o r n a m e n t a l
plant, which
grows faster
throughout the
year. Its widespread growth is a major cause
of biodiversity loss worldwide. It affects the
growth of phytoplanktons and finally changing
the aquatic ecosystem.



It also decreases the oxygen content of the
waterbodies which leads to eutrophication. It
poses a threat to human health because it creates a
breeding habitat for disease causing mosquitoes
(particularly *Anopheles*) and snails with its
free floating dense roots and semi submerged
leaves. It also blocks sunlight entering deep and the waterways hampering agriculture, fisheries,
recreation and hydropower.

##### Prosopis juliflora



*Prosopis juliflora* is an invasive species native
to Mexico and South America. It was first
introduced in
Gujarat to counter
desertification and
later on in Andhra
Pradesh, Tamil
Nadu as a source
of firewood. It
is an aggressive
coloniser and as a
consequence the
habitats are rapidly covered by this species. Its
invasion reduced the cover of native medicinal
herbaceous species. It is used to arrest wind
erosion and stabilize sand dunes on coastal and
desert areas. It can absorb hazardous chemicals
from soil and it is the main source of charcoal.
