### Learning Objectives

* Understand the importance of
growing more plants to mitigate the
environmental problems.


* Distinguish between the importance
and conservation of endemic and
endangered species.

* Appreciate the use of technologies for
agriculture and forestry.


* Participate in community activities to
improve environmental conditions.


* Develop methods in conservation
of water and plants for sustainable
development.

* Get acquainted with satellite
technology and utilising it in our daily
life need.

After understanding the structure and functions
of major ecosystems of the world, now student
community should observe and understand
environmental problems of their surroundings
at local, national and international level.
Now we are going to understand some of the
environmental issues such as


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/8.1.png )



Environmental issues are the problems and
harmful effects created by human’s unmindful
activity and over utilisation of valuable resources
obtained from the nature (environment). Student
should understand not only the environmental
issues we are facing now, but also find solutions
to rectify or reduce these problems.



Countries of the world agree that something needs
to be done about these important environmental
issues. Many global summits, conferences and
conventions are regularly conducted by the United
Nations and many steps are taken to minimise
human-induced issues by signing agreements
with around 150 countries.

Drastic increase in population resulted in demand for more productivity of food materials, fibres, fuels which led to many environmental issues in agriculture, land use modifications resulting in loss of biodiversity, land degradation, reduction in fresh water availability and also resulting in man-made global warming by green house gases even altering climatic conditions.







### Conservation

India due to its topography, geology and
climate patterns has diverse life forms. Now
this huge diversity is under threat due to many
environmental issues for this conservation
becomes an important tool by which we can reduce many species getting lost from our native
land. By employing conservation management
strategies like germplasm conservation, in situ,
ex-situ, in-vitro methods, the endemic as well
as threatened species can be protected.

#### Glossary



**Algae** **Blooms**: Sudden sprout of algae growth,
which can affect the water quality adversely and
indicate potentially hazardous changes in local
water chemistry.


**Atmosphere**: A major regional community of
plants and animals with similar life forms and
environmental conditions.


**Biodegradable** **waste**: Organic waste, typically
coming from a plant or animal sources, which
other living organisms can break done.


**Biosphere**: The portion of earth and its
atmosphere that can support life.


**Oil** **spill**: The harmful release of oil into the
environment, usually through water, which is
very difficult to clean up and often kills, birds,
fish and other wildlife.




**Radiation**: A form of energy that is transmitted
in waves, rays or particles from a natural source
such as the sun and the ground or an artificial
source such as an X-ray machine.


**Radioactive**: A materials is said to be radioactive
if it emits radiation.





**Recycle**:To break waste items done into their
raw materials, which are then used to remake
the original item or to make new items.



**Sustainable** **development**: Development using
hand of energy sources in a way that meets the
needs of people today without reducing the
ability in future generation to meet their own
needs.
