India due to its topography, geology and
climate patterns has diverse life forms. Now
this huge diversity is under threat due to many
environmental issues for this conservation
becomes an important tool by which we can reduce many species getting lost from our native
land. By employing conservation management
strategies like germplasm conservation, in situ,
ex-situ, in-vitro methods, the endemic as well
as threatened species can be protected.

##### In-situ conservation

It means conservation and management of
genetic resources in their natural habitats. Here
the plant or animal species are protected within
the existing habitat. Forest trees, medicinal and
aromatic plants under threat are conserved
by this method. This is carried out by the
community or by the State conservation which
include wildlife, National park and Biosphere
reserve. The ecologically unique and biodiversity
rich regions are legally protected as wildlife
sanctuaries, National parks and Biosphere
reserves. Megamalai, Sathyamangalam wildlife,
Guindy and Periyar National park, and Western
ghats, Nilgiris, Agasthyamalai and Gulf of
Mannar are the biosphere reserves of Tamil
Nadu.


##### Sacred groves


These are the patches or grove of cultivated trees
which are community protected and are based
on strong religious belief systems which usually
have a significant religious connotation for
protecting community. Each grove is an abode
of a deity mostly village God Or Goddesses
like Aiyanar or Amman. 448 grooves were
documented throughout Tamil Nadu, of which
6 groves (Banagudi shola, Thirukurungudi and
Udaiyankudikadu, Sittannnavasal, Puthupet
and Devadanam) were taken up for detailed
floristic and faunistic studies. These groves
provide a number of ecosystem services to
the neighbourhood like protecting watershed,
fodder, medicinal plants and micro climate control.

##### Ex-situ conservation

It is a method of conservation where species are
protected outside their natural environment.
This includes establishment of botanical gardens,
zoological parks, conservation strategies such
as gene, pollen, seed, in-vitro conservation,
cryo preservation, seedling, tissue culture and
DNA banks. These facilities not only provide
housing and care for endangered species, but
also have educational and recreational values
for the society

#### Endemic Centres and Endemic Plants

Endemic species are plants and animals that
exist only in one geographic region. Species can
be endemic to large or small areas of the earth.
Some are endemic to a particular continent,
some to a part of a continent and others to a
single island.

Any species found restricted to a specified
geographical area is referred to as ENDEMIC..
It may be due to various reasons such as
isolation, interspecific interactions, seeds
dispersal problems, site specificity and many
other environmental and ecological problems.
There are 3 Megacentres of endemism and 27
microendemic centres in India. Approximately
one third of Indian flora have been identified as
endemic and found restricted and distributed in
three major phytogeographical regions of india,
that is Indian Himalayas, Peninsular India and
Andaman nicobar islands. Peninsular India,
especially Western Ghats has high concentration
of endemic plants. *Hardwickia binata* and
*Bentinckia condapanna* are good examples for
endemic plants. A large percentage of Endemic
species are herbs and belong to families such as
Poaceae. Apiaceae, Asteraceae and Orchidaceae.

Majority of endemic species are threatened
due to their narrow specific habitat, reduced seed
production, low dispersal rate, less viable natureand human intereferences.. Serious efforts need to
be undertaken for their conservation, otherwise
these species may become globally extinct.
