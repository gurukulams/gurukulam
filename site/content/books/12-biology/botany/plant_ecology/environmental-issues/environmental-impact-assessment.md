Environmental Impact Assessment is an
environmental management tool. It helps to
regulate and recommend optimal use of natural
resources with minimum impact on ecosystem
and biotic communities. It is used to predict the
environmental consequences of future proposed
developmental projects (example: river projects,
dams, highway projects) taking into account
inter-related socio-economic, cultural and
human-health impacts. It reduces environmental
stress thus helping to shape the projects that
may suit local environment by ensuring optimal
utilization of natural resources and disposal of
wastes to avoid environmental degradation.

**The benefits of EIA to society**

• A healthier environment

• Maintenance of biodiversity

• Decreased resource usage

• Reduction in gas emission and
environment damage


**Biomonitoring**


The act of observing and assessing the current
state and ongoing changes in ecosystem,
biodiversity components, landscape including
natural habitats, populations and species.
An agricultural drone is an unmanned aerial
vehicle applied to farming in order to help
increased crop production and monitor crop
growth. Agricultural drones let farmers see
their fields from the sky. This bird’s eye-view
can reveal many issues such as irrigation
problems, soil variation and pest and fungal
infestations. It is also used for cost effective safe
method of spraying pesticides and fertilizers,
which proves very easy and non-harmful.

#### Biodiversity Impact Assessment (BIA)



Biodiversity Impact Assessment can be
defined as a decision supporting tool to help
biodiversity inclusive of development, planning
and implementation. It aims at ensuring
development proposals which integrate bio-
diversity considerations. They are legally
compliant and include mechanisms for the
conservation of bio-diversity resources and
provide fair and equitable sharing of the benefits
arising from the use of bio-diversity.



**Bio-diversity impacts can be assessed by**

• Change in land use and cover

• Fragmentation and isolation

• Extraction

• External inputs such as emissions, effluents
and chemicals

• Introduction of invasive, alien or genetically
modified species

• Impact on endemic and threatened flora and
fauna.
