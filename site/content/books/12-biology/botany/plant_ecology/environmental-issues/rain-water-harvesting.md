### Rain water harvesting – RWH (Solution to water crisis – A ecological problem)


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/8.19.png )




Rainwater harvesting is the accumulation and
storage of rain water for reuse in-site rather than
allowing it to run off. Rainwater can be collected
from rivers, roof tops and the water collected
is directed to a deep pit. The water percolates
and gets stored in the pit. RWH is a sustainable
water management practice implemented not
only in urban area but also in agricultural fields,
which is an important economical cost effective
method for the future.





#### Environmental benefits of Rain   Water Harvesting:



• Promotes adequacy of underground water
and water conservation.


• Mitigates the effect of drought.





• Reduces soil erosion as surface run-off is
reduced.




• Reduces flood hazards.





• Improves groundwater quality and water
table / decreases salinity.





• Avoid land wastage for storage purpose and
no population displacement is involved.




• Stores water underground as an eco-friendly
measure and us a part of sustainable water
storage strategy for local communities.




#### Importance of Lakes



Water bodies like lakes, ponds not only provide
us a number of environmental benefits but
they strengthen our economy as well as our
quality of life like health. Lakes as a storage of
rain water provide drinking water, improves
ground water level and preserve the fresh water
bio-diversity and habitat of the area where it
occurs.


In terms of services lakes offer sustainable
solutions to key issues of water management
and climatic influences and benefits like
nutrient retention, influencing local rainfall,
removal of pollutants, phosphorous and
nitrogen and carbon sequestration.
