Green House Effect is a process by which radiant heat from the sun is captured by gases in the atmosphere that increase the temperature of the earth ultimately. The gases that capture heat are called Green House Gases which include carbon dioxide \\( (CO_2) \\), methane \\( (CH_4) \\), Nitrous Oxide \\( (N_2O) \\) and a variety of manufactured chemicals like chlorofluorocarbon (CFC). Increase in greenhouse gases lead to irreversible changes

in major ecosystems and climate patterns. For example, coral ecosystem is affected by increase in temperature, especially **coral** **bleaching** observed in Gulf of Mannar, Tamil Nadu.


**Human activities lead to produce the green house effect by**


• Burning fossil fuels, which releases \\( (CO_2) \\) and
\\( (CH_4) \\)


• Way of Agriculture and animal husbandry
practices


• Electrical gadgets like refrigerator and air
conditioners release chloro fluoro carbons



• The fertilizers used in Agriculture which
release \\( (N_2O) \\)


• The emissions from automobiles.
The increase in mean global temperature (highest
in 4000 years) due to increased concentration of
green house gases is called global warming.
One of the reasons for this is over population
which creates growing need for food, fibre and
fuel and considered to be the major cause of
**global warming**.

##### 8.1.1. Effects of Global Warming


• Rise in global temperature which causes sea
levels to rise as polar ice caps and glaciers
begin to melt causing submergence of many
coastal cities in many parts of the world.



• There will be a drastic change in weather
patterns bringing more floods or droughts
in some areas.



• Biological diversity may get modified,
some species ranges get redefined. Tropics
and sub-tropics may face the problem of
decreased food production.




##### 8.1.2. Sources of Green House Gases Emission (Natural and Anthropogenic)


**\\( (CO_2) \\)   (Carbon dioxide)**



• Coal based power plants, by the burning of
fossil fuels for electricity generation.


• Combustion of fuels in the engines of
automobiles, commercial vehicles and air
planes contribute the most of global warming.



• Agricultural practices like stubble burning
result in emission of \\( (CO_2) \\ ).



• Natural from organic matter, volcanoes,
warm oceans and sediments.




**Methane**



Methane is 20 times as effective as \\( (CO_2) \\ ) at
trapping heat in the atomosphere. Its sources
are attributed paddy cultivation, cattle rearing,
bacteria in water bodies, fossil fuel production,
ocean, non-wetland soils and forest / wild fires.




**\\( (N_2O) \\)  (Nitrous oxide)**



It is naturally produced in Oceans from biological
sources of soil and water due to microbial actions
and rainforests. Man-made sources include nylon
and nitric acid production, use of fertilizers in in
agriculture, manures cars with catalytic converter
and burning of organic matter.

#### Strategies to deal with Global Warming


• Increasing the vegetation cover, grow more
trees



• Reducing the use of fossil fuels and green
house gases

• Developing alternate renewable sources of
energy



• Minimising uses of nitrogeneous fertilizers,
and aerosols



##### 8.1.4. Ozone depletion




Ozone layer is a region of Earth’s stratosphere that
absorbs most of the Sun’s ultra violet radiation.
The ozone layer is also called as the **ozone** **shield**
and it acts as a protective shield, cutting the ultra-
violet radiation emitted by the sun.



Just above the atmosphere there are two
layers namely troposphere (the lower layer)
and stratosphere (the upper layer). The ozone
layer of the troposphere is called **bad** **ozone**
and the ozone layer of stratosphere is known as
**good** **ozone** because this layer acts as a shield
for absorbing the UV radiations coming from
the sun which is harmful for living organisms



![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/8.6.png )





causing DNA damage. The thickness of the
ozone column of air from the ground to the
top of the atmosphere is measured in terms of
**Dobson** **Units**.



The ozone shield is being damaged by
chemicals released on the Earth’s surface
notably the chlorofluorocarbons widely used
in refrigeration, aerosols, chemicals used as
cleaners in many industries. The decline in the
thickness of the ozone layer over restricted area
is called **Ozone** **hole**.



September 16 is **WORLD OZONE DAY**






Ozone depletion in the stratosphere
results in more UV radiations especially UV B
radiations (shortwaves). UV B radiation destroys
biomolecules (skin ageing) and damages living
tissues. UV – C is the most damaging type of
UV radiation, but it is completely filtered by the
atmosphere (ozone layer). UV – a contribute 95%
of UV radiation which causes tanning burning
of skin and enhancing skin cancer. Hence the
uniform ozone layer is critical for the wellbeing
of life on earth.







During 1970’s research findings indicated
that man-made chlorofluorocarbons (CFC)
reduce and convert ozone molecules in the
atmosphere. The threats associated with reduced
ozone pushed the issue to the forefront of global
climate issues and gained promotion through
organisation such as World Meterological
Organisation and the United Nations. The
Vienna Convention was agreed upon at the
Vienna conference of 1985 but entered into force in 1988 provided the frameworks necessary to
create regulative measures in the form of the
Montreal protocol. The International treaty
called the Montreal Protocol (1987) was held in
Canada on substances that deplete ozone layer
and the main goal of it is gradually eliminating
the production and consumption of ozone
depleting substances and to limit their damage
on the Earth’s ozone layer.




**Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)**
is defined in the **Kyoto** **protocol** (2007) which
provides project based mechanisms with two
objectives to prevent dangerous climate change
and to reduce green house gas emissions. CDM
projects helps the countries to reduce or limit
emission and stimulate sustainable development.



An example for CDM project activity, is
replacement of conventional electrification
projects with solar panels or other energy
efficient boilers. Such projects can earn Certified
Emission Reduction (CER) with credits / scores,
each equivalent to one tonne of CO 2, which can
be counted towards meeting Kyoto targets.

#### Effects of Ozone depletion



The main ozone depletion effects are:



• Increases the incidence of cataract, throat
and lung irritation and aggravation of
asthma or emphysema, skin cancer and
diminishing the functioning of immune
system in human beings.



• Juvenile mortality of animals.



• Increased incidence of mutations.




• In plants, photosynthetic chemicals will be
affected and therefore photosynthesis will
be inhibited. Decreased photosynthesis will
result in increased atmospheric \\( (CO_2) \\)  resulting
in global warming and also shortage of food
leading to food crisis.




• Increase in temperature changes the climate
and rainfall pattern which may result in
flood / drought, sea water rise, imbalance in
ecosystems affecting flora and fauna.
