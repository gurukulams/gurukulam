#### Agro forestry


Agroforestry is an integration of trees, crops
and livestock on the same plot of land. The main
objective is on the interaction among them .
Example: intercropping of two or more crops
between different species of trees and shrubs,
which results in higher yielding and reducing the
operation costs. This intentional combination
of agriculture and forestry has varied benefits
including increased bio-diversity and reduced
erosion.


Some of the major species cultivated in
commercial Agroforestry include *Casuarina*,
*Eucalyptus*, Malai Vembu, Teak and Kadambu
trees which were among the 20 species
identified as commercial timber. They are of
great importance to wood-based industries.


##### Benefits of agroforestry

*  It is an answer to the problem of soil and
water conservation and also to stabilise
the soil (salinity and water table) reduce
landslide and water run-off problem.


* Nutrient cycling between species improves
and organic matter is maintained.


* Trees provide micro climate for crops and
maintain \\( (O_2) \\)   â€“   \\( (CO_2) \\)   balanced, atmospheric
temperature and relative humidity.

* Suitable for dry land where rainfall is
minimum and hence it is a good system for
alternate land use pattern.

* Multipurpose tree varieties like Acacia are
used for wood pulp, tanning, paper and
firewood industries.


* Agro-forestry is recommended for the
following purposes. It can be used as
Farm Forestry for the extension of forests,
mixed forestry, shelter belts and linear strip
plantation.


##### Rehabilitation of degraded forests and recreation forestry

The production of woody plants combined
with pasture is referred to **silvopasture** system.
The trees and shrubs may be used primarily
to produce fodder for livestock or they may
be grown for timber, fuel wood and fruit or to
improve the soil.


This system is classified into following categories.



i. **Protein Bank**: In this various multipurpose
trees are planted in and around farm
lands and range lands mainly for fodder
production.


**Example**: *Acacia nilotica, Albizzia lebbek,Azadirachta indica, Gliricidia sepium,Sesbania grandiflora.*



ii.**Livefence of fodder trees and hedges**:


Various fodder trees and hedges are planted
as live fence to protect the property from
stray animals or other biotic influences.


Example: *Gliricidia sepium, Sesbania grandiflora, Erythrina spp., Acacia spp..*


#### Social forestry


It refers to the sustainable management of
forests by local communities with a goal
of climate carbon sequestration, change
mitigation, depollution, deforestation, forest
restoration and providing indirect employment
opportunity for the youth. Social forestry refers
to the **management of forests and afforestation on barren lands** with the purpose of helping the
environmental, social and rural development
and benefits. Forestry programme is done
for the benefit of people and participation of the people. Trees grown outside forests by
government and public organisation reduce the
pressure on forests.


In order to encourage tree cultivation outside
forests, **Tree cultivation in Private Lands** was
implemented in the state from 2007-08 to 2011-
12. It was implemented by carrying out block
planting and inter-crop planting with profitable
tree species like Teak, *Casuarina, Ailanthus*,
Silver Oak, etc. in the farming lands and by a
free supply of profitable tree species for planting
in the bunds. The **Tank foreshore plantations**
have been a major source of firewood in Tamil
Nadu. The 32 **Forestry extension centres**
provide technical support for tree growing in
rural areas in Tamil Nadu. These centres provide
quality tree seedlings like thorn / thornless
bamboo, *casuarinas*, teak, neem, *Melia dubia*,
grafted tamarind and nelli, etc. in private lands
and creating awareness among students by
training / camps.




#####  Major activities of forestry extension centres



* Training on tree growing methods



* Publicity and propaganda regarding tree
growing

* Formation of demonstration plots


* Raising and supply of seedlings on subsidy

* Awareness creation among school children
and youth about the importance of forests
through training and camps.
