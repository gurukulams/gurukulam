GIS is a computer system for capturing, storing,
checking and displaying data related to positions
on Earthâ€™s surface. Also to manipulate, analyse,
manage and present spacial or geographic data.

GPS is a satellite navigation system used to
determine the ground position of an object. It is
a **constellation** of approximately 30 well spaced
satellites that orbit the earth and make it possible
for the people with ground receivers to pinpoint
their geographic location. Some applications in
which GPS is currently being used for around
the world include Mining, Aviation, Surveying
Agricultural and Marine ecosystem.


**Importance of GIS**


* Environmental impact
assessment



* Disaster management

*  Zoning of landslide
hazards.


* Determination of land cover and land use


* Estimation of flood damage


* Management of natural resources


* Soil mapping


* Wetland mapping


* Irrigation management and identification of
volcanic hazard


* Vegetation studies and mapping of
threatened and endemic species.


**Remote** **Sensing** is the process of detecting and
monitoring the physical characteristics of an area
by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation
at a distance from the targeted area. It is an tool
used in conservation practices by giving exact
picture and data on identification of even a single
tree to large area of vegetation and wild life for
classification of land use patterns and studies,
identification of biodiversity rich or less areas for
futuristic works on conservation and maintenance
of various species including commercial crop,
medicinal plants and threatened plants.

**Specific uses**


* Helps predicting favourable climate, for the
study of spreading of disease and controlling it.


* Mapping of forest fire and species
distribution.

* Tracking the patterns of urban area
development and the changes in Farmland
or forests over several years


* Mapping ocean bottom and its resources

### Summary

Green house effect leads to climate change which
results in global warming. Deforestation causes
soil erosion, whereas Afforestation helps to
restore vegetation and increases ground water
table. Regeneration of trees by Agroforestry is
possible with the involvement of community
and government. Help to conserve the flora and
fauna in their natural habitat and man-made
environments like zoological parks and national
parks. Mitigation of carbon in the atmosphere
done in the form of sequestration. Rain water
harvesting is done for improving the ground
water table. Importance and location of lakes in
Tamil Nadu which aids water supply to the city
is a measure of conservation of drinking water.
Assessment of Environment and Biodiversity
helps to study risk analysis and disaster
management. Forest cover is monitored through
Remote sensing and GIS..
