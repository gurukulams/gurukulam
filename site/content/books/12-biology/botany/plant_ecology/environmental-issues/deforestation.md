### Deforestation

Deforestation is one of the major contributors
to enhance green house effect and global
warming. The conversion of forested area into
a non-forested area is known as deforestation.
Forests provide us many benefits including
goods such as timber, paper, medicine and
industrial products. The causes are


* The conversion of forests into agricultural
plantation and livestock ranching is a major cause of deforestation.

* Logging for timber


* Developmental activities like road
construction, electric tower lines and dams.



* Over population, Industrialisation,
urbanisation and increased global needs.



**Effects of deforestation**



* Burning of forest wood release stored
carbon, a negative impact just opposite of
carbon sequestration.


* Trees and plants bind the soil particles. The
removal of forest cover increases soil erosion
and decreases soil fertility. Deforestation in
dry areas leads to the formation of deserts.



* The amount of runoff water increases soil
erosion and also creates flash flooding, thus
reducing moisture and humidity.


* vThe alteration of local precipitation patterns
leading to drought conditions in many
regions. It triggers adverse climatic conditions
and alters water cycle in ecosystem.


* It decreases the bio-diversity significantly as
their habitats are disturbed and disruption
of natural cycles.


*  Loss of livelihood for forest dwellers and
rural people.


* Increased global warming and account for
one-third of total \\( (CO_2) \\)  emission.


* Loss of life support resources, fuel, medicinal
herbs and wild edible fruits.
