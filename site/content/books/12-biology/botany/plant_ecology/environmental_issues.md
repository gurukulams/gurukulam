After understanding the structure and functions
of major ecosystems of the world, now student
community should observe and understand
environmental problems of their surroundings
at local, national and international level.
Now we are going to understand some of the
environmental issues such as


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/8.1.png )



Environmental issues are the problems and
harmful effects created by human’s unmindful
activity and over utilisation of valuable resources
obtained from the nature (environment). Student
should understand not only the environmental
issues we are facing now, but also find solutions
to rectify or reduce these problems.



Countries of the world agree that something needs
to be done about these important environmental
issues. Many global summits, conferences and
conventions are regularly conducted by the United
Nations and many steps are taken to minimise
human-induced issues by signing agreements
with around 150 countries.




![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/8.2.png )


Drastic increase in population resulted
in demand for more productivity of food
materials, fibres, fuels which led to many
environmental issues in agriculture, land use
modifications resulting in loss of biodiversity,
land degradation, reduction in fresh water
availability and also resulting in man-made
global warming by green house gases even
altering climatic conditions.



### Green House effect and Global Warming



Green House Effect is a process by which
radiant heat from the sun is captured by gases
in the atmosphere
that increase the
temperature of the
earth ultimately.
The gases that
capture heat are
called Green
House Gases which
include carbon
dioxide \\( (CO_2) \\),
methane \\( (CH_4) \\),
Nitrous Oxide \\( (N_2O) \\) and a variety of manufactured chemicals
like chlorofluorocarbon (CFC). Increase in
greenhouse gases lead to irreversible changes


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/8.3.png )



in major ecosystems and climate patterns. For
example, coral ecosystem is affected by increase
in temperature, especially **coral** **bleaching**
observed in Gulf of Mannar, Tamil Nadu.


**Human activities lead to produce the green house effect by**


• Burning fossil fuels, which releases \\( (CO_2) \\) and
\\( (CH_4) \\)


• Way of Agriculture and animal husbandry
practices


• Electrical gadgets like refrigerator and air
conditioners release chloro fluoro carbons



• The fertilizers used in Agriculture which
release \\( (N_2O) \\)


• The emissions from automobiles.
The increase in mean global temperature (highest
in 4000 years) due to increased concentration of
green house gases is called global warming.
One of the reasons for this is over population
which creates growing need for food, fibre and
fuel and considered to be the major cause of
**global warming**.




One of the reasons for this is over population
which creates growing need for food, fibre and
fuel and considered to be the major cause of
global warming.


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/8.4.png )


##### 8.1.1. Effects of Global Warming


• Rise in global temperature which causes sea
levels to rise as polar ice caps and glaciers
begin to melt causing submergence of many
coastal cities in many parts of the world.



• There will be a drastic change in weather
patterns bringing more floods or droughts
in some areas.



• Biological diversity may get modified,
some species ranges get redefined. Tropics
and sub-tropics may face the problem of
decreased food production.




##### 8.1.2. Sources of Green House Gases Emission (Natural and Anthropogenic)


**\\( (CO_2) \\)   (Carbon dioxide)**



• Coal based power plants, by the burning of
fossil fuels for electricity generation.


• Combustion of fuels in the engines of
automobiles, commercial vehicles and air
planes contribute the most of global warming.



• Agricultural practices like stubble burning
result in emission of \\( (CO_2) \\ ).



• Natural from organic matter, volcanoes,
warm oceans and sediments.




**Methane**



Methane is 20 times as effective as \\( (CO_2) \\ ) at
trapping heat in the atomosphere. Its sources
are attributed paddy cultivation, cattle rearing,
bacteria in water bodies, fossil fuel production,
ocean, non-wetland soils and forest / wild fires.




**\\( (N_2O) \\)  (Nitrous oxide)**



It is naturally produced in Oceans from biological
sources of soil and water due to microbial actions
and rainforests. Man-made sources include nylon
and nitric acid production, use of fertilizers in in
agriculture, manures cars with catalytic converter
and burning of organic matter.



![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/8.5.png )





#### Strategies to deal with Global Warming


• Increasing the vegetation cover, grow more
trees



• Reducing the use of fossil fuels and green
house gases

• Developing alternate renewable sources of
energy



• Minimising uses of nitrogeneous fertilizers,
and aerosols



##### 8.1.4. Ozone depletion




Ozone layer is a region of Earth’s stratosphere that
absorbs most of the Sun’s ultra violet radiation.
The ozone layer is also called as the **ozone** **shield**
and it acts as a protective shield, cutting the ultra-
violet radiation emitted by the sun.



Just above the atmosphere there are two
layers namely troposphere (the lower layer)
and stratosphere (the upper layer). The ozone
layer of the troposphere is called **bad** **ozone**
and the ozone layer of stratosphere is known as
**good** **ozone** because this layer acts as a shield
for absorbing the UV radiations coming from
the sun which is harmful for living organisms



![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/8.6.png )





causing DNA damage. The thickness of the
ozone column of air from the ground to the
top of the atmosphere is measured in terms of
**Dobson** **Units**.



The ozone shield is being damaged by
chemicals released on the Earth’s surface
notably the chlorofluorocarbons widely used
in refrigeration, aerosols, chemicals used as
cleaners in many industries. The decline in the
thickness of the ozone layer over restricted area
is called **Ozone** **hole**.



September 16 is **WORLD OZONE DAY**






Ozone depletion in the stratosphere
results in more UV radiations especially UV B
radiations (shortwaves). UV B radiation destroys
biomolecules (skin ageing) and damages living
tissues. UV – C is the most damaging type of
UV radiation, but it is completely filtered by the
atmosphere (ozone layer). UV – a contribute 95%
of UV radiation which causes tanning burning
of skin and enhancing skin cancer. Hence the
uniform ozone layer is critical for the wellbeing
of life on earth.







During 1970’s research findings indicated
that man-made chlorofluorocarbons (CFC)
reduce and convert ozone molecules in the
atmosphere. The threats associated with reduced
ozone pushed the issue to the forefront of global
climate issues and gained promotion through
organisation such as World Meterological
Organisation and the United Nations. The
Vienna Convention was agreed upon at the
Vienna conference of 1985 but entered into force in 1988 provided the frameworks necessary to
create regulative measures in the form of the
Montreal protocol. The International treaty
called the Montreal Protocol (1987) was held in
Canada on substances that deplete ozone layer
and the main goal of it is gradually eliminating
the production and consumption of ozone
depleting substances and to limit their damage
on the Earth’s ozone layer.




**Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)**
is defined in the **Kyoto** **protocol** (2007) which
provides project based mechanisms with two
objectives to prevent dangerous climate change
and to reduce green house gas emissions. CDM
projects helps the countries to reduce or limit
emission and stimulate sustainable development.



An example for CDM project activity, is
replacement of conventional electrification
projects with solar panels or other energy
efficient boilers. Such projects can earn Certified
Emission Reduction (CER) with credits / scores,
each equivalent to one tonne of CO 2, which can
be counted towards meeting Kyoto targets.



![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/8.7.png )



#### Effects of Ozone depletion



The main ozone depletion effects are:



• Increases the incidence of cataract, throat
and lung irritation and aggravation of
asthma or emphysema, skin cancer and
diminishing the functioning of immune
system in human beings.



• Juvenile mortality of animals.



• Increased incidence of mutations.




• In plants, photosynthetic chemicals will be
affected and therefore photosynthesis will
be inhibited. Decreased photosynthesis will
result in increased atmospheric \\( (CO_2) \\)  resulting
in global warming and also shortage of food
leading to food crisis.




• Increase in temperature changes the climate
and rainfall pattern which may result in
flood / drought, sea water rise, imbalance in
ecosystems affecting flora and fauna.




### Forestry






#### Agro forestry



Agroforestry is an integration of trees, crops
and livestock on the same plot of land. The main
objective is on the interaction among them .
Example: intercropping of two or more crops
between different species of trees and shrubs,
which results in higher yielding and reducing the
operation costs. This intentional combination
of agriculture and forestry has varied benefits
including increased bio-diversity and reduced
erosion.



Some of the major species cultivated in
commercial Agroforestry include *Casuarina*,
*Eucalyptus*, Malai Vembu, Teak and Kadambu
trees which were among the 20 species
identified as commercial timber. They are of
great importance to wood-based industries.



##### Benefits of agroforestry



• It is an answer to the problem of soil and
water conservation and also to stabilise
the soil (salinity and water table) reduce
landslide and water run-off problem.



• Nutrient cycling between species improves
and organic matter is maintained.



• Trees provide micro climate for crops and
maintain \\( (O_2) \\)   –   \\( (CO_2) \\)   balanced, atmospheric
temperature and relative humidity.



• Suitable for dry land where rainfall is
minimum and hence it is a good system for
alternate land use pattern.


• Multipurpose tree varieties like Acacia are
used for wood pulp, tanning, paper and
firewood industries.



• Agro-forestry is recommended for the
following purposes. It can be used as
Farm Forestry for the extension of forests,
mixed forestry, shelter belts and linear strip
plantation.




##### Rehabilitation of degraded forests and recreation forestry



The production of woody plants combined
with pasture is referred to **silvopasture** system.
The trees and shrubs may be used primarily
to produce fodder for livestock or they may
be grown for timber, fuel wood and fruit or to
improve the soil.


This system is classified into following categories.



i. **Protein Bank**: In this various multipurpose
trees are planted in and around farm
lands and range lands mainly for fodder
production.


**Example**: *Acacia nilotica, Albizzia lebbek,Azadirachta indica, Gliricidia sepium,Sesbania grandiflora.*



ii.**Livefence of fodder trees and hedges**:


Various fodder trees and hedges are planted
as live fence to protect the property from
stray animals or other biotic influences.





Example: *Gliricidia sepium, Sesbania grandiflora, Erythrina spp., Acacia spp..*



#### Social forestry



It refers to the sustainable management of
forests by local communities with a goal
of climate carbon sequestration, change
mitigation, depollution, deforestation, forest
restoration and providing indirect employment
opportunity for the youth. Social forestry refers
to the **management of forests and afforestation on barren lands** with the purpose of helping the
environmental, social and rural development
and benefits. Forestry programme is done
for the benefit of people and participation of the people. Trees grown outside forests by
government and public organisation reduce the
pressure on forests.



In order to encourage tree cultivation outside
forests, **Tree cultivation in Private Lands** was
implemented in the state from 2007-08 to 2011-
12. It was implemented by carrying out block
planting and inter-crop planting with profitable
tree species like Teak, *Casuarina, Ailanthus*,
Silver Oak, etc. in the farming lands and by a
free supply of profitable tree species for planting
in the bunds. The **Tank foreshore plantations**
have been a major source of firewood in Tamil
Nadu. The 32 **Forestry extension centres**
provide technical support for tree growing in
rural areas in Tamil Nadu. These centres provide
quality tree seedlings like thorn / thornless
bamboo, *casuarinas*, teak, neem, *Melia dubia*,
grafted tamarind and nelli, etc. in private lands
and creating awareness among students by
training / camps.




##### 8.2.3. Major activities of forestry extension centres



• Training on tree growing methods



• Publicity and propaganda regarding tree
growing



• Formation of demonstration plots



• Raising and supply of seedlings on subsidy



• Awareness creation among school children
and youth about the importance of forests
through training and camps.



### Deforestation



Deforestation is one of the major contributors
to enhance green house effect and global
warming. The conversion of forested area into
a non-forested area is known as deforestation.
Forests provide us many benefits including
goods such as timber, paper, medicine and
industrial products. The causes are





• The conversion of forests into agricultural
plantation and livestock ranching is a major cause of deforestation.



• Logging for timber



• Developmental activities like road
construction, electric tower lines and dams.



• Over population, Industrialisation,
urbanisation and increased global needs.



**Effects of deforestation**



• Burning of forest wood release stored
carbon, a negative impact just opposite of
carbon sequestration.



• Trees and plants bind the soil particles. The
removal of forest cover increases soil erosion
and decreases soil fertility. Deforestation in
dry areas leads to the formation of deserts.



• The amount of runoff water increases soil
erosion and also creates flash flooding, thus
reducing moisture and humidity.



• The alteration of local precipitation patterns
leading to drought conditions in many
regions. It triggers adverse climatic conditions
and alters water cycle in ecosystem.



• It decreases the bio-diversity significantly as
their habitats are disturbed and disruption
of natural cycles.



• Loss of livelihood for forest dwellers and
rural people.



• Increased global warming and account for
one-third of total \\( (CO_2) \\)  emission.



• Loss of life support resources, fuel, medicinal
herbs and wild edible fruits.



### Afforestation



Afforestation is planting of trees where there was
no previous tree coverage and the conversion
of non-forested lands into forests by planting
suitable trees to retrieve the vegetation. Example:
Slopes of dams afforested to reduce water run-
off, erosion and siltation. It can also provide
a range of environmental services including
carbon sequestration, water retention.


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/8.8.png )



**Afforestation Objectives**


• To increase forest cover, planting more trees,
increases\\( (O_2) \\)
production and air quality.



• Rehabilitation of degraded forests to
increase carbon fixation and reducing \\( (CO_2) \\)
from atmosphere.



• Raising bamboo plantations.



• Mixed plantations of minor forest produce
and medicinal plants.



• Regeneration of indigenous herbs / shrubs.



• Awareness creation, monitoring and
evaluation.



• To increase the level and availability of water
table or ground water and also to reduce
nitrogen leaching in soil and nitrogen
contamination of drinking water, thus
making it pure not polluted with nitrogen.



• Nature aided artificial regeneration.


**Achievements**



• Degraded forests were restored



• Community assets like overhead tanks
bore-wells, hand pumps, community halls,
libraries, etc were 



• Environmental and ecological stability was
maintained.



• Conserved bio-diversity, wildlife and genetic
resources.



• Involvement of community especially
women in forest management.



### Alien invasive species



Invasion of alien or introduced species disrupts
ecosystem processes, threaten biodiversity,
reduce native herbs, thus reducing the ecosystem
services (benefits). During eradication of
these species, the chemicals used increases
greenhouse gases. Slowly they alter ecosystem,
micro climate and nature of soil and make it
unsuitable for native species and create human
health problems like allergy, thus resulting in
local environmental degradation and loss of
important local species.



According to World Conservation Union
invasive alien species are the second most
significant threat to bio-diversity after habitat loss.



**What is invasive species?**



A non-native species to the ecosystem or country
under consideration that spreads naturally,
interferes with the biology and existence of
native species, poses a serious threat to the
ecosystem and causes economic loss.



It is established that a number of invasive
species are accidental introduction through
ports via air or sea. Some research organisations
import germplasm of wild varieties through
which also it gets introduced. Alien species with
edible fruits are usually spread by birds.




Invasive species are fast growing and are
more adapted. They alter the soil system by
changing litter quality thereby affecting the
soil community, soil fauna and the ecosystem
processes.



It has a negative impact on decomposition
in the soils by causing stress to the neighbouring
native species. Some of the alien species which
cause environmental issues are discussed below




##### Eichhornia crassipes



It is an invasive
weed native to
South America.
It was introduced
as aquatic
o r n a m e n t a l
plant, which
grows faster
throughout the
year. Its widespread growth is a major cause
of biodiversity loss worldwide. It affects the
growth of phytoplanktons and finally changing
the aquatic ecosystem.



It also decreases the oxygen content of the
waterbodies which leads to eutrophication. It
poses a threat to human health because it creates a
breeding habitat for disease causing mosquitoes
(particularly *Anopheles*) and snails with its
free floating dense roots and semi submerged
leaves. It also blocks sunlight entering deep and the waterways hampering agriculture, fisheries,
recreation and hydropower.






![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/8.10.png )




##### Prosopis juliflora



*Prosopis juliflora* is an invasive species native
to Mexico and South America. It was first
introduced in
Gujarat to counter
desertification and
later on in Andhra
Pradesh, Tamil
Nadu as a source
of firewood. It
is an aggressive
coloniser and as a
consequence the
habitats are rapidly covered by this species. Its
invasion reduced the cover of native medicinal
herbaceous species. It is used to arrest wind
erosion and stabilize sand dunes on coastal and
desert areas. It can absorb hazardous chemicals
from soil and it is the main source of charcoal.

![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/8.11.png )


### Conservation




India due to its topography, geology and
climate patterns has diverse life forms. Now
this huge diversity is under threat due to many
environmental issues for this conservation
becomes an important tool by which we can reduce many species getting lost from our native
land. By employing conservation management
strategies like germplasm conservation, in situ,
ex-situ, in-vitro methods, the endemic as well
as threatened species can be protected.


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/8.12.png )




![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/8.13.png )












##### In-situ conservation



It means conservation and management of
genetic resources in their natural habitats. Here
the plant or animal species are protected within
the existing habitat. Forest trees, medicinal and
aromatic plants under threat are conserved
by this method. This is carried out by the
community or by the State conservation which
include wildlife, National park and Biosphere
reserve. The ecologically unique and biodiversity
rich regions are legally protected as wildlife
sanctuaries, National parks and Biosphere
reserves. Megamalai, Sathyamangalam wildlife,
Guindy and Periyar National park, and Western
ghats, Nilgiris, Agasthyamalai and Gulf of
Mannar are the biosphere reserves of Tamil
Nadu.



##### Sacred groves



These are the patches or grove of cultivated trees
which are community protected and are based
on strong religious belief systems which usually
have a significant religious connotation for
protecting community. Each grove is an abode
of a deity mostly village God Or Goddesses
like Aiyanar or Amman. 448 grooves were
documented throughout Tamil Nadu, of which
6 groves (Banagudi shola, Thirukurungudi and
Udaiyankudikadu, Sittannnavasal, Puthupet
and Devadanam) were taken up for detailed
floristic and faunistic studies. These groves
provide a number of ecosystem services to
the neighbourhood like protecting watershed,
fodder, medicinal plants and micro climate control.


##### Ex-situ conservation


It is a method of conservation where species are
protected outside their natural environment.
This includes establishment of botanical gardens,
zoological parks, conservation strategies such
as gene, pollen, seed, in-vitro conservation,
cryo preservation, seedling, tissue culture and
DNA banks. These facilities not only provide
housing and care for endangered species, but
also have educational and recreational values
for the society



#### Endemic Centres and Endemic Plants



Endemic species are plants and animals that
exist only in one geographic region. Species can
be endemic to large or small areas of the earth.
Some are endemic to a particular continent,
some to a part of a continent and others to a
single island.



Any species found restricted to a specified
geographical area is referred to as ENDEMIC..
It may be due to various reasons such as
isolation, interspecific interactions, seeds
dispersal problems, site specificity and many
other environmental and ecological problems.
There are 3 Megacentres of endemism and 27
microendemic centres in India. Approximately
one third of Indian flora have been identified as
endemic and found restricted and distributed in
three major phytogeographical regions of india,
that is Indian Himalayas, Peninsular India and
Andaman nicobar islands. Peninsular India,
especially Western Ghats has high concentration
of endemic plants. *Hardwickia binata* and
*Bentinckia condapanna* are good examples for
endemic plants. A large percentage of Endemic
species are herbs and belong to families such as
Poaceae. Apiaceae, Asteraceae and Orchidaceae.


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/8.14.png )


Majority of endemic species are threatened
due to their narrow specific habitat, reduced seed
production, low dispersal rate, less viable natureand human intereferences.. Serious efforts need to
be undertaken for their conservation, otherwise
these species may become globally extinct.


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/8.15.png )



### Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)



Carbon capture and storage is a technology of
capturing carbondioxide and injects it deep into
the underground rocks to a depth of 1 km or more
and it is an approach to mitigate global warming
by capturing \\( (CO_2) \\) from large point sources such
as industries and power plants and subsequently
storing it instead of releasing it into the
atmosphere. Various safe sites have been selected
for permanent storage in various deep geological
formations, liquid storage in the Ocean and solid
storage by reduction of \\( (CO_2) \\) with metal oxide to
produce stable carbonates. It is also known as
Geological sequestration which involves injecting
\\( (CO_2) \\) directly into the underground geological
formations (such as declining oil fields, gas fields
saline aquifers and unmineable coal have been
suggested as storage sites).



##### Carbon Sequestration


Carbon sequestration is the process of capturing
and storing \\( (CO_2) \\) which reduces the amount of
\\( (CO_2) \\) in the atmosphere with a goal of reducing
global climate change.



Carbon sequestration occurs naturally by plants
and in ocean. Terrestrial sequestration is typically
accomplished through forest and soil conservation
practices that enhance the storage carbon.



As an example microalgae such as species
of *Chlorella, Scenedesmus, Chroococcus* and
*Chlamydomonas* are used globally for \\( (CO_2) \\)
sequestration. Trees like *Eugenia caryophyllata*,
*Tecoma stans*, *Cinnamomum verum* have
high capacity and noted to sequester carbon.
Macroalgae and marine grasses and mangroves
are also have ability to mitigate carbon-di-oxide.



##### Carbon Foot Print (CFP)



Every human activity leaves a mark just like
our footprint. This **Carbon foot print** is the
total amount of green house gases produced by
human activities such as agriculture, industries,
deforestation, waste disposal, buring fossil
fuels directly or indirectly. It can be measured
for an individual, family, organisation like
industries, state level or national level. It is
usually estimated and expressed in equivalent
tons of \\( (CO_2) \\) per year. The burning of fossil
fuels releases \\( (CO_2) \\) and other green house gases.
In turn these emissions trap solar energy and
thus increase the global temperature resulting
in ice melting, submerging of low lying areas
and inbalance in nature like cyclones, tsunamis
and extreme weather conditions. To reduce
the carbon foot print we can
follow some practices like
(i) Eating indigenous fruits
and products (ii) Reducing
use of electronic devices (iii)
Reduce travelling (iv) Avoid
buying fast and preserved,
processed, packed foods. (v)
Plant a garden (vi) Reducing consumption of meat and
sea food. Poultry requires
little space, nutrients and less
pollution compared cattle

![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/8.16.png )



farming. (vii) reducing use of Laptops (when
used for 8 hours, it releases nearly 2 kg. of \\( (CO_2) \\)
annually) (viii) Line drying clothes. (Example:
If you buy imported fruit like kiwi, indirectly
it increases CFP. How? The fruit has travelled
a long distance in shipping or airliner thus
emitting tons of \\( (CO_2) \\)



##### Biochar



**Biochar** is another long term method to store
carbon. To increase plants ability to store more
carbon, plants are partly burnt such as crop
waste, waste woods to become carbon rich
slow decomposing substances of material called
Biochar. It is a kind of charcoal used as a soil
amendment. Biochar is a stable solid, rich in
carbon and can endure in soil for thousands of
years. Like most charcoal, biochar is made from
biomass via pyrolysis. (Heating biomas in low
oxygen environment) which arrests wood from
complete burning. Biochar thus has the potential
to help mitigate climate change via carbon


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/8.17.png )


sequestration. Independently, biochar when
added to soil can increase soil fertility of acidic
soils, increase agricultural productivity, and
provide protection against some foliar and soil
borne diseases. It is a good method of preventing
waste woods and logs from getting decayed and
instead we can convert them into biochar thus
converting them to carbon storage material.




### Rain water harvesting – RWH (Solution to water crisis – A ecological problem)


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/8.19.png )




Rainwater harvesting is the accumulation and
storage of rain water for reuse in-site rather than
allowing it to run off. Rainwater can be collected
from rivers, roof tops and the water collected
is directed to a deep pit. The water percolates
and gets stored in the pit. RWH is a sustainable
water management practice implemented not
only in urban area but also in agricultural fields,
which is an important economical cost effective
method for the future.





#### Environmental benefits of Rain   Water Harvesting:



• Promotes adequacy of underground water
and water conservation.


• Mitigates the effect of drought.





• Reduces soil erosion as surface run-off is
reduced.




• Reduces flood hazards.





• Improves groundwater quality and water
table / decreases salinity.





• Avoid land wastage for storage purpose and
no population displacement is involved.




• Stores water underground as an eco-friendly
measure and us a part of sustainable water
storage strategy for local communities.




#### Importance of Lakes



Water bodies like lakes, ponds not only provide
us a number of environmental benefits but
they strengthen our economy as well as our
quality of life like health. Lakes as a storage of
rain water provide drinking water, improves
ground water level and preserve the fresh water
bio-diversity and habitat of the area where it
occurs.


In terms of services lakes offer sustainable
solutions to key issues of water management
and climatic influences and benefits like
nutrient retention, influencing local rainfall,
removal of pollutants, phosphorous and
nitrogen and carbon sequestration.



### Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)



Environmental Impact Assessment is an
environmental management tool. It helps to
regulate and recommend optimal use of natural
resources with minimum impact on ecosystem
and biotic communities. It is used to predict the
environmental consequences of future proposed
developmental projects (example: river projects,
dams, highway projects) taking into account
inter-related socio-economic, cultural and
human-health impacts. It reduces environmental
stress thus helping to shape the projects that
may suit local environment by ensuring optimal
utilization of natural resources and disposal of
wastes to avoid environmental degradation.




**The benefits of EIA to society**



• A healthier environment


• Maintenance of biodiversity





• Decreased resource usage





• Reduction in gas emission and
environment damage




**Biomonitoring**





The act of observing and assessing the current
state and ongoing changes in ecosystem,
biodiversity components, landscape including
natural habitats, populations and species.
An agricultural drone is an unmanned aerial
vehicle applied to farming in order to help
increased crop production and monitor crop
growth. Agricultural drones let farmers see
their fields from the sky. This bird’s eye-view
can reveal many issues such as irrigation
problems, soil variation and pest and fungal
infestations. It is also used for cost effective safe
method of spraying pesticides and fertilizers,
which proves very easy and non-harmful.

![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/botany/images/8.20.png )


#### Biodiversity Impact Assessment (BIA)



Biodiversity Impact Assessment can be
defined as a decision supporting tool to help
biodiversity inclusive of development, planning
and implementation. It aims at ensuring
development proposals which integrate bio-
diversity considerations. They are legally
compliant and include mechanisms for the
conservation of bio-diversity resources and
provide fair and equitable sharing of the benefits
arising from the use of bio-diversity.



**Bio-diversity impacts can be assessed by**



• Change in land use and cover



• Fragmentation and isolation



• Extraction



• External inputs such as emissions, effluents
and chemicals



• Introduction of invasive, alien or genetically
modified species



• Impact on endemic and threatened flora and
fauna.



### Geographic Information System



GIS is a computer system for capturing, storing,
checking and displaying data related to positions
on Earth’s surface. Also to manipulate, analyse,
manage and present spacial or geographic data.



GPS is a satellite navigation system used to
determine the ground position of an object. It is
a **constellation** of approximately 30 well spaced
satellites that orbit the earth and make it possible
for the people with ground receivers to pinpoint
their geographic location. Some applications in
which GPS is currently being used for around
the world include Mining, Aviation, Surveying
Agricultural and Marine ecosystem.




**Importance of GIS**



• Environmental impact
assessment



• Disaster management
• Zoning of landslide
hazards.



• Determination of land cover and land use



• Estimation of flood damage



• Management of natural resources



• Soil mapping





• Wetland mapping




• Irrigation management and identification of
volcanic hazard



• Vegetation studies and mapping of
threatened and endemic species.




**Remote** **Sensing** is the process of detecting and
monitoring the physical characteristics of an area
by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation
at a distance from the targeted area. It is an tool
used in conservation practices by giving exact
picture and data on identification of even a single
tree to large area of vegetation and wild life for
classification of land use patterns and studies,
identification of biodiversity rich or less areas for
futuristic works on conservation and maintenance
of various species including commercial crop,
medicinal plants and threatened plants.



**Specific uses**


• Helps predicting favourable climate, for the
study of spreading of disease and controlling it.




• Mapping of forest fire and species
distribution.





• Tracking the patterns of urban area
development and the changes in Farmland
or forests over several years









• Mapping ocean bottom and its resources

##### Summary



Green house effect leads to climate change which
results in global warming. Deforestation causes
soil erosion, whereas Afforestation helps to
restore vegetation and increases ground water
table. Regeneration of trees by Agroforestry is
possible with the involvement of community
and government. Help to conserve the flora and
fauna in their natural habitat and man-made
environments like zoological parks and national
parks. Mitigation of carbon in the atmosphere
done in the form of sequestration. Rain water
harvesting is done for improving the ground
water table. Importance and location of lakes in
Tamil Nadu which aids water supply to the city
is a measure of conservation of drinking water.
Assessment of Environment and Biodiversity
helps to study risk analysis and disaster
management. Forest cover is monitored through
Remote sensing and GIS
