Many organisms, co-exist in an environment.
The environment (surrounding) includes
physical, chemical and biological components.
When a component surrounding an organism
affects the life of an organism, it becomes a
factor. All such factors together are called
environmental factors or ecological factors.
These factors can be classified into living
(biotic) and non-living (abiotic) which make
the environment of an organism. However the
ecological factors are meaningfully grouped
into four classes, which are as follows:

i. Climatic factors

ii. Edaphic factors

iii. Topographic factors

iv. Biotic factors

We will discuss the above factors in a concise
manner.

###### DO YOU KNOW? 


Flowers of poppy, chicory,
dog rose and many other
plants, blossom before the
break of dawn (4 – 5 am),
evening primrose open up with the onset
of dusk (5 – 6 pm) due to diurnal rhythm.

#### Climatic Factors </u>

Climate is one of the important natural factors
controlling the plant life. The climatic factors
includes light, temperature, water, wind and
fire.

**a. Light**

Light is a well known factor needed for the
basic physiological processes of plants, such as
photosynthesis, transpiration, seed germination
and flowering. The portion of the sunlight which
can be resolved by the human eye is called
**visible light.** The visible part of light is madeup of wavelength from about 400 nm (violet)
to 700 nm **(red)**. The rate of photosynthesis is
maximum at **blue** (400 – 500 nm) and red (600 –
700 nm). The **green**(500 – 600 nm) wave length
of spectrum is less strongly absorbed by plants.

**Effects of light on plants**


![Figure 6.2: Various effects of light upon a green plant](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic4.png )

Based on the tolerance to intensities of light,
the plants are divided into two types. They are 

1. Heliophytes - Light loving plants.
Example: Angiosperms.


2. Sciophytes - Shade loving plants.
Example: Bryophytes and Pteridophytes.

In deep sea (>500m), the environment is
dark and its inhabitants are not aware of the
existence of celestial source of energy called
Sun. What, then is their source of energy?

###### DO YOU KNOW? 

Palaeoclimatology–Helps to
reconstruct past climates of
our planet and flora, fauna
and ecosystem in which they
lived. Example: Air bubbles trapped in ice
for tens of thousands of years with fossilized
pollen, coral, plant and animal debris.

{{< /box >}}


**b. Temperature**

Temperature is one of the important factors
which affect almost all the metabolic activities
of an organism. Every physiological process in
an organism requires an optimum temperature
at which it shows the maximum metabolic rate.
Three limits of temperature can be recognized
for any organism. They are

1.**Minimum temperature**- Physiological
activities are lowest.

2. **Optimum temperature**- Physiological
activities are maximum.

3. **Maximum temperature** - Physiological
activities will stop.

Based on the temperature prevailing in
an area, **Raunkiaer** classified the world’s
vegetation into the following four types. They
are megatherms, mesotherms, microtherms
and hekistotherms. In thermal springs and deep
sea hydrothermal vents the average temperature
exceed 100<sup>o</sup>C.

Based on the range of **thermal tolerance,**
organisms are divided into two types.

**1. Eurythermal:** Organisms which can tolerate
a wide range of temperature fluctuations.
Example: Zostera (A marine Angiosperm) and
Artemisia tridentata.


**2. Stenothermal:** Organisms which can
tolerate only small range of temperature
variations. Example: Mango and Palm
(Terrestrial Angiosperms).

Mango plant does not grow in temperate
countries like Canada and Germany

#### <u>Thermal Stratification </u>

It is usually found in aquatic habitat. The
change in the temperature profile with
increasing depth in a water body is called
**thermal stratification**. There are three levels
of thermal stratifications.

![Figure 6.3: Thermal stratification of pond](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic5.png )

1. Epilimnion – The upper layer of warmer
water.

2. Metalimnion – The middle layer with a
zone of gradual decrease in temperature.

3. Hypolimnion - The bottom layer of colder water.

**Temperature based zonation**

Variations in **latitude** and **altitude** do affect the
temperature and the vegetation on the earth
surface. The latitudinal and altitudinal zonation
of vegetation is illustrated below:

**Latitude:** Latitude is an angle which ranges
from 00 at the equator to 900 at the poles.


**Altitude:** How high a place is located above
the sea level is called the altitude of the place.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic6.png )


**Timber line / Tree line :** It is an imaginary
line in a mountain or higher areas of land
that marks the level above which trees do
not grow. The altitudinal limit of normal tree
growth is about **3000 to 4000m.**

**Effects of temperature**

The following physiological processes are
influenced by temperature:

* Temperature affects the enzymatic action
of all the bio-chemical reactions in a plant
body.

* It influences CO2 and O2 solubility in the
biological systems. Increases respiration
and stimulates growth of seedlings.

* Low temperature with high humidity can
cause spread of diseases in plants.

* The varying temperature with moisture
determines the distribution of the
vegetation types.

**c. Water**


Water is one of the most important climatic
factors. It affects the vital processes of all living
organisms. It is believed that even life had
originated only in water during the evolution of
Earth. Water covers more than 70% of the earth’s
surface. In nature, water is available to plants in
three ways. They are **atmospheric moisture,**
**precipitation and soil water.**

{{< box title="Learning Objectives" type="objective" >}}

###### DO YOU KNOW? 

**Evergreen forests** – Found
where heavy rainfall occurs
throughout the year.

**Sclerophyllous forests** –
Found where heavy rainfall occurs during
winter and low rainfall during summer.

{{< /box >}}

The productivity and distribution of plants depend
upon the availability of water. Further the quality
of water is also important especially for the aquatic
organisms. The total amount of water salinity in
different water bodies are :i).5% in inland water
(Fresh water) ii).30 – 35% in sea water and iii).
More than 100% in hypersaline water **(Lagoons)**
Based on the range of tolerance of salinity,
organisms are divided into two types.

**1. Euryhaline:** Organisms which can live in
water with wide range of salinity. Examples:
Marine algae and marina angiosperms


**2. Stenohaline:** Organisms which can withstand 
only small range of salinity. Example: Plants of
estuaries.

![Table 6.2: Tolerance of Environmental factor](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic7.png )


**Examples of tolerance to toxicity**

i. Soyabean and tomato manage to tolerate
presence of cadmium poisoning by isolating
cadmium and storing into few group of cells
and prevent cadmium affecting other cells .
ii. Rice and Eichhornia (water hyacinth ) tolerate
cadmium by binding it to their proteins.

These plants otherwise can also be used to
remove cadmium from contaminated soil ,this
is known as **Phytoremediation.**

**d. Wind**


Air in motion is called wind. It is also a
vital ecological factor. The atmospheric air
contains a number of gases, particles and
other constituents. The composition of gases
in atmosphere is as follows: Nitrogen -78% ,
Oxygen -21%, Carbon-di-oxide -0.03%, Argon
and other gases - 0.93%. The other components
of wind are water vapour, gaseous pollutants,
dust, smoke particles, microorganisms,
pollen grains, spores, etc. **Anemometer** is the
instrument used to measure the speed of wind.

{{< box title="Learning Objectives" type="objective" >}}

###### DO YOU KNOW? 

**Green House Effect Albedo Effect**

Gases let out to atmosphere
causes climatic change.
Emission of dust and aerosols (small solids
or liquid particles in suspension in the
atmosphere) from industries, automobiles,
forest fire, So2 and DMS (dimethyl sulphur)
play an important role in disturbing the
temperature level of any region. Aerosols
with small particles is reflecting the
solar radiation entering the atmosphere.
This is known as **Albedo effect.** So it
reduces the temperature (cooling) limits,
photosynthesis and respiration. The
sulphur compounds are responsible for
**acid rain** due to acidification of rain water
and destroy the ozone.

{{< /box >}}

**Effects of wind**

*  Wind is an important factor for the
formation of rain

*  Causes wave formation in lakes and ocean,
promotes aeration of water

*  Strong wind causes soil erosion and reduces
soil fertility

*  Increases the rate of transpiration

* Helps in pollination in anemophilous plants

* It also helps in dispersal of many
fruits, seeds, spores, etc.


* Strong wind may cause up-rooting of big trees


*  Unidirectional wind stimulates the
development of flag forms in trees.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic8.png )

**e. Fire**

Fire is an exothermic factor caused due to the
chemical process of combustion, releasing heat
and light. It is mostly man-made and sometimes develops naturally due to the friction
between the tree surfaces. Fire is generally
divided into

1. Ground fire – Which is flameless and
subterranean.

2. Surface fire – Which consumes the herbs
and shrubs.

3. Crown fire – Which burns the forest canopy.
Effects of fire

* Fire has a dir ect lethal effect on plants

*  Burning scars are the suitable places for the
entry of parasitic fungi and insects

*  It brings out the alteration of light, rainfall,
nutrient cycle, fertility of soil, pH, soil flora
and fauna

*  Some fungi which grow in soil of burnt areas
called pyrophilous.
*Example: Pyronema confluens*

**Indicators of fire** – *Pteris* ( fern ) and
*Pyronema*(fungus) indicates the burnt up
and fire disturbed areas. So they are called
indicators of fire.


**Fire break**– It is a gap made in the vegetation
that acts as a barrier to slow down or stop the
progress of fire.


**A natural fire break**may occur when there
is a lack of vegetation such as River, lake and
canyon found in between vegetation may act
as a natural fire break.


**Rhytidome:** It is the structural defense by
plants against fire .The outer bark of trees
which extends to the last formed periderm is
called Rhytidome. It is composed of multiple
layers of suberized periderm, cortical and
phloem tissues. It protects the stem against
fire , water loss, invasion of insects and
prevents infections by microorganisms.




### Ecological adaptations

The modifications in the structure of
organisms to survive successfully in an
environment are called adaptations of
organisms. Adaptations help the organisms to
exist under the prevailing ecological habitat.
Based on the habitats and the corresponding
adaptations of plants, they are classified
as hydrophytes, xerophytes, mesophytes,
epiphytes and halophytes.

**Hydrophytes**

The plants which are living in water or wet
places are called hydrophytes. According to
their relation to water and air, they are sub-
divided into following categories: i) Free
floating hydrophytes, ii) Rooted- floating
hydrophytes, iii) Submerged floating
hydrophytes, iv) Rooted -submerged
hydrophytes, v) Amphibious hydrophytes.
i. Free floating hydrophytes: These plants
float freely on the surface of water. They
remain in contact with water and air, but not
with soil. Examples: Eichhornia, Pistia and
Wolffia (smallest flowering plant).
ii. Rooted floating hydrophytes: In these
plants, the roots are fixed in mud, but their
leaves and flowers are floating on the surface
of water. These plants are in contact with soil,
water and air. Examples: *Nelumbo, Nymphaea, Potomogeton and Marsilea.*

**Lotus seeds show highest longevity in plant kingdom.**

**iii. Submerged floating hydrophytes:** These
plants are completely submerged in water and
not in contact with soil and air. Examples:
*Ceratophyllum and Utricularia.*


**iv. Rooted- submerged hydrophytes:** These
plants are completely submerged in water
and rooted in soil and not in contact with air.
*Examples: Hydrilla, Vallisneria and Isoetes.*

**v. Amphibious hydrophytes** (Rooted emergent
hydrophytes): These plants are adapted to both

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic22.png )

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic23.png )

aquatic and terrestrial modes of life. They grow
in shallow water. Examples: Ranunculus, Typha
and Sagittaria.

**Hygrophytes:** The plants which can grow
in moist damp and shady places are called
hygrophytes. Examples: Habenaria (Orchid),
Mosses (Bryophytes), etc.

### Morphological adaptations of Hydrophytes:
**In root**

* Roots are totally absent in Wolffia and
Salvinia or poorly developed in Hydrilla or
well developed in *Ranunculus.*

* The root caps are replaced by root pockets.
*Example: Eichhornia*

**In stem**


* The stem is long, slender, spongy and flexible
in submerged forms.

*  In free floating forms the stem is thick, short
stoloniferous and spongy; and in rooted
floating forms, it is a rhizome .

* Vegetative propagation is through runners,
stolon, stem and root cuttings , tubers,
dormant apices and offsets.

**In leaves**

* The leaves are thin, long and ribbon shaped in
*Vallisneria* or long and linear in Potamogeton
or finely dissected in *Ceratophyllum*

* The floating leaves are large and flat as in
Nymphaea and Nelumbo. In Eichhornia and
Trapa petioles become swollen and spongy.

* In emergent forms, the leaves show
heterophylly (Submerged leaves are
dissected and aerial leaves are entire).

**Example:**
*Ranunculus,Limnophila , heterophylla and Sagittaria*

**Anatomical adaptations**

* Cuticle is either completely absent or if
present it is thin and poorly developed

* Single layer of epidermis is present

* Cortex is well developed with aerenchyma

*	Vascular tissues are poorly developed. In
emergent forms vascular elements are well
developed.

*	Mechanical tissues are generally absent
except in some emergent forms. Pith cells
are sclerenchymatous.

 **Physiological adaptations of Hydrophytes:**

* Hydrophytes have the ability to withstand
anaerobic conditions .
* They possess special aerating organs.

**Xerophytes**

The plants which are living in dry or xeric
condition are known as Xerophytes. Xerophytic
habitat can be of two different types. They are:

**a. Physical dryness:** In these habitats, soil has a
little amount of water due to the inability of the
soil to hold water because of low rainfall

**b. Physiological dryness:** In these habitats,
water is sufficiently present but plants are unable
to absorb it because of the absence of capillary
spaces. Example: Plants in salty and acidic soil.

Based on adaptive characters xerophytes
are classified into three categories. They are
Ephemerals, Succulents and Non succulent
plants.

**i. Ephemerals:**
These are also
called drought
escapers
or **drought evaders.**
These
plants
complete their
life cycle within
a short period
**(single season).**
These are not true xerophytes. Examples:
Argemone, Mollugo, Tribulus and Tephrosia.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic25.png )

**ii. Succulents:** These are also called drought
**enduring plants**. These plants store water in
their plant parts during the dry period. These
plants develop certain adaptive characters to
resist extreme drought conditions. Examples:
*Opuntia, Aloe, Bryophyllum and Begonia.*

**iii. Non succulents:** These are also called
**drought resistant plants ( true xerophytes).**
They face both external and internal dryness.
They have many adaptations to resist dry
conditions. 
*Examples: Casuarina, Nerium, Zizyphus and Acacia.*

**ii. Succulents:** These are also called drought
**enduring plants.**These plants store water in
their plant parts during the dry period. These
plants develop certain adaptive characters to
resist extreme drought conditions. 
*Examples: Opuntia, Aloe, Bryophyllum and Begonia.*

**iii. Non succulents:** These are also called
**drought resistant plants ( true xerophytes).**
They face both external and internal dryness.
They have many adaptations to resist dry
conditions. *Examples: Casuarina, Nerium,*
*Zizyphus and Acacia.*

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic26.png )

**Morphological Adaptations**

**In root**

* Root system is well developed and is greater
than that of shoot system.

* Root hairs and root caps are also well developed.

In xerophytic plants with the leaves and
stem are covered with hairs are called
**trichophyllous plants**. Example: Cucurbits
(Melothria and Mukia )

**In stem**

* Stems are mostly hard and woody. They may
be aerial or underground

* The stems and leaves are covered with wax
coating or covered with dense hairs.

* In some xerophytes all the internodes in the
stem are modified into a fleshy leaf structure
called **phylloclades (Opuntia)** .

* In some of the others single or occasionally
two internodes modified into fleshy green
structure called **cladode** (Asparagus).
In some the petiole is modified into a fleshy
leaf like structurcalled phyllode (Acacia
melanoxylon)..

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic27.png )


a) A succulent xerophyte: Phylloclade – opuntia

b) Non succulent: Perennial - Capparis

c) Cladode of Asparagus

d) Phyllode – Acacia

In leaves

* Leaves are generally leathery and shiny to
reflect light and heat.

* In some plants like Euphorbia, Acacia,
Ziziphus and Capparis, the stipules are
modified into spines.

* The entire leaves are modified into spines
(Opuntia ) or reduced to scales (Asparagus).


**Anatomical adaptations**


* Presence of multilayered epidermis with
heavy cuticle to prevent water loss due to
transpiration.

* Hypodermis is well developed with
sclerenchymatous tissues.

* Sunken stomata are present only in the lower
epidermis with hairs in the sunken pits.


* Scotoactive type of stomata found in
succulent plants .

* Vascular bundles are well developed with
several layered bundle sheath.

* Mesophyll is well differentiated into
palisade and spongy parenchyma.

* In succulents the stem possesses a water
storage region.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic28.png )

**Physiological adaptations**

* Most of the physiological processes are
designed to reduce transpiration.

* Life cycle is completed within a short
period (Ephemerals).


### Mesophytes

The plants which are living in moderate
conditions (neither too wet nor too dry) are
known as **mesophytes**. These are common land
plants. Example: Maize and Hibiscus.

**Morphological adaptations**

* Root system is well developed with root
caps and root hairs

* Stems are generally aerial, stout and highly
branched.

* Leaves are generally large, broad, thin with
different shapes.


### Anatomical adaptations

* Cuticle in aerial parts are moderately
developed.

* Epidermis is well developed and stomata are
generally present on both the epidermis.

* Mesophyll is well differentiated into palisade
and spongy parenchyma.

* Vascular and mechanical tissues are fairly
developed and well differentiated.


**Physiological adaptations**

* All physiological processes are normal.

* Temporary wilting takes place at room
temperature when there is water scarcity.

**Tropophytes** are plants which behave
as xerophytes at summer and behave as
mesophytes (or) hydrophytes during rainy
season.

**Epiphytes**

Epiphytes are plants which grow perched on
other plants (Supporting plants). They use
the supporting plants only as shelter and not
for water or food supply. These epiphytes
are commonly seen in tropical rain forests.
Examples: Orchids, Lianas, Hanging Mosses
and Money plant.

**Morphological adaptations**

* Root system is extensively developed. These
roots may be of two types. They are Clinging
roots and Aerial roots.

* **Clinging roots** fix the epiphytes firmly on
the surface of the supporting objects.

**Aerial roots** are green coloured roots which
may hang downwardly and absorb moisture
from the atmosphere with the help of a
spongy tissue called **velamen**

* Stem of some epiphytes are succulent and
develop pseudobulb or tuber.

* Generally the leaves are lesser in number
and may be fleshy and leathery

* Myrmecophily is a common occurrence
in the epiphytic vegetation to prevent the
predators.

* The fruits and seeds are very small and
usually dispersed by wind, insects and birds.

### Anatomical adaptations

* Multilayered epidermis is present. Inner to
the velamen tissue, the peculiar exodermis
layer is present.

* Presence of thick cuticle and sunken stomata
greatly reduces transpiration.

* Succulent epiphytes contain well developed
parenchymatous cells to store water.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic29.png )


**Physiological adaptations**

Special absorption processes of water by
velamen tissue .

**Halophytes**

There are special type of Halophytic plants
which grow on soils with high concentration
of salts. Examples: *Rhizophora, Sonneratia and*
*Avicennia.*

Halophytes are usually found near the sea-
shores and Estuaries. The soils are physically
wet but physiologically dry. As plants cannot use
salt water directly they require filtration of salt
using physiological processes. This vegetation is
also known as **mangrove forest** and the plants
are called **mangroves.**

**Morphological adaptations**

* The temperate halophytes are herbaceous
but the tropical halophytes are mostly bushy

* In addition to the normal roots, many stilt
roots are developed

* A special type of negatively geotropic
roots called **pneumatophores** with
pneumathodes to get sufficient aeration
are also present. They are called breathing
roots. *Example: Avicennia*

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic30.png )


![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic31.png )

### Anatomical adaptations

* Epidermal cells of stem is heavy cutinized,
almost squarish and are filled with oil and
tannins.

* **‘Star’ shaped sclereids and ‘H’ shaped** heavy
thickened spicules that provide mechanical
strength to cortex are present in the stem.

* The leaves may be dorsiventral or isobilateral
with **salt secreting glands.**


### Physiological adaptations


* High osmotic pressure exists in some
plants .

* Seeds germinate in the fruits while on the
mother plant (Vivipary).

**DO YOU KNOW**

Out of three districts of Tamil
Nadu (Nagapattinam, Thanjavur
and Thiruvarur), Muthupet
(Thiruvarur district) was less damaged by
Gaja cyclone ( November 2018) due to the
presence of mangrove forest.

### Dispersal of Fruits and Seeds

Both fruits and seeds possess attractive colour,
odour, shape and taste needed for the dispersal
by birds, mammals, reptiles, fish, ants and
insects even earthworms. The seed consists
of an embryo, stored food material and a
protective covering called seed coat. As seeds
contain miniature but dormant future plants,
their dispersal is an important criterion for
distribution and establishment of plants over
a wide geographical area. The dissemination of
seeds and fruits to various distances from the
parent plant is called seed and fruit dispersal.
It takes place with the help of ecological factors
such as wind, water and animals.

Seed dispersal is a regeneration process
of plant populations and a common means of
colonizing new areas to avoid seedling level
competition and from natural enemies like
herbivores, frugivores and pathogens.

Fruit maturation and seed dispersal is
influenced by many ecologically favourable
conditions such as Season (Example: Summer),
suitable environment, and seasonal availability
of dispersal agents like birds, insects etc.


Seeds require agents for dispersal which
are crucial in plant community dynamics in
many ecosystems around the globe. They offer
many benefits to communities such as food and
nutrients, migration of seeds across habitats
and helps spreading plant genetic diversity.

#### Dispersal by Wind (Anemochory)

The individual seeds or the whole fruit may be
modified to help for the dispersal by wind. Wind
dispersal of fruits and seeds is quite common in
tall trees. The adaptation of the wind dispersed
plants are

*  Minute seeds: Seeds are minute, very
small, light and with inflated covering.
*Example: Orchids.*

* Wings: Seeds or whole fruits are flattened to
form a wing. Examples: Maple, Gyrocarpus,
*Dipterocarpus and Terminalia*

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic32.png )



* Feathery Appendages: Seeds or fruits may
have feathery appendages which greatly
increase their buoyancy to disperse to high
altitudes. Examples: Vernonia and Asclepias.

* C ensor mechanisms: The fruits of many
plants open in such a way that the seeds
can escape only when the fruit is violently
shaken by a strong wind. Examples:
Aristolochia and Poppy.


Guess!! Who am I…….? I am dispersed by
ant and I have caruncle.
