Both fruits and seeds possess attractive colour,
odour, shape and taste needed for the dispersal
by birds, mammals, reptiles, fish, ants and
insects even earthworms. The seed consists
of an embryo, stored food material and a
protective covering called seed coat. As seeds
contain miniature but dormant future plants,
their dispersal is an important criterion for
distribution and establishment of plants over
a wide geographical area. The dissemination of
seeds and fruits to various distances from the
parent plant is called seed and fruit dispersal.
It takes place with the help of ecological factors
such as wind, water and animals.

Seed dispersal is a regeneration process
of plant populations and a common means of
colonizing new areas to avoid seedling level
competition and from natural enemies like
herbivores, frugivores and pathogens.


Fruit maturation and seed dispersal is
influenced by many ecologically favourable
conditions such as Season (Example: Summer),
suitable environment, and seasonal availability
of dispersal agents like birds, insects etc.

Seeds require agents for dispersal which
are crucial in plant community dynamics in
many ecosystems around the globe. They offer
many benefits to communities such as food and
nutrients, migration of seeds across habitats
and helps spreading plant genetic diversity.

#### Dispersal by Wind (Anemochory)

The individual seeds or the whole fruit may be
modified to help for the dispersal by wind. Wind
dispersal of fruits and seeds is quite common in
tall trees. The adaptation of the wind dispersed
plants are

* Minute seeds: Seeds are minute, very
small, light and with inflated covering.
Example: Orchids.


* Wings: Seeds or whole fruits are flattened to
form a wing. Examples: Maple, Gyrocarpus,
Dipterocarpus and Terminalia

* Feathery Appendages: Seeds or fruits may
have feathery appendages which greatly
increase their buoyancy to disperse to high
altitudes. Examples: Vernonia and Asclepias.


* C ensor mechanisms: The fruits of many
plants open in such a way that the seeds
can escape only when the fruit is violently
shaken by a strong wind. Examples:
Aristolochia and Poppy.


Guess!! Who am I…….? I am dispersed by
ant and I have caruncle.


#### Dispersal by Water (Hydrochory)

Dispersal of seeds and fruits by water usually
occurs in those plants which grow in or near
water bodies . Adaptation of hydrochory are


*  Obconical receptacle with prominent air
spaces. Example: Nelumbo.

* Presence of fibrous mesocarp and light
pericarp. Example: Coconut.

* Seeds are light, small, provided with aril
which encloses air.Example: Nymphaea.

* The fruit may be inflated. Examples:
Heritiera littoralis.

* Seeds by themselves would not float may be
carried by water current. Example: Coconut.

#### Dispersal by Animals (Zoochory)

Birds and mammals, including human beings
play an efficient and important role in the
dispersal of fruit and seeds. They have the
following devices.

**i. Hooked fruit:** The surface of the fruit or seeds
have hooks,(Xanthium), barbs (Andropogon),
spines (Aristida) by means of which they adhere
to the body of animals or clothes of human
beings and get dispersed.

**ii. Sticky fruits and seeds:**

**a.** Some fruits have sticky glandular hairs by
which they adhere to the fur of grazing animals.
**Example: Boerhaavia and Cleome.**

**b.** Some fruits have viscid layer which adhere to
the beak of the bird which eat them and when
they rub them on to the branch of the tree, they
disperse and germinate. 
*Example: Cordia and Alangium*

**iii.** Fleshy fruits: Some fleshy fruits with
conspicuous colours are dispersed by human
beings to distant places after consumption.
*Example: Mango and Diplocyclos*

#### Dispersal by Explosive Mechanism (Autochory)

Some fruits burst suddenly with a force
enabling to throw seeds to a little distance away
from the plant. Autochory shows the following
adaptations.

* 	Mere touch of some plants causes the
ripened fruit to explode suddenly and seeds
are thrown out with great force. Example:
Impatiens (Balsam), Hura.

* Some fruits when they come in contact with
water particularly after a shower of rain,
burst suddenly with a noise and scatter the
seeds.Examples: Ruellia and Crossandra.

* Certain long pods explode with a loud
noise like cracker, scattering the seeds in
all directions. Example: Bauhinia vahlii
(Camel’s foot climber)

* As the fruit matures, tissues around seeds are
converted into a mucilaginous fluid, due to
which a high turgor pressure develops inside
the fruit which leads to the dispersal of seeds.

Example: *Ecballium elatrium* (Squirting cucumber) Gyrocarpus and Dipterocarpus.

### Human aided seed dispersal

**Seed Ball:** Seed ball
is an ancient Japanese
technique of encasing
seeds in a mixture of
clay and soil humus
(also in cow dung) and
scattering them on to
suitable ground, not planting of trees manually.
This method is suitable for barren and degraded
lands for tree regeneration and vegetation before
monsoon period where the suitable dispersal
agents become rare.

**Advantages of seed dispersal:**

Seeds escape from mortality near the
* parent plants due to predation by animals
or getting diseases and also avoiding
competition.

* Dispersal also gives a chance to occupy
favourable sites for growth.

* It is an important process in the movement
of plant genes particularly this is the only
method available for self-fertilized flowers
and maternally transmitted genes in
outcrossing plants.

* Seed dispersal by animals help in
conservation of many species even in
human altered ecosystems.

* Understanding of fruits and seed dispersal
acts as a key for proper functioning and
establishment of many ecosystems from
deserts to evergreen forests and also for the
maintenance of biodiversity conservation
and restoration of ecosystems.

**Summary**

Ecology is a division of biology and deals
with the study of environment in relation to
organisms. Ecology is mainly divided into
two branches Autecology and Synecology. The
environment (surrounding) includes physical,
chemical and biological components. These
factors can be classified into living (biotic)
and non-living (abiotic), which make the
environment of an organism. The ecological
factors are meaningfully grouped into four
classes, which are as follows: 1. Climatic factors
2. Edaphic factors 3. Topographic factors 4.
Biotic factors.

Climate is one of the important natural
factors controlling the plant life. The climatic
factors includes light, temperature, water,
wind, fire, etc. Edaphic factors, the abiotic
factors related to soil, include the physical and
chemical composition of the soil formed in a
particular area. The surface features of earth
are called topography. Topographic influence
on the climate of any area is determined by
the interaction of solar radiation, temperature,
humidity ,rainfall, latitude and altitude. The
interactions among living organisms, the plants
and animals are called biotic factors, which may
cause marked effects upon vegetation.

The modifications in the structure of
organisms to survive successfully in an
environment are called adaptations of
organisms. Based on the habitats and the
corresponding adaptations of plants, they are
classified into 1) Hydrophytes 2) Xerophytes
3) Mesophytes 4) Epiphytes and 5) Halophytes.

The dissemination of seeds and fruits to various
distances from the parent plant is called **seed and fruit dispersal**. It takes place with the help
of ecological factors such as wind, water and
animals.
