The modifications in the structure of
organisms to survive successfully in an
environment are called **adaptations** of
organisms. Adaptations help the organisms to
exist under the prevailing ecological habitat.
Based on the habitats and the corresponding
adaptations of plants, they are classified
as hydrophytes, xerophytes, mesophytes,
epiphytes and halophytes.

**Hydrophytes**

The plants which are living in water or wet
places are called hydrophytes. According to
their relation to water and air, they are sub-
divided into following categories: i) Free
floating hydrophytes, ii) Rooted- floating
hydrophytes, iii) Submerged floating
hydrophytes, iv) Rooted -submerged
hydrophytes, v) Amphibious hydrophytes.

**i. Free floating hydrophytes:** These plants
float freely on the surface of water. They
remain in contact with water and air, but not
with soil. Examples: Eichhornia, Pistia and
Wolffia (smallest flowering plant).


**ii. Rooted floating hydrophytes:** In these
plants, the roots are fixed in mud, but their
leaves and flowers are floating on the surface
of water. These plants are in contact with soil,
water and air. Examples: *Nelumbo, Nymphaea, Potomogeton and Marsilea.*

**Lotus seeds show highest longevity in plant kingdom.**

**iii. Submerged floating hydrophytes:** These
plants are completely submerged in water and
not in contact with soil and air. Examples:
*Ceratophyllum and Utricularia.*


**iv. Rooted- submerged hydrophytes:** These
plants are completely submerged in water
and rooted in soil and not in contact with air.
*Examples: Hydrilla, Vallisneria and Isoetes.*

**v. Amphibious hydrophytes** (Rooted emergent
hydrophytes): These plants are adapted to both

aquatic and terrestrial modes of life. They grow
in shallow water. Examples: Ranunculus, Typha
and Sagittaria.

**Hygrophytes:** The plants which can grow
in moist damp and shady places are called
hygrophytes. Examples: Habenaria (Orchid),
Mosses (Bryophytes), etc.

### Morphological adaptations of Hydrophytes:
**In root**

* Roots are totally absent in Wolffia and
Salvinia or poorly developed in Hydrilla or
well developed in *Ranunculus.*

* The root caps are replaced by root pockets.
*Example: Eichhornia*

**In stem**


* The stem is long, slender, spongy and flexible
in submerged forms.

*  In free floating forms the stem is thick, short
stoloniferous and spongy; and in rooted
floating forms, it is a rhizome .

* Vegetative propagation is through runners,
stolon, stem and root cuttings , tubers,
dormant apices and offsets.

**In leaves**

* The leaves are thin, long and ribbon shaped in
*Vallisneria* or long and linear in Potamogeton
or finely dissected in *Ceratophyllum*

* The floating leaves are large and flat as in
Nymphaea and Nelumbo. In Eichhornia and
Trapa petioles become swollen and spongy.

* In emergent forms, the leaves show
heterophylly (Submerged leaves are
dissected and aerial leaves are entire).

**Example:**
*Ranunculus,Limnophila , heterophylla and Sagittaria*

**Anatomical adaptations**

* Cuticle is either completely absent or if
present it is thin and poorly developed

* Single layer of epidermis is present

* Cortex is well developed with aerenchyma

*	Vascular tissues are poorly developed. In
emergent forms vascular elements are well
developed.

*	Mechanical tissues are generally absent
except in some emergent forms. Pith cells
are sclerenchymatous.

 **Physiological adaptations of Hydrophytes:**

* Hydrophytes have the ability to withstand
anaerobic conditions .
* They possess special aerating organs.

**Xerophytes**

The plants which are living in dry or xeric
condition are known as Xerophytes. Xerophytic
habitat can be of two different types. They are:

**a. Physical dryness:** In these habitats, soil has a
little amount of water due to the inability of the
soil to hold water because of low rainfall

**b. Physiological dryness:** In these habitats,
water is sufficiently present but plants are unable
to absorb it because of the absence of capillary
spaces. Example: Plants in salty and acidic soil.

Based on adaptive characters xerophytes
are classified into three categories. They are
Ephemerals, Succulents and Non succulent
plants.

**i. Ephemerals:**
These are also
called **drought escapers**
or **drought evaders.**
These
plants
complete their
life cycle within
a short period
**(single season).**
These are not true xerophytes. Examples:
*Argemone, Mollugo, Tribulus and Tephrosia.*

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic25.png )

**ii. Succulents:** These are also called drought
**enduring plants**. These plants store water in
their plant parts during the dry period. These
plants develop certain adaptive characters to
resist extreme drought conditions. Examples:
*Opuntia, Aloe, Bryophyllum and Begonia.*

**iii. Non succulents:** These are also called
**drought resistant plants ( true xerophytes).**
They face both external and internal dryness.
They have many adaptations to resist dry
conditions. 
*Examples: Casuarina, Nerium, Zizyphus and Acacia.*

**ii. Succulents:** These are also called drought
**enduring plants.**These plants store water in
their plant parts during the dry period. These
plants develop certain adaptive characters to
resist extreme drought conditions. 
*Examples: Opuntia, Aloe, Bryophyllum and Begonia.*

**iii. Non succulents:** These are also called
**drought resistant plants ( true xerophytes).**
They face both external and internal dryness.
They have many adaptations to resist dry
conditions. *Examples: Casuarina, Nerium,*
*Zizyphus and Acacia.*

**Morphological Adaptations**

**In root**

* Root system is well developed and is greater
than that of shoot system.

* Root hairs and root caps are also well developed.

In xerophytic plants with the leaves and
stem are covered with hairs are called
**trichophyllous plants**. Example: Cucurbits
(Melothria and Mukia )

**In stem**

* Stems are mostly hard and woody. They may
be aerial or underground

* The stems and leaves are covered with wax
coating or covered with dense hairs.

* In some xerophytes all the internodes in the
stem are modified into a fleshy leaf structure
called **phylloclades (Opuntia)** .

* In some of the others single or occasionally
two internodes modified into fleshy green
structure called **cladode** (Asparagus).
In some the petiole is modified into a fleshy
leaf like structurcalled phyllode (Acacia
melanoxylon)..

a) A succulent xerophyte: Phylloclade – opuntia

b) Non succulent: Perennial - Capparis

c) Cladode of Asparagus

d) Phyllode – Acacia

In leaves

* Leaves are generally leathery and shiny to
reflect light and heat.

* In some plants like Euphorbia, Acacia,
Ziziphus and Capparis, the stipules are
modified into spines.

* The entire leaves are modified into spines
(Opuntia ) or reduced to scales (Asparagus).


**Anatomical adaptations**


* Presence of multilayered epidermis with
heavy cuticle to prevent water loss due to
transpiration.

* Hypodermis is well developed with
sclerenchymatous tissues.

* Sunken stomata are present only in the lower
epidermis with hairs in the sunken pits.


* Scotoactive type of stomata found in
succulent plants .

* Vascular bundles are well developed with
several layered bundle sheath.

* Mesophyll is well differentiated into
palisade and spongy parenchyma.

* In succulents the stem possesses a water
storage region.

**Physiological adaptations**

* Most of the physiological processes are
designed to reduce transpiration.

* Life cycle is completed within a short
period (Ephemerals).


### Mesophytes

The plants which are living in moderate
conditions (neither too wet nor too dry) are
known as **mesophytes**. These are common land
plants. Example: Maize and Hibiscus.

**Morphological adaptations**

* Root system is well developed with root
caps and root hairs

* Stems are generally aerial, stout and highly
branched.

* Leaves are generally large, broad, thin with
different shapes.


### Anatomical adaptations

* Cuticle in aerial parts are moderately
developed.

* Epidermis is well developed and stomata are
generally present on both the epidermis.

* Mesophyll is well differentiated into palisade
and spongy parenchyma.

* Vascular and mechanical tissues are fairly
developed and well differentiated.


**Physiological adaptations**

* All physiological processes are normal.

* Temporary wilting takes place at room
temperature when there is water scarcity.

**Tropophytes** are plants which behave
as xerophytes at summer and behave as
mesophytes (or) hydrophytes during rainy
season.

**Epiphytes**

Epiphytes are plants which grow perched on
other plants (Supporting plants). They use
the supporting plants only as shelter and not
for water or food supply. These epiphytes
are commonly seen in tropical rain forests.
Examples: Orchids, Lianas, Hanging Mosses
and Money plant.

**Morphological adaptations**

* Root system is extensively developed. These
roots may be of two types. They are Clinging
roots and Aerial roots.

* **Clinging roots** fix the epiphytes firmly on
the surface of the supporting objects.

**Aerial roots** are green coloured roots which
may hang downwardly and absorb moisture
from the atmosphere with the help of a
spongy tissue called **velamen**

* Stem of some epiphytes are succulent and
develop pseudobulb or tuber.

* Generally the leaves are lesser in number
and may be fleshy and leathery

* Myrmecophily is a common occurrence
in the epiphytic vegetation to prevent the
predators.

* The fruits and seeds are very small and
usually dispersed by wind, insects and birds.

### Anatomical adaptations

* Multilayered epidermis is present. Inner to
the velamen tissue, the peculiar exodermis
layer is present.

* Presence of thick cuticle and sunken stomata
greatly reduces transpiration.

* Succulent epiphytes contain well developed
parenchymatous cells to store water.

**Physiological adaptations**

Special absorption processes of water by
velamen tissue .

**Halophytes**

There are special type of Halophytic plants
which grow on soils with high concentration
of salts. Examples: *Rhizophora, Sonneratia and*
*Avicennia.*

Halophytes are usually found near the sea-
shores and Estuaries. The soils are physically
wet but physiologically dry. As plants cannot use
salt water directly they require filtration of salt
using physiological processes. This vegetation is
also known as **mangrove forest** and the plants
are called **mangroves.**

**Morphological adaptations**

* The temperate halophytes are herbaceous
but the tropical halophytes are mostly bushy

* In addition to the normal roots, many stilt
roots are developed

* A special type of negatively geotropic
roots called **pneumatophores** with
pneumathodes to get sufficient aeration
are also present. They are called breathing
roots. *Example: Avicennia*

### Anatomical adaptations

* Epidermal cells of stem is heavy cutinized,
almost squarish and are filled with oil and
tannins.

* **‘Star’ shaped sclereids and ‘H’ shaped** heavy
thickened spicules that provide mechanical
strength to cortex are present in the stem.

* The leaves may be dorsiventral or isobilateral
with **salt secreting glands.**


### Physiological adaptations


* High osmotic pressure exists in some
plants .

* Seeds germinate in the fruits while on the
mother plant (Vivipary).

Out of three districts of Tamil
Nadu (Nagapattinam, Thanjavur
and Thiruvarur), Muthupet
(Thiruvarur district) was less damaged by
Gaja cyclone ( November 2018) due to the
presence of mangrove forest.
