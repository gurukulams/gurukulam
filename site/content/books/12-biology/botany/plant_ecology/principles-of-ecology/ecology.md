The term “ecology”
**(oekologie)** is derived from
two Greek words – **oikos**
(meaning house or dwelling
place and **logos** meaning
study) It was first proposed by
Reiter (1868). However, the
most widely accepted definition of ecology was
given by **Ernest Haeckel** (1869). 

**Alexander von Humbolt** - Father of Ecology

**Eugene P. Odum** - Father of modern Ecology

**R. Misra** - Father of Indian Ecology




#### Definitions of ecology 

> “The study of living organisms, both plants and animals, in their natural habitats or homes.” **- Reiter (1885)**

> “Ecology is the study of the reciprocal relationship between living organisms and their environment.” **- Earnest Haeckel (1889)**


#### Ecological hierarchy 

The interaction of organisms with their
environment results in the establishment of
grouping of organisms which is called ecological
hierarchy or ecological levels of organization.
The basic unit of ecological hierarchy is an
individual organism. The hierarchy of ecological
systems is illustrated below:

#### Branches of Ecology: 

Ecology is mainly divided into two branches,
they are autecology and synecology

**1. Autecology** is the ecology of an individual
species and is also called species ecology.

**2. Synecology** is the ecology of a population or
community with one or more species and also
called as community ecology.

Many advances and developments in the field
ecology resulted in various new dimensions
and branches. Some of the advanced fields are
Molecular ecology, Eco technology, Statistical
ecology and Environmental toxicology

#### Habitat and Niche 

**Habitat**

Habitat is a specific physical place or locality
occupied by an organism or any species which
has a particular combination of abiotic or
environmental factors. But the environment of
any community is called **Biotope.**

**Niche**

An ecological niche refers to an organism’s place
in the biotic environment and its functional
role in an ecosystem. The term was coined by
the naturalist **Roswell Hill Johnson but Grinell**
(1917) was probably first to use this term. The 
habitat and niche of any organism is called
**Ecotope**

**The differences between habitat and niche are as follows.**

**<u>Applied ecology or environmental technology :**

Application of the
Science of ecology is
otherwise called as **Applied ecology** or
**Environmental technology.** It helps us to
manage and conserve natural resources,
particularly ecosystems, forest and wild
life conservative and management.
Environmental management involves
Bio-diversity conservation, Ecosystem
restoration, Habitat management,
Invasive species management, Protected
areas management and also help us plan
landscapes and environmental impact
designing for the futuristic ecology.

#### Ecological equivalents 

Taxonomically different species occupying
similar habitats (Niches) in different geographical
regions are called **Ecological equivalents.**

**Examples:**

* Certain species of epiphytic orchids of
Western Ghats of India differ from the
epiphytic orchids of South America. But
they are epiphytes.

* Species of the grass lands of Western Ghats
of India differ from the grass species of
temperate grass lands of Steppe in North
America. But they are all ecologically
primary producers and fulfilling similar
roles in their respective communities.
