In the previous chapter you have learned
about Mendelian genetics, now you are going to
be study with deviations of concepts related to
Mendelian genetics and chromosomal theory
of inheritance. You must recall the structure of
chromosome and cell division from eleventh
standard.

**3.1 Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance**

G. J. Mendel (1865) studied the
inheritance of well-defined characters of
pea plant but for several reasons it was unrecognized till 1900. Three scientists
(de Vries, Correns and Tschermak)
independently rediscovered Mendel’s results
on the inheritance of characters. Various
cytologists also observed cell division due
to advancements in microscopy. This led to
the discovery of structures inside nucleus.
In eukaryotic cells, worm-shaped structures
formed during cell division are called
chromosomes (colored bodies, visualized
by staining). An organism which possesses
two complete basic sets of chromosomes are
known as diploid. A chromosome consists
of long, continuous coiled piece of DNA in
which genes are arranged in linear order.
Each gene has a definite position (locus) on
a chromosome. These genes are hereditary
units. Chromosomal theory of inheritance
states that Mendelian factors (genes) have
specific locus (position) on chromosomes and
they carry information from one generation
to the next generation.

**3.1.1 Historical development of chromosome theory**

The important cytological findings related
to the chromosome theory of inheritance are
given below.

Wilhelm Roux (1883) postulated that the
chromosomes of a cell are responsible for
transferring heredity.

Montgomery(1901) was first to suggest occurrence of distinct pairs of
chromosomes and he also concluded that
maternal chromosomes pair with paternal
chromosomes only during meiosis.


T.Boveri (1902) supported the
idea that the chromosomes contain
genetic determiners, and he was
largely responsible for developing the
chromosomal theory of inheritance.


W.S. Sutton (1902), a young American
student independently recognized a
parallelism (similarity) between the
behaviour of chromosomes and Mendelian
factors during gamete formation.
Sutton and Boveri (1903) independently
proposed the chromosome theory of
inheritance. Sutton united the knowledge of
chromosomal segregation with Mendelian
principles and called it chromosomal theory
of inheritance

**3..1.2 Salient features of the Chromosomal theory of inheritance**

Somatic cells of organisms are derived
from the zygote by repeated cell division
(mitosis). These consist of two identical
sets of chromosomes. One set is received
from female parent (maternal) and
the other from male parent (paternal).
These two chromosomes constitute the
homologous pair.

Chromosomes retain their structural
uniqueness and individuality throughout
the life cycle of an organism.

E ach chromosome carries specific
determiners or Mendelian factors which
are now termed as genes.

The behaviour of chromosomes during
the gamete formation (meiosis) provides
evidence to the fact that genes or factors
are located on chromosomes.

**3.1.4 Comparison between gene and chromosome behaviour**

Around twentieth century cytologists established that, generally the total number of
chromosomes is constant in all cells of a species.
A diploid eukaryotic cell has two haploid sets
of chromosomes, one set from each parent.
All somatic cells of an organism carry the same genetic complement. The behaviour of
chromosomes during meiosis not only explains
Mendel’s principles but leads to new and
different approaches to study about heredity.

Table 3.2 : Number of Chromosomes


{{< box title=" DID YOU KNOW" type="objective">}}
Fossil Genes: Some of the
junk DNA is made up of pseudo
genes, the sequences presence in
that was once working genes. They lost their
ability to make proteins. They tell the story of
evolution through fossilized parts.
{{< /box >}}

**3.2 Linkage**

The genes which determine the character of
an individual are carried by the chromosomes.
The genes for different characters may be
present either in the same chromosome or in
different chromosomes. When the genes are
present in different chromosomes, they assort
independently according to Mendel’s Law of
Independent Assortment. Biologists came
across certain genetic characteristics that did
not assort out independently in other organisms
after Mendel’s work. One such case was reported
in Sweet pea (Lathyrus odoratus) by William
Bateson and Reginald C. Punnet in 1906.
They crossed one homozygous strain of sweet
peas having purple flowers and long pollen
grains with another homozygous strain having
red flowers and round pollen grains. All the
F<sub>1</sub>  progenies had purple flower and long pollen
grains indicating purple flower long pollen
(PL/PL) was dominant over red flower round
pollen (pl/pl). When they crossed the F<sub>1</sub>  with
double recessive parent (test cross) in results,F<sub>2</sub>  progenies did not exhibit in 1:1:1:1 ratio as expected with independent assortment. A
greater number of F<sub>2</sub> plants had purple flowers
and long pollen or red flowers and round
pollen. So they concluded that genes for purple
colour and long pollen grain and the genes for
red colour and round pollen grain were found
close together in the same homologous pair
of chromosomes. These genes do not allow
themselves to be separated. So they do not
assort independently. This type of tendency
of genes to stay together during separation of
chromosomes is called Linkage.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.24.png )

Genes located close together on the
same chromosome and inherited together are
called linked genes. But the two genes that are
sufficiently far apart on the same chromosome are
called unlinked genes or syntenic genes (Figure
3.3). Such condition is known as synteny. It is to
be differentiated by the value of recombination
frequency. If the recombination frequency value
is more than 50 % the two genes show unlinked.
when the recombination frequency value is less
than 50 %, they show linked. Closely located
genes show strong linkage, while genes widely
located show weak linkages.

**3.2.1 Coupling and Repulsion theory**

The two dominant alleles or recessive alleles
occur in the same homologous chromosomes,
tend to inherit together into same gamete are
called coupling or cis configuration (Figure:
3.5 ). If dominant or recessive alleles are present
on two different, but homologous chromosomes
they inherit apart into different gamete are called

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.25.png )


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.26.png )

**3.2.2 Kinds of Linkage**

T.H. Morgan found two types of linkage. They
are complete linkage and incomplete linkage
depending upon the absence or presence of
new combination of linked genes.

**Complete Linkage**

If the chances of separation of two linked
genes are not possible those genes always remain
together as a result, only parental combinations are observed. The linked genes are located
very close together on the same chromosome
such genes do not exhibit crossing over. This
phenomenon is called complete linkage. It is
rare but has been reported in male Drosophila.
C.B Bridges (1919) discovered that crossing
over is completely absent in some species of
male Drosophila.
Incomplete Linkage
If two linked genes are sufficiently apart,
the chances of their separation are possible. As a
result, parental and non-parental combinations
are observed. The linked genes exhibit some
crossing over. This phenomenon is called
incomplete linkage. This was observed in
maize. It was reported by Hutchinson.

**3.2.3 Linkage Groups**

The groups of linearly arranged linked genes
on a chromosome are called Linkage groups.
In any species the number of linkage groups
corresponds to the number haploid set of chromosomes. Example:

Table 3.4:Differences between linkage and
crossing over

**3.3 Crossing Over**

Crossing over is a biological process that
produces new combination of genes by inter-
changing the corresponding segments between
non-sister chromatids of homologous pair of
chromosomes. The term 'crossing over' was
coined by Morgan (1912). It takes place during
pachytene stage of prophase I of meiosis. Usually
crossing over occurs in germinal cells during
gametogenesis. It is called meiotic or germinal
crossing over. It has universal occurrence and
has great significance. Rarely, crossing over
occurs in somatic cells during mitosis. It is
called somatic or mitotic crossing over.

**3.3.1 Mechanism of Crossing Over**

Crossing over is a precise process that includes
stages like synapsis, tetrad formation, cross over
and terminalization.

(i) Synapsis
Intimate pairing between two homologous
chromosomes is initiated during zygotene
stage of prophase I of meiosis I. Homologous
chromosomes are aligned side by side resulting
in a pair of homologous chromosomes called
bivalents. This pairing phenomenon is called
synapsis or syndesis. It is of three types,

1.Procentric synapsis: Pairing starts from
middle of the chromosome.

2.Proterminal synapsis: Pairing starts from
the telomeres.

3.R andom synapsis: Pairing may start from
anywhere.

(ii) Tetrad Formation Each homologous chromosome of a bivalent begin to form two identical sister chromatids, which remain held together by a centromere. At this stage each bivalent has fourchromatids. This stage is called tetrad stage.

(iii) Cross Over After tetrad formation, crossing over occurs in
pachytene stage. The non-sister chromatids of
homologous pair make a contact at one or more
points. These points of contact between non-
sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes
are called Chiasmata (singular-Chiasma). At
chiasma, cross-shaped or X-shaped structures
are formed, where breaking and rejoining of
two chromatids occur. This results in reciprocal
exchange of equal and corresponding segments

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.27.png )

(iv) Terminalisation
After crossing over, chiasma starts to move
towards the terminal end of chromatids. This is
known as terminalisation. As a result, complete
separation of homologous chromosomes
occurs. (Figure 3.10)

autosomal genes a and b, where a

(a) a and b are located on separate
autosomes.

(b) a and b are linked on the same
autosome but are so far apart that a
crossover occurs between them.

(c) a and b are linked on the same
autosome but are so close together that
a crossover almost never occurs.
{{< /box >}}

**3.3.3 Importance of Crossing Over**

Crossing over occurs in all organisms like
bacteria, yeast, fungi, higher plants and animals.
Its importance is

Exchange of segments leads to new gene combinations which plays an important
role in evolution.

Studies of crossing over reveal that genes
are arranged linearly on the chromosomes.

Genetic maps are made based on the
frequency of crossing over.

Crossing over helps to understand the
nature and mechanism of gene action.

If a useful new combination is formed it
can be used in plant breeding.

**3.3.4 Recombination**

Crossing over results in the formation of new
combination of characters in an organism
called recombinants. In this, segments of DNA
are broken and recombined to produce new
combinations of alleles. This process is called
Recombination.
Calculation of Recombination Frequency (RF)
The percentage of recombinant progeny
in a cross is called recombination frequency.
The recombination frequency (cross over
frequency) (RF) is calculated by using the
following formula. The data is obtained from
alleles in coupling configuration.

**3.3.5 Genetic Mapping**

Genes are present in a linear order along the
chromosome. They are present in a specific
location called locus (plural: loci). The
diagrammatic representation of position of
genes and related distances between the adjacent
genes is called genetic mapping. It is directly
proportional to the frequency of recombination
between them. It is also called as linkage map.
The concept of gene mapping was first developed
by Morgan’s student Alfred H Sturtevant in
1913. It provides clues about where the genes lies
on that chromosome.

**Map distance**

The unit of distance in a genetic map
is called a map unit (m.u). One map unit is
equivalent to one percent of crossing over
(Figure 4. ). One map unit is also called a
centimorgan (cM) in honour of T.H. Morgan.
100 centimorgan is equal to one Morgan (M).
For example: A distance between A and B genes
is estimated to be 3.5 map units. It is equal to 3.5
centimorgans or 3.5 % or 0.035 recombination
frequency between the genes.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.28.png )

Uses of genetic mapping

It is used to determine gene order, identify
the locus of a gene and calculate the
distances between genes.

They are useful in predicting results of
dihybrid and trihybrid crosses.

It allows the geneticists to understand the overall genetic complexity of particular
organism.

**3.4 Multiple alleles**

A given phenotypic trait of an individual
depends on a single pair of genes, each of which
occupies a specific position called the locus on
homologous chromosome. When any of the
three or more allelic forms of a gene occupy
the same locus in a given pair of homologous
chromosomes, they are said to be called
multiple alleles.

{{< box title="" type="">}}
Check your Grasp
There may be multiple alleles within the
population, but individuals have only two of
those alleles. Why?
{{< /box >}}

**3.4.1 Characteristics of multiple alleles**

Multiple alleles of a series always occupy
the same locus in the homologous
chromosome. Therefore, no crossing over
occurs within the alleles of a series.

Multiple alleles are always responsible for
the same character.

The wild type alleles of a series exhibit
dominant character whereas mutant
type will influence dominance or an
intermediate phenotypic effect.

When any two of the mutant multiple
alleles are crossed the phenotype is always
mutant type and not the wild type 

**3.4.2 Self-sterility in Nicotiana**

In plants, multiple alleles have been reported
in association with self-sterility or self-
incompatibility. Self-sterility means that the
pollen from a plant is unable to germinate on its
own stigma and will not be able to bring about
fertilization in the ovules of the same plant. East
(1925) observed multiple alleles in Nicotiana
which are responsible for self-incompatibility
or self-sterility. The gene for self-incompatibility
can be designated as S, which has allelic series
S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, S<sub>3</sub>, S<sub>4</sub> and S<sub>5</sub> (Figure 3.17).


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.29.png )

The cross-fertilizing tobacco plants
were not always homozygous as S<sub>1</sub>S<sub>1</sub> or S<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>,
but all plants were heterozygous as S<sub>1</sub>S<sub>2</sub>,
S3S4, S<sub>5</sub>S<sub>5</sub>. When crosses were made between
different S<sub>1</sub>S<sub>2</sub> plants, the pollen tube did not
develop normally. But effective pollen tube development was observed when crossing was made with other than S<sub>1</sub>S<sub>2</sub> for example S<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub>


**table 3.5 to be add..**


When crosses were made between seed
parents with S<sub>1</sub>S<sub>2</sub> and pollen parents with S<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>,
two kinds of pollen tubes were distinguished.
Pollen grains carrying S<sub>2</sub> were not effective,
but the pollen grains carrying S<sub>3</sub> were
capable of fertilization. Thus, from the cross
S<sub>1</sub>S<sub>2</sub>XS<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub>, all the pollens were effective and
four kinds of progeny resulted: S<sub>1</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, S<sub>1</sub>S<sub>4</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>S4. Some combinations are showed in
the table-3.5


**3.5.3 Sex determination in maize**

Zea mays (maize) is an example for monoecious,
which means male and female flowers are
present on the same plant. There are two types of inflorescence.
The terminal inflorescence which bears staminate florets develops
from shoot apical meristem called tassel. The lateral inflorescence which develop pistillate
florets from axillary bud is called ear or cob.
Unisexuality in maize occurs through the
selective abortion of stamens in ear florets
and pistils in tassel florets. A substitution
of two single gene pairs 'ba' for barren plant
and 'ts' for tassel seed makes the difference
between monoecious and dioecious (rare)
maize plants. The allele for barren plant (ba)
when homozygous makes the stalk staminate
by eliminating silk and ears. The allele for
tassel seed (ts) transforms tassel into a
pistillate structure that produce no pollen. The
table-3.7 is the resultant sex expression based
on the combination of these alleles. Most of
these mutations are shown to be defects in
gibberellin biosynthesis. Gibberellins play an
important role in the suppression of stamens
in florets on the ears.

3.5 Mutation
Genetic variation among
individuals provides the raw
material for the ultimate
source
of
evolutionary
changes. Mutation and
recombination are the two major processes
responsible for genetic variation. A sudden
change in the genetic material of an organisms
is called mutation. The term mutation was
introduced by Hugo de Vries (1901) while he
has studying on the plant, evening primrose
(Oenothera lamarkiana) and proposed
‘Mutation theory’. There are two broad
types of changes in genetic material. They are
point mutation and chromosomal mutations.
Mutational events that take place within
individual genes are called gene mutations or
point mutation, whereas the changes occur in
structure and number of chromosomes is called
chromosomal mutation. Agents which are
responsible for mutation are called mutagens,
that increase the rate of mutation. Mutations
can occur either spontaneously or induced.
The production of mutants through exposure
of mutagens is called mutagenesis, and the organism is said to be mutagenized.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.31.png )

**3.6.1 Types of mutation** 

Let us see the two general classes of gene mutation:

•Mutations affecting single base or base
pair of DNA are called point mutation

•Mutations altering the number of copies
of a small repeated nucleotide sequence
within a gene

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.32.png )

**table3.8 to be add**


**Point mutation**

It refers to alterations of single base pairs
of DNA or of a small number of adjacent base

**pairs**

Types of point mutations
Point mutation in DNA are categorised
into two main types. They are base pair
substitutions and base pair insertions or
deletions. Base substitutions are mutations in
which there is a change in the DNA such that one base pair is replaced by another (Figure:
3.17). It can be divided into two subtypes:
transitions and transversions. Addition or
deletion mutations are actually additions or
deletions of nucleotide pairs and also called
base pair addition or deletions. Collectively,
they are termed indel mutations (for
insertion-deletion).
Substitution mutations or indel mutations
affect translation. Based on these different types
of mutations are given below.
The mutation that changes one codon for
an amino acid into another codon for that same
amino acid are called Synonymous or silent
mutations. The mutation where the codon
for one amino acid is changed into a codon
for another amino acid is called Missense or
non-synonymous mutations. The mutations
where codon for one amino acid is changed
into a termination or stop codon is called
Nonsense mutation. Mutations that result in
the addition or deletion of a single base pair
of DNA that changes the reading frame for
the translation process as a result of which
there is complete loss of normal protein
structure and function are called Frameshift
mutations (Figure: 3.19).

**3.6.2 Mutagenic agents**

The factors which cause genetic mutation
are called mutagenic agents or mutagens.
Mutagens are of two types, physical mutagen
and chemical mutagen. Muller (1927) was the
first to find out physical mutagen in Drosophila.

Physical mutagens:

Scientists are using temperature and
radiations such as X rays, gamma rays, alfa rays,
beta rays, neutron, cosmic rays, radioactive
isotopes, ultraviolet rays as physical mutagen to
produce mutation in various plants and animals.
Temperature: Increase in temperature
increases the rate of mutation. While rise
in temperature, breaks the hydrogen bonds
between two DNA nucleotides which affects the
process of replication and transcription.
Radiation: The electromagnetic spectrum
contains shorter and longer wave length rays
than the visible spectrum. These are classified
into ionizing and non-ionizing radiation.
Ionizing radiation are short wave length and
carry enough higher energy to ionize electrons
from atom. X rays, gamma rays, alfa rays,
beta rays and cosmic rays which breaks the
chromosomes (chromosomal mutation) and chromatids in irradiated cells. Non-ionizing
radiation, UV rays have longer wavelengths
and carry lower energy, so they have lower
penetrating power than the ionizing radiations.
It is used to treat unicellular microorganisms,
spores, pollen grains which possess nuclei
located near surface membrane.

**Sharbati Sonora**

Sharbati Sonora is a mutant variety of wheat,
which is developed from Mexican variety
(Sonora 64) by irradiating of gamma rays. It
is the work of Dr. M.S.Swaminathan who is
known as ‘Father of Indian green revolution’
and his team.

**Castor Aruna**

Castor Aruna is mutant variety of castor which
is developed by treatment of seeds with thermal
neutrons in order to induce very early maturity
(120 days instead of 270 days as original variety).

**Chemical mutagens:**

Chemicals which induce mutation are
called chemical mutagens. Some chemical
mutagens are mustard gas, nitrous acid,
ethyl and methyl methane sulphonate (EMS
and MMS), ethyl urethane, magnous salt,
formaldehyde, eosin and enthrosine. Example:
Nitrous oxide alters the nitrogen bases of DNA
and disturb the replication and transcription
that leads to the formation of incomplete and
defective polypeptide during translation.

Mustard gas (Dichloro ethyl sulphide) used as
chemical weapon in world war I.
H J Muller (1928) first time used X rays to
induce mutations in fruit fly.
L J Stadler reported induced mutations in
plants by using X rays and gamma rays.
Chemical mutagenesis was first reported by
C. Auerback (1944).

**Comutagens**

The compounds which are not having
own mutagenic properties but can enhance the effects of known mutagens are called

comutagens.

Example: Ascorbic acid increase the damage
caused by hydrogen peroxide.
Caffeine increase the toxicity of methotrexate

**3.6.3 Chromosomal mutations**

The genome can also be modified on a larger
scale by altering the chromosome structure or
by changing the number of chromosomes in
a cell. These large-scale variations are termed
as chromosomal mutations or chromosomal
aberrations. Gene mutations are changes that
take place within a gene, whereas chromosomal
mutations are changes to a chromosome region
consisting of many genes. It can be detected
by microscopic examination, genetic analysis,
or both. In contrast, gene mutations are never
detectable microscopically. Chromosomal
mutations are divided into two groups: changes
in chromosome number and changes in
chromosome structure.

**I.Changes in chromosome number**

Each cell of living organisms possesses
fixed number of chromosomes. It varies in
different species. Even though some species of plants and animals are having identical
number of chromosomes, they will not be
similar in character. Hence the number
of chromosomes will not differentiate the
character of species from one another but
the nature of hereditary material (gene) in
chromosome that determines the character of
species.
Sometimes the chromosome number of
somatic cells are changed due to addition or
elimination of individual chromosome or basic
set of chromosomes. This condition in known
as numerical chromosomal aberration or
ploidy. There are two types of ploidy.

(i).	Ploidy involving individual chromosomes
within a diploid set (Aneuploidy)

(ii).	Ploidy involving entire sets of chromosomes (Euploidy) (Figure 3.20)

(i)Aneuploidy

It is a condition in which diploid number
is altered either by addition or deletion
of one or more chromosomes. Organisms
showing aneuploidy are known as aneuploids
or heteroploids. They are of two types,
Hyperploidy and Hypoploidy (Figure 3.21).

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.33.png )

1.Hyperploidy
Addition of one or more chromosomes to
diploid sets are called hyperploidy. Diploid
set of chromosomes represented as Disomy.
Hyperploidy can be divided into three types.
They are as follows,

(a) Trisomy
Addition of single chromosome to diploid set
is called Simple trisomy(2n+1). Trisomics were
first reported by Blackeslee (1910) in Datura
stramonium (Jimson weed). But later it was
reported in Nicotiana, Pisum and Oenothera.
Sometimes addition of two individual
chromosome from different chromosomal
pairs to normal diploid sets are called Double
trisomy (2n+1+1).

(b) Tetrasomy

Addition of a pair or two individual pairs of
chromosomes to diploid set is called tetrasomy
(2n+2) and Double tetrasomy (2n+2+2)
respectively. All possible tetrasomics are
available in Wheat.

(c) Pentasomy

Addition of three individual chromosome from
different chromosomal pairs to normal diploid
set are called pentasomy (2n+3).

2.Hypoploidy
Loss of one or more chromosome from the
diploid set in the cell is called hypoploidy. It
can be divided into two types. They are

(a) Monosomy

Loss of a single chromosome from the diploid
set are called monosomy(2n-1). However
loss of two individual or three individual
chromosomes are called double monosomy
(2n-1-1) and triple monosomy (2n-1-1-1)
respectively. Double monosomics are observed
in maize.

(b) Nullisomy

Loss of a pair of homologous chromosomes or two pairs of homologous chromosomes from
the diploid set are called Nullisomy (2n-2) and
double Nullisomy (2n-2-2) respectively. Selfing
of monosomic plants produce nullisomics. They
are usually lethal.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.34.png )

(ii) Euploidy
Euploidy is a condition where the organisms
possess one or more basic sets of chromosomes.
Euploidy is classified as monoploidy, diploidy
and polyploidy. The condition where an
organism or somatic cell has two sets of
chromosomes are called diploid (2n). Half the
number of somatic chromosomes is referred
as gametic chromosome number called
haploid(n). It should be noted that haploidy (n)
is different from a monoploidy (x). For example,
the common wheat plant is a polyploidy
(hexaploidy) 2n=6x=72 chromosomes. Its
haploid number (n) is 36, but its monoploidy
(x) is 12. Therefore, the haploid and diploid
condition came regularly one after another and
the same number of chromosomes is maintained
from generation to generation, but monoploidy
condition occurs when an organism is under
polyploidy condition. In a true diploid both the
monoploid and haploid chromosome number
are same. Thus a monoploid can be a haploid
but all haploids cannot be a monoploid.
Polyploidy

Polyploidy is the condition where an
organism possesses more than two basic sets of chromosomes. When there are three, four, five or six basic sets of chromosomes, they are called
triploidy (3x) tetraploidy (4x), pentaploidy (5x)
and hexaploidy (6x) respectively. Generally,
polyploidy is very common in plants but
rarer in animals. An increase in the number
of chromosome sets has been an important
factor in the origin of new plant species. But
higher ploidy level leads to death. Polyploidy
is of two types. They are autopolyploidy and
allopolyploidy

1.Autopolyploidy
The organism which possesses more than two
haploid sets of chromosomes derived from
within the same species is called autopolyploid.
They are divided into two types. Autotriploids
and autotetraploids.

Autotriploids have three set of its own
genomes. They can be produced artificially by
crossing between autotetraploid and diploid
species. They are highly sterile due to defective
gamete formation. Example: The cultivated
banana are usually triploids and are seedless
having larger fruits than diploids. Triploid sugar
beets have higher sugar content than diploids
and are resistant to moulds. Common doob grass
(Cyanodon dactylon) is a natural autotriploid.
Seedless watermelon, apple, sugar beet, tomato,
banana are man made autotriploids.
Autotetraploids have four copies of its own
genome. They may be induced by doubling the
chromosomes of a diploid species. Example: rye,
grapes, alfalfa, groundnut, potato and coffee.

2.Allopolyploidy

An organism which possesses two or more
basic sets of chromosomes derived from two
different species is called allopolyploidy. It
can be developed by interspecific crosses and
fertility is restored by chromosome doubling
with colchicine treatment. Allopolyploids are
formed between closely related species only.
(Figure 3.22)

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.35.png )

Example:1

Raphanobrassica,G.D.Karpechenko (1927) a Russian geneticist,
crossed the radish (Raphanus sativus, 2n=18)
and cabbage (Brassica oleracea, 2n=18) to
produce F1 hybrid which was sterile. When he
doubled the chromosome of F1 hybrid he got
it fertile. He expected this plant to exhibit the
root of radish and the leaves like cabbage, which
would make the entire plant edible, but the case
was vice versa, so he was greatly disappointed.

Example: 2 Triticale, the successful first man
made cereal. Depending on the ploidy level
Triticale can be divided into three main groups.
Tetraploidy: Crosses between diploid

(i).wheat and rye.

(ii).	Hexaploidy: Crosses between tetraploid wheat
Triticum durum (macaroni wheat) and rye

(iii). Octoploidy: Crosses between hexaploid
wheat T. aestivum (bread wheat) and rye
Hexaploidy Triticale hybrid plants demonstrate
characteristics of both macaroni wheat and rye.
For example, they combine the high-protein
content of wheat with rye’s high content of the
amino acid lysine, which is low in wheat. It can
be explained by chart below (Figure: 3.23).

Activity: Solve this
When two plants (A and B) belonging to the
same genus but different species are crossed,
the F1 hybrid is viable and has more ornate
flowers. Unfortunately, this hybrid is sterile
and can only be propagated by vegetative
cuttings. Explain the sterility of the hybrid
and what would have to occur for the
sterility of this hybrid to be reversed.

{{< /box >}}

Significance of Ploidy

• Many polyploids are more vigorous and
more adaptable than diploids.

• Many ornamental plants are autotetraploids
and have larger flowers and longer flowering
duration than diploids.

• Autopolyploids usually have higher in fresh
weight due to more water content.

• Aneuploids are useful to determine the
phenotypic effects of loss or gain of different
chromosomes.

• Many angiosperms are allopolyploids and
they play a role in the evolution of plants.

II	Structural changes in chromosome
(Structural chromosomal aberration)
Structural variations caused by addition or deletion of a part of chromosome leading to
rearrangement of genes is called structural
chromosomal aberration. It occurs due to
ionizing radiation or chemical compounds. On
the basis of breaks and reunion in chromosomes,
there are four types of aberrations. They are
classified under two groups.

A. Changes in the number of the gene loci

1. Deletion or Deficiency

2. Duplication or Repeat

B. Changes in the arrangement of gene loci

3. Inversion

4. Translocation


1.Deletion or Deficiency
Loss of a portion of chromosome is called
deletion. On the basis of location of breakage
on chromosome, it is divided into terminal
deletion and intercalary deletion. It occurs
due to chemicals, drugs and radiations. It is
observed in Drosophila and Maize. (Figure 3.24)

2.Duplication or Repeat
The process of arrangement of the same order
of genes repeated more than once in the same
chromosome is known as duplication. Due to
duplication some genes are present in more than
two copies. It was first reported in Drosophila
by Bridges (1919) and other examples are Maize
and Pea. It is three types.

4.Translocation
The transfer of a segment of chromosome
to a non-homologous chromosome is called
translocation. Translocation should not
be confused with crossing over, in which
an exchange of genetic material between
homologous chromosome takes place.
Translocation occurs as a result of interchange
of chromosome segments in non-homologous
chromosomes. There are three types

i. Simple translocation

ii. Shift translocation

iii. Reciprocal translocation

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.38.png )

**Summary**

Chromosomal theory of inheritance states
that Mendelian factors have specific locus on
chromosomes and they carry information
from one generation to the next generation.
Genes located close together on the same
chromosome and inherited together are called
linked genes the phenomenon is called Linkage.
Two types of linkage are complete linkage and
incomplete linkage. The groups of linearly
arranged linked genes are called Linkage
groups. Crossing over is a biological process
that produces new combination of genes by
inter-changing the corresponding segments
between non-sister chromatids of homologous
pair of chromosomes. In this segments of
DNA are broken and recombined to produce
new combinations of alleles a process is
called Recombination. The diagrammatic
representation of distances between the
adjacent genes which is directly proportional
to the frequency of recombination between
them is called genetic mapping. When any of
the three or more allelic forms of a gene occupy
the same locus in a given pair of homologous
chromosomes, they are said to be multiple alleles. They are m, M1 and M2 of a single
gene. Mutational events that take place within
individual genes are called gene mutations or
point mutation, whereas the changes that occur
in structure and number of chromosomes are
called chromosomal mutation. The agents
which are responsible for mutation is called
mutagens.
