Genetics is the study of how living
things receive common traits from previous
generations. No field of science has changed the
world more, in the past 50 years than genetics.
The scientific and technological advances in
genetics have transformed agriculture, medicine
and forensic science etc.

Genetics – The Science of heredity (Inheritance)
-“Genetics” is the branch of biological science
which deals with the mechanism of transmission
of characters from parents to offsprings. The term
**Genetics** was introduced by **W. Bateson in 1906.**
The four major subdisciplines of genetics are

Genes – Functional Units of inheritance:
The basic unit of heredity (biological
information) which transmits biochemical,
anatomical and behavioural traits from
parents to offsprings.




**2.1 Heredity and variation**

Genetics is often described as a science which
deals with heredity and variation.

**Heredity:** Heredity is the transmission of
characters from parents to offsprings.

**Variation:** The organisms belonging to the
same natural population or species that
shows a difference in the characteristics is
called variation. Variation is of two types (i)
Discontinuous variation and (ii) Continuous
variation.

**1. Discontinuous Variation:**

Within a population there are some
characteristics which show a limited form of
variation. Example: Style length in Primula,
plant height of garden pea. In discontinuous
variation, the characteristics are controlled by
genes which may have one or two major two or more allelic forms. These variations are
genetically determined by inheritance factors.
Individuals produced by this variation show
differences without any intermediate form
between them and there is no overlapping
between the two phenotypes. The phenotypic
expression is unaffected by environmental
conditions. This is also called as qualitative
inheritance.

**2.Continuous Variation:**

This variation may be due to the combining
effects of environmental and genetic factors.
In a population most of the characteristics
exhibit a complete gradation, from one extreme
to the other without any break. Inheritance
of phenotype is determined by the combined
effects of many genes, (polygenes) and
environmental factors. This is also known as
quantitative inheritance. Example: Human
height and skin color.

**Importance of variations**

<<<<<<< HEAD
* Variations make some individuals better
fitted in the struggle for existence.

* They help the individuals to adapt
themselves to the changing environment.

* It provides the genetic material for natural
selection

* Variations allow breeders to improve better
yield, quicker growth, increased resistance
and lesser input.

* They constitute the raw materials for
evolution.

**2.2 Mendelism**

The contribution of Mendel to Genetics is called
Mendelism. It includes all concepts brought out
by Mendel through his original research on
plant hybridization. Mendelian genetic concepts
are basic to modern genetics. Therefore, Mendel
is called as **Father of Genetics**


### 2.2.1 Father of Genetics – Gregor Johann Mendel (1822 – 1884)

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.1.png )


The first Geneticist,Gregor Johann Mendel unraveled the mystery of heredity. He was born on 22<sup>nd</sup> July 1822 in Heinzendorf Silesia (now Hyncice,Czechoslovakia) Austria. After school education, later he studied botany, physics and
mathematics at the University of Vienna.He
then entered a monastery of St.Thomas at Brunn
in Austria and continued his interest in plant
hybridization.In 1849 Mendel got a temporary
position in a school as a teacher and he performed
a series of elegant experiments with pea plants
in his garden. In 1856, he started his historic
studies on pea plants. 1856 to 1863 was the
period of Mendel’s hybridization experiments
on pea plants. Mendel discovered the principles
of heredity by studying the inheritance of seven
pairs of contrasting traits of pea plant in his
garden. Mendel crossed and catalogued 24,034
<<<<<<< HEAD
plants through many generations. His paper entitled **“Experiments on Plant Hybrids”** was

His paper entitled **“Experiments on Plant Hybrids”** was

presented and published in The Proceedings of
the Brunn Society of Natural History in 1866.
Mendel was the first systematic researcher in
the field of genetics.

**Mendel was successful because:**

**2.2.2 Mendel’s experiments on pea plant**

Mendel’s theory of inheritance, known as the
Particulate theory, establishes the existence of
minute particles or hereditary units or factors,
<<<<<<< HEAD
which are now called as genes. He performed
artificial pollination or cross pollination experiments with several true-breeding lines of pea plants. A true breeding lines (Pure-breeding

which are now called as **genes.** He performed
artificial pollination or cross pollination experiments with several true-breeding lines of
pea plants. A true breeding lines (Pure-breeding
>>>>>>> d8bede8b (Review completed Unit 7 - chapter 1)
strains) means it has undergone continuous
self pollination having stable trait inheritance
from parent to offspring. Matings within pure
breeding lines produce offsprings having specific
parental traits that are constant in inheritance
and expression for many generations. Pure line
breed refers to homozygosity only. Fusion of
male and female gametes produced by the same
individual i.e pollen and egg are

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.2.png )


derived from the same plant is known as self-
fertilization. Self pollination takes place in
Mendel’s peas. The experimenter can remove
the anthers (Emasculation) before fertilization
and transfer the pollen from another variety of
pea to the stigma of flowers where the anthers
are removed. This results in cross-fertilization,
which leads to the creation of hybrid varieties
with different traits. Mendel’s work on the
study of the pattern of inheritance and the
principles or laws formulated, now constitute
the Mendelian Genetics.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.3.png )

**Figure 2.4: Mendel’s seven characters in Garden Peas, shown on the plant’s seven chromosomes**



  Mendel worked at the rules of inheritance
and arrived at the correct mechanism before any
knowledge of cellular mechanism, DNA, genes,
chromosomes became available. Mendel insights
and meticulous work into the mechanism of
inheritance played an important role which led
to the development of improved crop varieties
and a revolution in crop hybridization.

Mendel died in 1884. In 1900 the work of
Mendel’s experiments were rediscovered by three biologists, **Hugo de Vries** of Holland, **CarlCorrens** of Germany and **Erich von Tschermak**
of Austria.

>>>>>>> d8bede8b (Review completed Unit 7 - chapter 1)
It is quite fascinating to trace the Mendel’s
genes. In 2010, the gene responsible for regulating flower colour in peas were identified by an Figure 2.5: Purple flower international team of Pea with Pea Gene A
of researchers. and White flower of Pea
It was called **Pea Gene A** which encodes a **protein**
that functions as a transcription factor
which is responsible for the production of
**anthocyanin pigment**. So the flowers are
purple. Pea plants with white flowers do not
have anthocyanin, even though they have
the gene that encodes the enzyme involved
in anthocyanin synthesis.
Researchers delivered normal copies of
gene A into the cells of the petals of white
flowers by the gene gun method. When
Gene A entered in a small percentage of
cells of white flowers it is expressed in those
particular cells, accumulated anthocyanin
pigments and became purple.

In white flowers the gene A sequence showed
a single-nucleotide change that makes
the transcription factor inactive. So the
mutant form of gene A do not accumulate
anthocyanin and hence they are white.

**2.2.3 Terminology related to Mendelism**

Mendel noticed two different expressions of
a trait – Example: Tall and dwarf. Traits are
expressed in different ways due to the fact that a
gene can exist in alternate forms (versions) for
the same trait is called **alleles***. If an individual has two identical alleles of
a gene, it is called as **homozygous(TT)**. An
individual with two different alleles is called
**heterozygous(Tt)**. Mendels non-true breeding
plants are heterozygous, called as **hybrids**.
When the gene has two alleles the dominant
allele is symbolized with capital letter and the
recessive with small letter. When both alleles are
recessive the individual is called **homozygous recessive (tt)** dwarf pea plants. An individual with two dominant alleles is called homozygous
**dominant (TT)** tall pea plants. One dominant
allele and one recessive allele (Tt) denotes non-
true breeding tall pea plants **heterozygous tall.**

**2.2.4 <u> Mendelian inheritance – Mendel’s Laws of Heredity** </u>

Mendel proposed two rules based on his
observations on monohybrid cross, today these
rules are called laws of inheritance The first law
is The Law of Dominance and the second law
is The Law of Segregation. These scientific laws
play an important role in the history of evolution.

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

>>>>>>> d8bede8b (Review completed Unit 7 - chapter 1)
**The Law of Dominance:** The characters are
controlled by discrete units called factors which
occur in pairs. In a dissimilar pair of factors one
member of the pair is dominant and the other
is recessive. This law gives an explanation to the
monohybrid cross (a) the expression of only one
of the parental characters in F<sub>1</sub> generation and (b)
the expression of both in the F<sub>2</sub> generation. It also
<<<<<<< HEAD
explains the proportion of 3:1 obtained at the F<sub>1</sub>

**The Law of Segregation (Law of Purity of gametes):**
=======
explains the proportion of 3:1 obtained at the F<sub>2</sub>

**The Law of Segregation (Law of Purity of gametes):** 
>>>>>>> d8bede8b (Review completed Unit 7 - chapter 1)
Alleles do not show any blending,
both characters are seen as such in the F<sub>2</sub>
generation although one of the characters is not
seen in the F<sub>1</sub> generation. During the formation
of gametes, the factors or alleles of a pair separate
and segregate from each other such that each
gamete receives only one of the two factors. A
homozygous parent produces similar gametes
and a heterozygous parent produces two kinds
of gametes each having one allele with equal
proportion. **Gametes are never hybrid**.

### <u> 2.3 Monohybrid cross </u>

Monohybrid inheritance is the inheritance of a
single character i.e. plant height.It involves the
inheritance of two alleles of a single gene. When
<<<<<<< HEAD
the F<sub>1</sub> generation was selfed Mendel noticed that
787 of 1064 F<sub>2</sub> plants were tall, while 277 of 1064
were dwarf. The dwarf trait disappeared in the F<sub>1</sub>
generation only to reappear in the F<sub>2</sub> generation.
The term **genotype** is the genetic constitution
of an individual. The term **phenotype** refers to

The term **genotype** is the genetic constitution

>>>>>>> d8bede8b (Review completed Unit 7 - chapter 1)
the observable characteristic of an organism. In
a genetic cross the genotypes and **phenotypes**
of offspring, resulting from combining gametes
during fertilization can be easily understood with
the help of a diagram called Punnett’s Square named
after a British Geneticist Reginald C.Punnett.
It is a graphical representation to calculate the

probability of all possible genotypes of offsprings
in a genetic cross.The Law of Dominance and the
Law of Segregation give suitable explanation to
<<<<<<< HEAD

>>>>>>> d8bede8b (Review completed Unit 7 - chapter 1)

**Reciprocal cross** – In one experiment, the
tall pea plants were pollinated with the pollens
from a true-breeding dwarf plants, the result
was all tall plants. When the parental types were
reversed, the pollen from a tall plant was used to
pollinate a dwarf pea plant which gave only tall
plants. The result was the same - All tall plants.
Tall ( ) x Dwarf ( ) and Tall ( ) x Dwarf ( )
matings are done in both ways which are called
reciprocal crosses.The results of the reciprocal
crosses are the same. So it was concluded that the
trait is not sex dependent. The results of Mendel’s
monohybrid crosses were not sex dependent.

The gene for plant height has two alleles: Tall
(T) x Dwarf (t). The phenotypic and genotypic
analysis of the crosses has been shown by
Checker board method or by Forkline method.



**2.3.1 Mendel’s analytical and empirical approach**

Mendel chose two contrasting traits for each
character. So it seemed logical that two distinct
factors exist. In F<sub>1</sub> the recessive trait and its
factors do not disappear and they are hidden or
<<<<<<< HEAD
masked only to reappear in  ¼  of the F<sub>2</sub> generation.
=======
masked only to reappear in ¼ of the F<sub>2</sub> generation.
>>>>>>> d8bede8b (Review completed Unit 7 - chapter 1)
He concluded that tall and dwarf alleles of F<sub>1</sub>
heterozygote segregate randomly into gametes.
Mendel got 3:1 ratio in F<sub>2</sub> between the dominant
and recessive trait. He was the first scientist to use
this type of quantitative analysis in a biological
experiment. Mendel’s data is concerned with the
proportions of offspring.

Mendel’s analytical approach is truly an
outstanding scientific achievement. His meticulous
work and precisely executed breeding experiments
proposed that discrete particulate units of heredity
are present and they are transmitted from one
generation to the other. Now they are called as
genes. Mendel’s experiments were well planned to
determine the relationships which govern hereditary
traits. This rationale is called an empirical approach.
Laws that were arrived from an empirical approach is known as empirical laws.

**2.3.2 Test cross**

Test cross is crossing an individual of unknown
genotype with a homozygous recessive.

In Mendel’s monohybrid cross all the plants
are tall in F<sub>1</sub> generation. In F<sub>2</sub> tall and dwarf plants
were in the ratio of 3:1.Mendel self pollinated
dwarf F<sub>2</sub> plants and got dwarf plants in F<sub>3</sub> and F<sub>4</sub>
generations. So he concluded that the genotype of
dwarf was homozygous (tt). The genotypes of tall
plants TT or Tt from F1and F<sub>2</sub> cannot be predicted.
But how we can tell if a tall plant is homozygous
or heterozygous? To determine the genotype of a
tall plant Mendel crossed the plants from F<sub>2</sub> with
the homozygous recessive dwarf plant. This he
called a test cross. The progenies of the test cross
can be easily analysed to predict the genotype of
the plant or the test organism. Thus in a typical test
cross an organism (pea plants) showing dominant
phenotype (whose genotype is to be determined)
is crossed with the recessive parent instead of self
crossing. Test cross is used to identify whether
an individual is homozygous or heterozygous for
dominant character.

the heterozygosity of the hybrid.

**2.3.4 Dihybrid cross**

It is a genetic cross which involves individuals
differing in two characters. Dihybrid inheritance is the inheritance of two separate genes each with two alleles.

{{< box title="" type="">}}

**Why Mendel’s pea plants are tall and dwarf?**

**Find out the molecular explanation.**

Molecular characterization of Mendel’s
gene for plant height.
The plant height is controlled by a single gene
with two alleles. The reason for this difference
in plant height is due to the following facts:
(i) the cells of the pea plant have the ability to
convert a precursor molecule of gibberellins
into an active form (GA1) (ii) Tall pea plants
have one allele (Le) that codes for a protein
(functional enzyme) which functions normally
in the gibberellin-synthesis pathway and
catalyzes the formation of gibberellins (GA1).
The allele is dominant even if it is two (Le Le)
or single (Le le), it produces gibberellins and
the pea plants are tall. Dwarf pea plants have
two recessive alleles (le le) which code for
non-functional protein, hence they are dwarf.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.8.png )

{{< /box >}}


**Law of Independent Assortment**

– Whentwo pairs of traits are combined in a hybrid,
segregation of one pair of characters is
independent to the other pair of characters. Genes
that are located in different chromosomes assort independently during meiosis. Many possible combinations of factors can occur in the gametes.




![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.9.png )


Independent assortment leads to genetic
diversity. If an individual produces genetically
dissimilar gametes it is the consequence of
independent assortment. Through independent
assortment, the maternal and paternal members
of all pairs were distributed to gametes, so all
possible chromosomal combinations were
produced leading to genetic variation. In sexually
reproducing plants / organisms, due to independent
assortment, genetic variation takes place which is
important in the process of evolution. The Law of
Segregation is concerned with alleles of one gene
but the Law of Independent Assortment deals with
the relationship between genes.

The crossing of two plants differing in two
pairs of contrasting traits is called dihybrid
cross. In dihybrid cross, two characters (colour
and shape) are considered at a time. Mendel
considered the seed shape (round and wrinkled)
and cotyledon colour (yellow & green) as the two
characters. In seed shape round (R) is dominant
over wrinkled (r) ; in cotyledon colour yellow
(Y) is dominant over green (y). Hence the pure



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.10.png )



breeding round yellow parent is represented by
the genotype RRYY and the pure breeding green
wrinkled parent is represented by the genotype
rryy. During gamete formation the paired genes
of a character assort out independently of the
other pair. During the F<sub>1</sub> x F<sub>1</sub> fertilization each
zygote with an equal probability receives one of
the four combinations from each parent. The


{{< box title="" type="">}}

**How does the wrinkled gene make Mendel’s peas wrinkled?** 

**Find out the molecular explanation.**

The protein called starch branching
enzyme (SBEI) is encoded by the wild-type
allele of the gene (RR) which is dominant.
When the seed matures, this enzyme SBEI
catalyzes the formation of highly branched
starch molecules. Normal gene (R) has
become interrupted by the insertion of extra
piece of DNA (0.8 kb) into the gene, resulting
in r allele. In the homozygous mutant form of
the gene (rr) which is recessive, the activity of
the enzyme SBEI is lost resulting in wrinkled
peas. The wrinkled seed accumulates more
sucrose and high water content. Hence the
osmotic pressure inside the seed rises. As
a result, the seed absorbs more water and
when it matures it loses water as it dries. So
it becomes wrinkled at maturation. When
the seed has atleast one copy of normal
dominant gene heterozygous, the dominant
allele helps to synthesize starch, amylopectin
an insoluble carbohydrate, with the osmotic
balance which minimises the loss of water
resulting in smooth structured round seed.

resultant gametes thus will be genetically different
and they are of the following four types:

<<<<<<< HEAD
1) Yellow round (YR)                      -  9/16

ratio of 9:3:3:1 as shown in the figure. Mendel’s
9:3:3:1 dihybrid ratio is an ideal ratio based on the
probability including segregation, independent
assortment and random fertilization. In sexually
reproducing organism / plants from the garden
peas to human beings, Mendel’s findings laid the
foundation for understanding inheritance and
revolutionized the field of biology. The dihybrid
cross and its result led Mendel to propose a second
set of generalisations that we called Mendel's Law
of independent assortment.


**2.3.5 The Dihybrid test cross**

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.12.png )



**2.3.7 Extensions of Mendelian Genetics**

Apart from monohybrid, dihybrid and
trihybrid crosses, there are exceptions to
Mendelian principles, i.e. the occurrence of
different phenotypic ratios. The more complex
patterns of inheritance are the extensions of
Mendelian Genetics. There are examples where
phenotype of the organism is the result of the
interactions among genes.

**Gene interaction** – A single phenotype is
controlled by more than one set of genes, each of
which has two or more alleles. This phenomenon
is called Gene Interaction. Many
characteristics of the organism
including structural and chemical
which constitute the phenotype are
the result of interaction between
two or more genes.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.13.png )



Mendelian experiments prove that a
single gene controls one character. But in the
post Mendelian findings, various exception
have been noticed, in which different types of interactions are possible between the genes.
This gene interaction concept was introduced
and explained by W. Bateson. This concept
is otherwise known as Factor hypothesis or
Bateson’s factor hypothesis. According to
Bateson’s factor hypothesis, the gene interactions
can be classified as

<<<<<<< HEAD

phenotype differs from both the parental
homozygous phenotype. This cross did not
exhibit the character of the dominant parent but
an intermediate colour pink. When one allele
is not completely dominant to another allele
it shows incomplete dominance. Such allelic
interaction is known as incomplete dominance.
F1 generation produces intermediate phenotype

plants of F<sub>1</sub> generation were interbred in F<sub>2</sub> both
phenotypic and genotypic ratios were found to
be identical as 1 : 2 : 1(1 red : 2 pink : 1 white).

Gene expression is explained in a quantitative
way. Wild-type allele which is a functional
allele when present in two copies (R<sup>1</sup> R<sup>1</sup>)
produces an functional enzyme which
synthesizes red pigments. The mutant allele
which is a defective allele in two copies (R<sup>2</sup> R<sup>2</sup>)
produces an enzyme which cannot synthesize
necessary red pigments. The white flower is

plant and so it is pink. The intermediate

I<sup>B</sup> alleles of I gene are codominant which follows
Mendels law of segregation. The codominance
was demonstrated in plants with the help of

In hybrids, additive banding pattern was noticed.
Their hybrid shows the presence of both the
types of proteins similar to their parents.
The heterozygote genotype gives rise to a

snapdragon (Antirrhinum sp.). It is an example
for recessive lethality. In snapdragon there are
three kinds of plants.

1.Green plants with chlorophyll. (CC)

2.Yellowish green plants with carotenoids are
referred to as pale green, golden or aurea
plants (Cc)

3.White plants without any chlorophyll. (cc)

The genotype of the homozygous green
plants is CC. The genotype of the homozygous
white plant is cc.

The aurea plants have the genotype Cc
because they are heterozygous of green and
white plants. When two such aurea plants
are crossed the F<sub>1</sub> progeny has identical
phenotypic and genotypic ratio of 1 : 2 : 1 (viz.
1 Green (CC) : 2 Aurea (Cc) : 1 White (cc))
Since the white plants lack chlorophyll
pigment, they will not survive. So the F<sub>2</sub>
ratio is modified into 1 : 2. In this case the
homozygous recessive genotype (cc) is lethal.

The term “lethal” is applied to those
changes in the genome of an organism which
produces effects severe enough to cause death.
Lethality is a condition in which the death of
certain genotype occurs prematurely. The fully
dominant or fully recessive lethal allele kills
the carrier individual only in its homozygous
condition. So the F<sub>2</sub> genotypic ratio will be 2 : 1
or 1 : 2 respectively.

**2.4.4. Pleiotropy – A single gene affects multiple traits**

In Pleiotropy, the single gene affects multiple
traits and alter the phenotype of the organism.
The Pleiotropic gene influences a number of characters simultaneously and such genes
are called pleiotropic gene. were crossed with
a variety of peas having white flowers, light
coloured seeds and no spot on the axils of the
leaves, the three traits for flower colour, seed
colour and a leaf axil spot all were inherited
together as a single unit. Another example is:
sickle cell anemia.

**2.5 Intergenic gene interactions**

Interlocus interactions take place between the alleles at different loci i.e between alleles of different genes.Itincludes the following:

**Dominant Epistasis** – It is a gene interaction in which
two alleles of a gene at one locus interfere and
suppress or mask the phenotypic expression
of a different pair of alleles of another gene at
another locus. The gene that suppresses or masks
the phenotypic expression of a gene at another
<<<<<<< HEAD
locus is known as **epistatic.** The gene whose
=======
locus is known as **epistatic**. The gene whose
>>>>>>> d8bede8b (Review completed Unit 7 - chapter 1)
expression is interfered by non-allelic genes and
prevents from exhibiting its character is known
as **hypostatic**. When both the genes are present
together, the phenotype is determined by the
epistatic gene and not by the hypostatic gene.


In the summer squash the fruit colour locus
has a dominant allele ‘W’ for white colour and a
recessive allele ‘w’ for coloured fruit. ‘W’ allele is
dominant that masks the expression of any colour.
In another locus hypostatic allele ‘G’ is for yellow
fruit and its recessive allele ‘g’ for green fruit. In the
first locus the white is dominant to colour where
as in the second locus yellow is dominant to green.
When the white fruit with genotype WWgg is
crossed with yellow fruit with genotype wwGG,
the F<sub>1</sub> plants have white fruit and are heterozygous
(WwGg). When F<sub>1</sub> heterozygous plants are crossed
they give rise to F<sub>2</sub> with the phenotypic ratio of 12
white : 3 yellow : 1 green.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.16.png )

Since W is epistatic to the alleles ‘G’ and
‘g’, the white which is dominant, masks the
effect of yellow or green. Homozygous
recessive ww genotypes only can give the
coloured fruits (4/16). Double recessive
‘wwgg’ will give green fruit (1/16). The Plants
having only ‘G’ in its genotype (wwGg or
wwGG) will give the yellow fruit(3/16).

**2.6 Polygenic Inheritance in Wheat(Kernel colour)**

Polygenic inheritance - Several genes combine
to affect a single trait.

A group of genes that together determine
(contribute) a characteristic of an organism
is called polygenic inheritance. It gives
explanations to the inheritance of continuous
traits which are compatible with Mendel’s Law.

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

>>>>>>> d8bede8b (Review completed Unit 7 - chapter 1)
The first experiment on polygenic
inheritance was demonstrated by Swedish
Geneticist H. Nilsson - Ehle (1909) in wheat
kernels. Kernel colour is controlled by two
genes each with two alleles, one with red kernel
colour was dominant to white. He crossed the
two pure breeding wheat varieties dark red
<<<<<<< HEAD
and a white. Dark red genotypes R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>R<sub>2</sub> and
white genotypes are r<sub>1</sub>r<sub>1</sub>r<sub>2</sub>r<sub>2</sub>. In the F<sub>1</sub>generation  medium red were obtained with the genotype
R<sub>1</sub>r<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>r<sub>2</sub>. F<sub>1</sub> wheat plant produces four types of gametes R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>1</sub>r<sub>2</sub>, r<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>, r<sub>1</sub>r<sub>2</sub>. The intensity of the red colour is determined by the number of R genes in the F<sub>2</sub> generation.

**Four R genes:** A dark red kernel colour is obtained.**Three R genes:** Medium - dark red kernel colour is obtained.**Two R genes:** Medium-
red kernel colour is obtained.**One R gene:** Light
red kernel colour is obtained. **Absence of R gene:**  Results in White kernel colour.

and a white. Dark red genotypes R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>R2 and
white genotypes are r<sub>1</sub>r<sub>1</sub>r<sub>2</sub>r<sub>2</sub>. In the F1 generation
medium red were obtained with the genotype
R<sub>1</sub>r<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>r<sub>2</sub>. F1 wheat plant produces four types of
gametes R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>1</sub>r<sub>1</sub>2, r<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>, r<sub>1</sub>r<sub>2</sub>. The intensity of the red colour is determined by the number of R genes in the F<sub>2</sub> generation.


**Four R genes:** A dark red kernel colour is
obtained.**Three R genes:** Medium - dark red
kernel colour is obtained.**Two R genes:** Medium-
red kernel colour is obtained.One R gene: Light
red kernel colour is obtained.**Absence of R**
gene:Results in White kernel colour.

>>>>>>> d8bede8b (Review completed Unit 7 - chapter 1)
The R gene in an additive manner produces the
red kernel colour. The number of each phenotype
is plotted against the intensity of red kernel
colour which produces a bell shaped curve. This
represents the distribution of phenotype. Other
example: Height and skin colour in humans are
controlled by three pairs of genes.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.17.png )


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.18.png )


**Conclusion:**

Finally the loci that was studied by Nilsson –
Ehle were not linked and the genes assorted
independently.Later, researchers discovered the third gene
that also affect the kernel colour of wheat. The
three independent pairs of alleles were involved
in wheat kernel colour. Nilsson – Ehle found
the ratio of 63 red : 1 white in F<sub>2</sub> generation –
1 : 6 : 15 : 20 : 15 : 6 : 1 in F<sub>2</sub> generation.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.19.png )



From the above results Nilsson – Ehle
showed that the blending inheritance was
not taking place in the kernel of wheat. In F<sub>2</sub>
generation plants have kernels with wide range of colour variation. This is due to the fact thatthe genes are segregating and recombination
takes place. Another evidence for the absence
of blending inheritance is that the parental
phenotypes dark red and white appear again
in F<sub>2</sub>. There is no blending of genes, only the
phenotype. The cumulative effect of several pairs
of gene interaction gives rise to many shades of
kernel colour. He hypothesized that the two loci
must contribute additively to the kernel colour
of wheat. The contribution of each red allele to
the kernel colour of wheat is additive.

**2.7 Extra Chromosomal Inheritance or Extra Nuclear Inheritance(Cytoplasmic Inheritance)**

DNA is the universal genetic material. Genes
located in nuclear chromosomes follow
Mendelian inheritance. But certain traits
are governed either by the chloroplast or
mitochondrial genes. This phenomenon is
known as extra nuclear inheritance. It is a kind
of Non-Mendelian inheritance. Since it involves
cytoplasmic organelles such as chloroplast and
mitochondrion that act as inheritance vectors,
it is also called Cytoplasmic inheritance. It is
based on independent, self-replicating extra
chromosomal unit called plasmogene located
in the cytoplasmic organelles, chloroplast and
mitochondrion.

**Chloroplast Inheritance**

It is found in 4 O’ Clock plant (Mirabilis jalapa).
In this, there are two types of variegated leaves
namely dark green leaved plants and pale green
leaved plants. When the pollen of dark green
leaved plant (male) is transferred to the stigma of
pale green leaved plant (female) and pollen of pale
green leaved plant is transferred to the stigma of
dark green leaved plant, the F<sub>1</sub> generation of both
the crosses must be identical as per Mendelian
inheritance. But in the reciprocal cross the F<sub>1</sub> plant
differs from each other. In each cross, the F<sub>1</sub> plant
reveals the character of the plant which is used as female plant.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.20.png )

This inheritance is not through nuclear
gene. It is due to the chloroplast gene found in
the ovum of the female plant which contributes
the cytoplasm during fertilization since the
male gamete contribute only the nucleus but
not cytoplasm.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/botany/unit7/bbf7.21.png )


Recently it has been discovered that
cytoplasmic genetic male sterility is common in
many plant species. This sterility is maintained
by the influence of both nuclear and cytoplasmic
genes. There are commonly two types of
cytoplasm N (normal) and S (sterile). The genes for these are found in mitochondrion. There are  also restores of fertility (Rf) genes. Even though
these genes are nuclear genes, they are distinct
from genetic male sterility genes of other plants.
Because the Rf genes do not have any expression
of their own, unless the sterile cytoplasm is
present. Rf genes are required to restore fertility
in S cytoplasm which is responsible for sterility.


So the combination of N cytoplasm with rfrf
and S cytoplasm with RfRf produces plants
with fertile pollens, while S cytoplasm with rfrf
produces only male sterile plants.

**Summary**

Gregor Johann Mendel, father of Genetics
unraveled the mystery of heredity through his
experiments on garden peas. Mendel’s laws,
analytical and empirical reasoning endure till
now guiding geneticists to study variation. The
monohybrid cross of Mendel proved his particulate
theory of inheritance. In F<sub>2</sub> the alternative traits
were expressed in the ratio of 3 dominant and 1
recessive. The characteristic 3 : 1 segregation is
referred to as Mendelian ratio. Parents transmit
discrete information about the traits to their
offspring which Mendel called it as “factors”. To
test his experimental results Mendel devised a
powerful procedure called the test cross. Test cross
is used to determine the genotype of an individual
when two genes are involved. In Mendel’s dihyrbid
cross, the two pairs of factors were inherited
independently. From the results of dihybrid cross
Mendel gave the Law of Independent Assortment.
Mendel’s dihybrid ratio of 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 with the
representation of two new recombinations
appeared in the progeny, i.e. round green peas
or wrinkled yellow peas. Molecular explanation of Mendel’s gene for monohybrid cross, dihybrid cross were explained. Extension of Mendelian
Genetics was dealt with examples for interaction
among genes. Incomplete dominance is not an
example for blending inheritance. Incomplete
dominance exhibits a phenotypic heterozygote
intermediate between the two homozygous. In
plants codominance can be demonstrated by the
methods of electrophoresis or chromatography
for protein or flavonoid substances. Lethal genes
with an example are explained. Pleiotropy a single
gene which affects multiple traits was explained
with an example of Pisum sativum. Dominant
epistatis in summer squash with 12 : 3 : 1 ratio was
discussed. Polygenic inheritance is an example
for inheritance of continuous traits which is
compatible with Mendel’s laws. The inheritance
of mitochondrial and chloroplast genes were
explained with examples which does not follow
the rules of nuclear genes.
