One of the essential features of all living things
on the earth is reproduction. Reproduction is a
vital process for the existence of a species and it
also brings suitable changes through variation in
the offsprings for their survival on earth. Plant
reproduction is important not only for its own
survival but also for the continuation and existence
of all other organisms since the latter directly or
indirectly depend on plants. Reproduction also
plays an important role in evolution.


In this unit let us learn in detail about
reproduction in plants.


Basically reproduction occurring in
organisms fall under **two major** categories


1. Asexual reproduction
2. Sexual reproduction

**1.1 Asexual Reproduction**

The reproduction method which helps
to perpetuate its own species without the
involvement of gametes is referred to as asexual
reproduction. From Unit I of Class XI we
know that reproduction is one of the attributes
of living things and the different types of
reproduction have also been discussed. Lower
plants, fungi and animals show different methods
of asexual reproduction. Some of the methods
include, formation of Conidia (*Aspergillus*
and **Penicillium*); Budding (*Yeast* and *Hydra*);
Fragmentation (*Spirogyra*); production of
Gemma (*Marchantia*); Regeneration (*Planaria*)
and Binary fission (*Bacteria*) (Refer chapter 1 of
Unit I of class XI). The individuals formed by
this method is morphologically and genetically
identical and are called **clones**. Higher plants
also reproduce asexually by different methods
which are given below:

## 1.2 Vegetative reproduction


### 1.2.1 Natural methods

Natural vegetative reproduction is a form of
asexual reproduction in which a bud grows
and develops into a new plant. The buds may
be formed in organs such as root, stem and
leaf. At some stage, the new plant gets detached
from the parent plant and starts to develop
into a new plant. Some of the organs involved
in the vegetative reproduction also serve as the
organs of storage and perennation. The unit of
reproductive structure used in propagation is
called **reproductive propagules** or **diaspores**.
Some of the organs that help in vegetative
reproduction are given in Figure 1.1

### A. Vegetative reproduction in root


The roots of some plants develop vegetative or
adventitious buds on them. Example *Murraya*,
*Dalbergia* and *Millingtonia*. Some tuberous
adventitious roots apart from developing buds
also store food. Example *Ipomoea* batatus
and *Dahlia*. Roots possessing buds become
detached from the parent plant and grow into
independent plant under suitable condition.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/3.png )


### B. Vegetative reproduction in stem


From the Unit 3 of class XI (Vegetative
morphology) you are familiar with the structure
of various underground stem and sub aerial stem
modifications. These include rhizome (*Musa*
*paradisiaca*, *Zingiber officinale* and *Curcuma*
*longa*); corm (*Amorphophallus* and *Colocasia*);
tuber (*Solanum tuberosum*); bulb(*Allium* *cepa*
and *Lilium*) runner (*Centella asiatica*); stolon
(*Mentha*, and *Fragaria*); offset (*Pistia*, and
*Eichhornia*); sucker (*Chrysanthemum*) and
bulbils (*Dioscorea and Agave*). The axillary buds
from the nodes of rhizome and eyes of tuber give
rise to new plants.


### C. Vegetative reproduction in leaf


In some plants adventitious buds are developed
on their leaves. When they are detached
from the parent plant they grow into new
individual plants. Examples: *Bryophyllum*,
*Scilla*, and *Begonia*. In *Bryophyllum*, the
leaf is succulent and notched on its margin.
Adventious buds develop at these notches and
are called **epiphyllous buds**. They develop
into new plants forming a root system and
become independent plants when the leaf gets
decayed. *Scilla* is a bulbous plant and grows
in sandy soils. The foliage leaves are long and
narrow and epiphyllous buds develop at their
tips. These buds develop into new plants when
they touch the soil.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/4.png )


**Advantages of natural vegetative**
**reproduction**

• Only one parent is required for propagation.

• The new individual plants produced are
genetically identical.

• In some plants, this enables to spread
rapidly. Example: Spinifex

• Horticulturists and farmers utilize these
organs of natural vegetative reproduction
for cultivation and to harvest plants in
large scale.

**Disadvantage of natural vegetative**
**reproduction**

• New plants produced have no genetic
variation.


### 1.2.2 Artificial Methods

Apart from the above mentioned natural methods
of vegetative reproduction, a number of methods
are used in agriculture and horticulture to
propagate plants from their parts. Such methods
are said to be artificial propagation. Some of the
artificial propagation methods have been used by
man for a long time and are called **conventional**
**methods**. Now-a-days, technology is being used
for propagation to produce large number of plants
in a short period of time. Such methods are said
to be **modern methods**.


#### A. Conventional methods

The common methods of conventional
propagation are cutting, grafting and layering.



**a. Cutting**:

 It is the method of producing a new
plant by cutting the plant parts such as root, stem
and leaf from the parent plant. The cut part is placed
in a suitable medium for growth. It produces root
and grows into a new plant. Depending upon the
part used it is called as root cutting (*Malus*), stem
cutting (*Hibiscus*, *Bougainvillea* and *Moringa*) and
leaf cutting (*Begonia*, *Bryophyllum*). Stem cutting
is widely used for propagation.



**b.Grafting**: 

In this, parts of two different plants
are joined so that they continue to grow as one
plant. Of the two plants, the plant which is in
contact with the soil is called **stock** and the
plant used for grafting is called **scion** (Figure
1.2 a). Examples are Citrus, Mango and Apple.
There are different types of grafting based on the
method of uniting the scion and stock. They are
bud grafting, approach grafting, tongue grafting,
crown grafting and wedge grafting.


**i. Bud grafting**: 

A T- shaped incision is made
in the stock and the bark is lifted. The scion bud
with little wood is placed in the incision beneath
the bark and properly bandaged with a tape.



**ii. Approach grafting**: 

In this method both
the scion and stock remain rooted. The stock
is grown in a pot and it is brought close to
the scion. Both of them should have the same
thickness. A small slice is cut from both and the
cut surfaces are brought near and tied together
and held by a tape. After 1-4 weeks the tip of
the stock and base of the scion are cut off and
detached and grown in a separate pot. 

**iii. Tongue grafting**


A scion and stock having the same thickness is
cut obliquely and the scion is fit into the stock
and bound with a tape.


**iv. Crown grafting.**


When the stock is large in size scions are cut
into wedge shape and are inserted on the slits
or clefts of the stock and fixed in position
using graft wax.


**v. Wedge grafting**


In this method a slit is made in the stock or the
bark is cut. A twig of scion is inserted and tightly
bound so that the cambium of the two is joined.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/5.png )

**c. Layering:**

 In this method, the stem of
a parent plant is allowed to develop roots
while still intact. When the root develops,


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/6.png )

the rooted part is cut and planted to grow as
a new plant. Examples: *Ixora* and *Jasminum*.
Mound layering and Air layering are few types
of layering (Figure 1.2 b). 

**i**. **Mound** **layering**:

 This method is applied for
the plants having flexible branches. The lower
branch with leaves is bent to the ground and
part of the stem is buried in the soil and tip of
the branch is exposed above the soil. After the
roots emerge from the part of the stem buried
in the soil, a cut is made in parent plant so that
the buried part grow into a new plant.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/7.png )


**ii**. **Air** **layering**: 

In this method the stem is
girdled at nodal region and hormones are
applied to this region which promotes rooting.
This portion is covered with damp or moist soil
using a polythene sheet. Roots emerge in these branches after 2-4 months. Such branches are
removed from the parent plant and grown in a
separate pot or ground.

**Advantages of conventional methods**


• The plants produced are genetically uniform.


• Many plants can be produced quickly by
this method.


• Some plants produce little or no seeds;
in others, the seeds produced do not
germinate. In such cases, plants can be
produced in a short period by this method.


• Some plants can be propagated more
economically by vegetative propagation.
Example: *Solanum tuberosum*.


• Two different plants with desirable
characters such as disease resistance and
high yield can be grafted and grown as a new
plant with the same desirable characters.

**Disadvantages of conventional methods**


• Use of virus infected plants as parents
produces viral infected new plants.


• Vegetative structures used for propagation
are bulky and so they are difficult to handle
and store.

### 1.3 Sexual Reproduction


In previous classes reproduction in lower plants
like algae and bryophytes was discussed in detail.
Sexual reproduction involves the production
and fusion of male and female gametes. The
former is called gametogenesis and the latter 
is the process of fertilization. Let us recall the
sexual reproduction in algae and bryophytes.
They reproduce by the production of gametes
which may be motile or non motile depending
upon the species. The gametic fusion is of three
types (Isogamy, Anisogamy and Oogamy). In
algae external fertilization takes place whereas
in higher plants internal fertilization occurs.


#### Flower
A flower is viewed in multidimensional
perspectives from time immemorial. It is an
inspirational tool for the poets. It is a decorative
material for all the celebrations. In Tamil
literature the five lands are denoted by different
flowers. The flags of some countries are
embedded with flowers. Flowers are used in the
preparation of perfumes. For a Morphologist,
a flower is a highly condensed shoot meant for
reproduction. As you have already learned about
the parts of a flower in Unit II of Class XI, let us
recall the parts of a flower. A Flower possesses
four whorls- Calyx, Corolla, Androecium and
Gynoecium. Androecium and Gynoecium
are essential organs(Figure 1.3). The process
or changes involved in sexual reproduction of
higher plants include three stages .They are Prefertilization, Fertilization and Post fertilization
changes. Let us discuss these events in detail.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/8.png )


#### 1.4 Pre-fertilization: structures and events


The hormonal and structural changes
in plant lead to the differentiation and
development of floral primordium

The structures and events involved in prefertilization are given below 


#### 1.4.1 Male Reproductive part -Androecium

Androecium is made up of stamens. Each
stamen possesses an anther and a filament.
Anther bears pollen grains which represent
the male gametophyte. In this chapter we
shall discuss the structure and development of
anther in detail.  

#### Development of anther:

 A very young
anther develops as a homogenous mass of
cells surrounded by an epidermis. During
its development, the anther assumes a fourlobed structure. In each lobe, a row or a few
rows of hypodermal cells becomes enlarged
with conspicuous nuclei. This functions as
archesporium. The archesporial cells divide
by periclinal divisions to form primary
parietal cells towards the epidermis and
primary sporogenous cells towards the inner
side of the anther. The primary parietal cells
undergo a series of periclinal and anticlinal
division and form 2-5 layers of anther walls
composed of endothecium, middle layers and
tapetum, from periphery to centre. 


**Microsporogenesis**: 

The stages involved
in the formation of haploid microspores from
diploid microspore mother cell through meiosis
is called **Microsporogenesis**. The primary
sporogeneous cells directly, or may undergo
a few mitotic divisions to form **sporogenous**
**tissue**. The last generation of sporogenous tissue
functions as microspore mother cells. Each
microspore mother cell divides meiotically
to form a tetrad of four haploid microspores
(microspore tetrad). Microspores soon separate
from one another and remain free in the anther
locule and develop into pollen grains. The stages
in the development of microsporangia is given in
Figure 1.4. In some plants, all the microspores in
a microsporangium remain held together called
pollinium. Example: *Calotropis*. Pollinia are attached to a clamp or clip like sticky structure
called **corpusculum**. The filamentous or thread
like part arising from each pollinium is called
**retinaculum**. The whole structure looks like
inverted letter 'Y' and is called **translator**


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/9.png )



#### T.S. of Mature anther


Transverse section of mature anther reveals
the presence of anther cavity surrounded by an
anther wall. It is bilobed, each lobe having 2 theca
(dithecous). A typical anther is tetrasporangiate.
The T.S. of Mature anther is given in Figure 1.5.


**1. Anther wall**


The mature anther wall consists of the
following layers **a. Epidermis** **b. Endothecium**
**c. Middle layers d. Tapetum.**


**a. Epidermis**: 

It is single layered and protective
in function. The cells undergo repeated
anticlinal divisions to cope up with the rapidly
enlarging internal tissues.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/10.png )

**b.Endothecium**: 

It is generally a single layer
of radially elongated cells found below the
epidermis. The inner tangential wall develops
bands (sometimes radial walls also) of α cellulose
(sometimes also slightly lignified). The cells are
**hygroscopic**. In the anthers of aquatic plants, 
saprophytes, cleistogamous flowers and extreme
parasites endothecial differentiation is absent.
The cells along the junction of the two sporangia
of an anther lobe lack these thickenings. This
region is called **stomium**. This region along with
the hygroscopic nature of endothecium helps in
the dehiscence of anther at maturity.   


**c. Middle layers**:

 Two to three layers of
cells next to endothecium constitute middle
layers. They are generally ephemeral. They
disintegrate or get crushed during maturity.


**d. Tapetum**: 

It is the innermost layer of anther
wall and attains its maximum development at the
tetrad stage of microsporogenesis. It is derived
partly from the peripheral wall layer and partly
from the connective tissue of the anther lining
the anther locule. Thus, the tapetum is dual in
origin. It nourishes the developing sporogenous
tissue, microspore mother cells and microspores.
The cells of the tapetum may remain uninucleate
or may contain more than one nucleus or
the nucleus may become polyploid. It also
contributes to the wall materials, sporopollenin,
pollenkitt, tryphine and number of proteins that
control incompatibility reaction .Tapetum also
controls the fertility or sterility of the microspores
or pollen grains.


There are two types of tapetum based on its
behaviour. They are:
