One of the essential features of all living things
on the earth is reproduction. Reproduction is a
vital process for the existence of a species and it
also brings suitable changes through variation in
the offsprings for their survival on earth. Plant
reproduction is important not only for its own
survival but also for the continuation and existence
of all other organisms since the latter directly or
indirectly depend on plants. Reproduction also
plays an important role in evolution.


In this unit let us learn in detail about
reproduction in plants.


Basically reproduction occurring in
organisms fall under **two major** categories


1. Asexual reproduction
2. Sexual reproduction

**1.1 Asexual Reproduction**

The reproduction method which helps
to perpetuate its own species without the
involvement of gametes is referred to as asexual
reproduction. From Unit I of Class XI we
know that reproduction is one of the attributes
of living things and the different types of
reproduction have also been discussed. Lower
plants, fungi and animals show different methods
of asexual reproduction. Some of the methods
include, formation of Conidia (*Aspergillus*
and **Penicillium*); Budding (*Yeast* and *Hydra*);
Fragmentation (*Spirogyra*); production of
Gemma (*Marchantia*); Regeneration (*Planaria*)
and Binary fission (*Bacteria*) (Refer chapter 1 of
Unit I of class XI). The individuals formed by
this method is morphologically and genetically
identical and are called **clones**. Higher plants
also reproduce asexually by different methods
which are given below:

## 1.2 Vegetative reproduction


### 1.2.1 Natural methods

Natural vegetative reproduction is a form of
asexual reproduction in which a bud grows
and develops into a new plant. The buds may
be formed in organs such as root, stem and
leaf. At some stage, the new plant gets detached
from the parent plant and starts to develop
into a new plant. Some of the organs involved
in the vegetative reproduction also serve as the
organs of storage and perennation. The unit of
reproductive structure used in propagation is
called **reproductive propagules** or **diaspores**.
Some of the organs that help in vegetative
reproduction are given in Figure 1.1

### A. Vegetative reproduction in root


The roots of some plants develop vegetative or
adventitious buds on them. Example *Murraya*,
*Dalbergia* and *Millingtonia*. Some tuberous
adventitious roots apart from developing buds
also store food. Example *Ipomoea* batatus
and *Dahlia*. Roots possessing buds become
detached from the parent plant and grow into
independent plant under suitable condition.

### B. Vegetative reproduction in stem


From the Unit 3 of class XI (Vegetative
morphology) you are familiar with the structure
of various underground stem and sub aerial stem
modifications. These include rhizome (*Musa*
*paradisiaca*, *Zingiber officinale* and *Curcuma*
*longa*); corm (*Amorphophallus* and *Colocasia*);
tuber (*Solanum tuberosum*); bulb(*Allium* *cepa*
and *Lilium*) runner (*Centella asiatica*); stolon
(*Mentha*, and *Fragaria*); offset (*Pistia*, and
*Eichhornia*); sucker (*Chrysanthemum*) and
bulbils (*Dioscorea and Agave*). The axillary buds
from the nodes of rhizome and eyes of tuber give
rise to new plants.


### C. Vegetative reproduction in leaf


In some plants adventitious buds are developed
on their leaves. When they are detached
from the parent plant they grow into new
individual plants. Examples: *Bryophyllum*,
*Scilla*, and *Begonia*. In *Bryophyllum*, the
leaf is succulent and notched on its margin.
Adventious buds develop at these notches and
are called **epiphyllous buds**. They develop
into new plants forming a root system and
become independent plants when the leaf gets
decayed. *Scilla* is a bulbous plant and grows
in sandy soils. The foliage leaves are long and
narrow and epiphyllous buds develop at their
tips. These buds develop into new plants when
they touch the soil.

**Advantages of natural vegetative**
**reproduction**

• Only one parent is required for propagation.

• The new individual plants produced are
genetically identical.

• In some plants, this enables to spread
rapidly. Example: Spinifex

• Horticulturists and farmers utilize these
organs of natural vegetative reproduction
for cultivation and to harvest plants in
large scale.

**Disadvantage of natural vegetative**
**reproduction**

• New plants produced have no genetic
variation.


### 1.2.2 Artificial Methods

Apart from the above mentioned natural methods
of vegetative reproduction, a number of methods
are used in agriculture and horticulture to
propagate plants from their parts. Such methods
are said to be artificial propagation. Some of the
artificial propagation methods have been used by
man for a long time and are called **conventional**
**methods**. Now-a-days, technology is being used
for propagation to produce large number of plants
in a short period of time. Such methods are said
to be **modern methods**.
