One of the essential features of all living things
on the earth is reproduction. Reproduction is a
vital process for the existence of a species and it
also brings suitable changes through variation in
the offsprings for their survival on earth. Plant
reproduction is important not only for its own
survival but also for the continuation and existence
of all other organisms since the latter directly or
indirectly depend on plants. Reproduction also
plays an important role in evolution.


In this unit let us learn in detail about
reproduction in plants.


Basically reproduction occurring in
organisms fall under **two major** categories


1. Asexual reproduction
2. Sexual reproduction



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/1.png )


**1.1 Asexual Reproduction**

The reproduction method which helps
to perpetuate its own species without the
involvement of gametes is referred to as asexual
reproduction. From Unit I of Class XI we
know that reproduction is one of the attributes
of living things and the different types of
reproduction have also been discussed. Lower
plants, fungi and animals show different methods
of asexual reproduction. Some of the methods
include, formation of Conidia (*Aspergillus*
and **Penicillium*); Budding (*Yeast* and *Hydra*);
Fragmentation (*Spirogyra*); production of
Gemma (*Marchantia*); Regeneration (*Planaria*)
and Binary fission (*Bacteria*) (Refer chapter 1 of
Unit I of class XI). The individuals formed by
this method is morphologically and genetically
identical and are called **clones**. Higher plants
also reproduce asexually by different methods
which are given below:

## 1.2 Vegetative reproduction

### 1.2.1 Natural methods

Natural vegetative reproduction is a form of
asexual reproduction in which a bud grows
and develops into a new plant. The buds may
be formed in organs such as root, stem and
leaf. At some stage, the new plant gets detached
from the parent plant and starts to develop
into a new plant. Some of the organs involved
in the vegetative reproduction also serve as the
organs of storage and perennation. The unit of
reproductive structure used in propagation is
called **reproductive propagules** or **diaspores**.
Some of the organs that help in vegetative
reproduction are given in Figure 1.1

### A. Vegetative reproduction in root


The roots of some plants develop vegetative or
adventitious buds on them. Example *Murraya*,
*Dalbergia* and *Millingtonia*. Some tuberous
adventitious roots apart from developing buds
also store food. Example *Ipomoea* batatus
and *Dahlia*. Roots possessing buds become
detached from the parent plant and grow into
independent plant under suitable condition.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/2.png )

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/3.png )


### B. Vegetative reproduction in stem


From the Unit 3 of class XI (Vegetative
morphology) you are familiar with the structure
of various underground stem and sub aerial stem
modifications. These include rhizome (*Musa*
*paradisiaca*, *Zingiber officinale* and *Curcuma*
*longa*); corm (*Amorphophallus* and *Colocasia*);
tuber (*Solanum tuberosum*); bulb(*Allium* *cepa*
and *Lilium*) runner (*Centella asiatica*); stolon
(*Mentha*, and *Fragaria*); offset (*Pistia*, and
*Eichhornia*); sucker (*Chrysanthemum*) and
bulbils (*Dioscorea and Agave*). The axillary buds
from the nodes of rhizome and eyes of tuber give
rise to new plants.


### C. Vegetative reproduction in leaf


In some plants adventitious buds are developed
on their leaves. When they are detached
from the parent plant they grow into new
individual plants. Examples: *Bryophyllum*,
*Scilla*, and *Begonia*. In *Bryophyllum*, the
leaf is succulent and notched on its margin.
Adventious buds develop at these notches and
are called **epiphyllous buds**. They develop
into new plants forming a root system and
become independent plants when the leaf gets
decayed. *Scilla* is a bulbous plant and grows
in sandy soils. The foliage leaves are long and
narrow and epiphyllous buds develop at their
tips. These buds develop into new plants when
they touch the soil.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/4.png )


**Advantages of natural vegetative**
**reproduction**

• Only one parent is required for propagation.

• The new individual plants produced are
genetically identical.

• In some plants, this enables to spread
rapidly. Example: Spinifex

• Horticulturists and farmers utilize these
organs of natural vegetative reproduction
for cultivation and to harvest plants in
large scale.

**Disadvantage of natural vegetative**
**reproduction**

• New plants produced have no genetic
variation.


### 1.2.2 Artificial Methods

Apart from the above mentioned natural methods
of vegetative reproduction, a number of methods
are used in agriculture and horticulture to
propagate plants from their parts. Such methods
are said to be artificial propagation. Some of the
artificial propagation methods have been used by
man for a long time and are called **conventional**
**methods**. Now-a-days, technology is being used
for propagation to produce large number of plants
in a short period of time. Such methods are said
to be **modern methods**.


#### A. Conventional methods

The common methods of conventional
propagation are cutting, grafting and layering.



**a. Cutting**:

 It is the method of producing a new
plant by cutting the plant parts such as root, stem
and leaf from the parent plant. The cut part is placed
in a suitable medium for growth. It produces root
and grows into a new plant. Depending upon the
part used it is called as root cutting (*Malus*), stem
cutting (*Hibiscus*, *Bougainvillea* and *Moringa*) and
leaf cutting (*Begonia*, *Bryophyllum*). Stem cutting
is widely used for propagation.



**b.Grafting**: 

In this, parts of two different plants
are joined so that they continue to grow as one
plant. Of the two plants, the plant which is in
contact with the soil is called **stock** and the
plant used for grafting is called **scion** (Figure
1.2 a). Examples are Citrus, Mango and Apple.
There are different types of grafting based on the
method of uniting the scion and stock. They are
bud grafting, approach grafting, tongue grafting,
crown grafting and wedge grafting.


**i. Bud grafting**: 

A T- shaped incision is made
in the stock and the bark is lifted. The scion bud
with little wood is placed in the incision beneath
the bark and properly bandaged with a tape.



**ii. Approach grafting**: 

In this method both
the scion and stock remain rooted. The stock
is grown in a pot and it is brought close to
the scion. Both of them should have the same
thickness. A small slice is cut from both and the
cut surfaces are brought near and tied together
and held by a tape. After 1-4 weeks the tip of
the stock and base of the scion are cut off and
detached and grown in a separate pot. 

**iii. Tongue grafting**


A scion and stock having the same thickness is
cut obliquely and the scion is fit into the stock
and bound with a tape.


**iv. Crown grafting.**


When the stock is large in size scions are cut
into wedge shape and are inserted on the slits
or clefts of the stock and fixed in position
using graft wax.


**v. Wedge grafting**


In this method a slit is made in the stock or the
bark is cut. A twig of scion is inserted and tightly
bound so that the cambium of the two is joined.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/5.png )

**c. Layering:**

 In this method, the stem of
a parent plant is allowed to develop roots
while still intact. When the root develops,


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/6.png )

the rooted part is cut and planted to grow as
a new plant. Examples: *Ixora* and *Jasminum*.
Mound layering and Air layering are few types
of layering (Figure 1.2 b). 

**i**. **Mound** **layering**:

 This method is applied for
the plants having flexible branches. The lower
branch with leaves is bent to the ground and
part of the stem is buried in the soil and tip of
the branch is exposed above the soil. After the
roots emerge from the part of the stem buried
in the soil, a cut is made in parent plant so that
the buried part grow into a new plant.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/7.png )


**ii**. **Air** **layering**: 

In this method the stem is
girdled at nodal region and hormones are
applied to this region which promotes rooting.
This portion is covered with damp or moist soil
using a polythene sheet. Roots emerge in these branches after 2-4 months. Such branches are
removed from the parent plant and grown in a
separate pot or ground.

**Advantages of conventional methods**


• The plants produced are genetically uniform.


• Many plants can be produced quickly by
this method.


• Some plants produce little or no seeds;
in others, the seeds produced do not
germinate. In such cases, plants can be
produced in a short period by this method.


• Some plants can be propagated more
economically by vegetative propagation.
Example: *Solanum tuberosum*.


• Two different plants with desirable
characters such as disease resistance and
high yield can be grafted and grown as a new
plant with the same desirable characters.

**Disadvantages of conventional methods**


• Use of virus infected plants as parents
produces viral infected new plants.


• Vegetative structures used for propagation
are bulky and so they are difficult to handle
and store.

### 1.3 Sexual Reproduction


In previous classes reproduction in lower plants
like algae and bryophytes was discussed in detail.
Sexual reproduction involves the production
and fusion of male and female gametes. The
former is called gametogenesis and the latter 
is the process of fertilization. Let us recall the
sexual reproduction in algae and bryophytes.
They reproduce by the production of gametes
which may be motile or non motile depending
upon the species. The gametic fusion is of three
types (Isogamy, Anisogamy and Oogamy). In
algae external fertilization takes place whereas
in higher plants internal fertilization occurs.


#### Flower
A flower is viewed in multidimensional
perspectives from time immemorial. It is an
inspirational tool for the poets. It is a decorative
material for all the celebrations. In Tamil
literature the five lands are denoted by different
flowers. The flags of some countries are
embedded with flowers. Flowers are used in the
preparation of perfumes. For a Morphologist,
a flower is a highly condensed shoot meant for
reproduction. As you have already learned about
the parts of a flower in Unit II of Class XI, let us
recall the parts of a flower. A Flower possesses
four whorls- Calyx, Corolla, Androecium and
Gynoecium. Androecium and Gynoecium
are essential organs(Figure 1.3). The process
or changes involved in sexual reproduction of
higher plants include three stages .They are Prefertilization, Fertilization and Post fertilization
changes. Let us discuss these events in detail.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/8.png )


#### 1.4 Pre-fertilization: structures and events


The hormonal and structural changes
in plant lead to the differentiation and
development of floral primordium

The structures and events involved in prefertilization are given below 


#### 1.4.1 Male Reproductive part -Androecium

Androecium is made up of stamens. Each
stamen possesses an anther and a filament.
Anther bears pollen grains which represent
the male gametophyte. In this chapter we
shall discuss the structure and development of
anther in detail.  

#### Development of anther:

 A very young
anther develops as a homogenous mass of
cells surrounded by an epidermis. During
its development, the anther assumes a fourlobed structure. In each lobe, a row or a few
rows of hypodermal cells becomes enlarged
with conspicuous nuclei. This functions as
archesporium. The archesporial cells divide
by periclinal divisions to form primary
parietal cells towards the epidermis and
primary sporogenous cells towards the inner
side of the anther. The primary parietal cells
undergo a series of periclinal and anticlinal
division and form 2-5 layers of anther walls
composed of endothecium, middle layers and
tapetum, from periphery to centre. 


**Microsporogenesis**: 

The stages involved
in the formation of haploid microspores from
diploid microspore mother cell through meiosis
is called **Microsporogenesis**. The primary
sporogeneous cells directly, or may undergo
a few mitotic divisions to form **sporogenous**
**tissue**. The last generation of sporogenous tissue
functions as microspore mother cells. Each
microspore mother cell divides meiotically
to form a tetrad of four haploid microspores
(microspore tetrad). Microspores soon separate
from one another and remain free in the anther
locule and develop into pollen grains. The stages
in the development of microsporangia is given in
Figure 1.4. In some plants, all the microspores in
a microsporangium remain held together called
pollinium. Example: *Calotropis*. Pollinia are attached to a clamp or clip like sticky structure
called **corpusculum**. The filamentous or thread
like part arising from each pollinium is called
**retinaculum**. The whole structure looks like
inverted letter 'Y' and is called **translator**


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/9.png )



#### T.S. of Mature anther


Transverse section of mature anther reveals
the presence of anther cavity surrounded by an
anther wall. It is bilobed, each lobe having 2 theca
(dithecous). A typical anther is tetrasporangiate.
The T.S. of Mature anther is given in Figure 1.5.


**1. Anther wall**


The mature anther wall consists of the
following layers **a. Epidermis** **b. Endothecium**
**c. Middle layers d. Tapetum.**


**a. Epidermis**: 

It is single layered and protective
in function. The cells undergo repeated
anticlinal divisions to cope up with the rapidly
enlarging internal tissues.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/10.png )

**b.Endothecium**: 

It is generally a single layer
of radially elongated cells found below the
epidermis. The inner tangential wall develops
bands (sometimes radial walls also) of α cellulose
(sometimes also slightly lignified). The cells are
**hygroscopic**. In the anthers of aquatic plants, 
saprophytes, cleistogamous flowers and extreme
parasites endothecial differentiation is absent.
The cells along the junction of the two sporangia
of an anther lobe lack these thickenings. This
region is called **stomium**. This region along with
the hygroscopic nature of endothecium helps in
the dehiscence of anther at maturity.   


**c. Middle layers**:

 Two to three layers of
cells next to endothecium constitute middle
layers. They are generally ephemeral. They
disintegrate or get crushed during maturity.


**d. Tapetum**: 

It is the innermost layer of anther
wall and attains its maximum development at the
tetrad stage of microsporogenesis. It is derived
partly from the peripheral wall layer and partly
from the connective tissue of the anther lining
the anther locule. Thus, the tapetum is dual in
origin. It nourishes the developing sporogenous
tissue, microspore mother cells and microspores.
The cells of the tapetum may remain uninucleate
or may contain more than one nucleus or
the nucleus may become polyploid. It also
contributes to the wall materials, sporopollenin,
pollenkitt, tryphine and number of proteins that
control incompatibility reaction .Tapetum also
controls the fertility or sterility of the microspores
or pollen grains.


There are two types of tapetum based on its
behaviour. They are:


**Secretory** **tapetum** 

(parietal/glandular/
cellular): The tapetum retains the original
position and cellular integrity and nourishes
the developing microspores.


**Invasive** **tapetum** (periplasmodial):

 The
cells loose their inner tangential and radial
walls and the protoplast of all tapetal cells
coalesces to form a periplasmodium.


**Functions of Tapetum**:


• It supplies nutrition to the developing
microspores.


• It contributes sporopollenin through
**ubisch bodies** thus plays an important
role in pollen wall formation.

The pollenkitt material is contributed by
tapetal cells and is later transferred to the
pollen surface.


Exine proteins responsible for **‘rejection**
**reaction’** of the stigma are present in the
cavities of the exine. These proteins are
derived from tapetal cells.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/11.png )


**2. Anther Cavity** : The anther cavity is filled with
microspores in young stages or with pollen grains
at maturity. The meiotic division of microspore
mother cells gives rise to microspores which are
haploid in nature.


**3. Connective**: It is the column of sterile tissue
surrounded by the anther lobe. It possesses
vascular tissues. It also contributes to the
inner tapetum.

#### Microspores and pollen grains


Microspores are the immediate product of
meiosis of the microspore mother cell whereas
the pollen grain is derived from the microspore.
The microspores have protoplast surrounded
by a wall which is yet to be fully developed. The
pollen protoplast consists of dense cytoplasm
with a centrally located nucleus. The wall is
differentiated into two layers, namely, inner
layer called **intine** and outer layer called **exine**.
Intine is thin, uniform and is made up of pectin,
hemicellulose, cellulose and callose together
with proteins. Exine is thick and is made up
of cellulose, sporopollenin and pollenkitt. The
exine is not uniform and is thin at certain areas.
When these thin areas are small and round it is
called germ pores or when elongated it is called
furrows. It is associated with germination of
pollen grains. The sporopollenin is generally absent in germ pores.The surface of the exine
is either smooth or sculptured in various
patterns (rod like, grooved, warty, punctuate
etc.) The sculpturing pattern is used in the
plant identification and classification.


Shape of a pollen grain varies from species
to species. It may be globose, ellipsoid, fusiform,
lobed, angular or crescent shaped. The size of the
pollen varies from 10 micrometers in Myosotis
to 200 micrometers in members of the family
Cucurbitaceae and Nyctaginaceae

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/12.png )


Pollenkitt is contributed by the tapetum
and coloured yellow or orange and is chiefly
made of carotenoids or flavonoids. It is an oily
layer forming a thick viscous coating over pollen
surface. It attracts insects and protects damage
from UV radiation.


#### Development of Male gametophyte:


The microspore is the first cell of the male
gametophyte and is haploid. The development
of male gametophyte takes place while they are
still in the microsporangium. The nucleus of the
microspore divides mitotically to form a **vegetative**
and a **generative** nucleus. A wall is laid around the
generative nucleus resulting in the formation of two
unequal cells, a large irregular nucleus bearing with
abundant food reserve called vegetative cell and a
small generative cell. Generally at this 2 celled stage,
the pollens are liberated from the anther. In some
plants the generative cell again undergoes a division
to form two male gametes. The pollen is liberated at
2 celled stage. In 60% of the angiosperms pollen is
liberated in 2 celled stage. Further, the growth of the
male gametophyte occurs only if the pollen reaches
the right stigma. The pollen on reaching the stigma
absorbs moisture and swells.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/13.png )


The intine grows as pollen tube through the germ
pore. In case the pollen is liberated at 2 celled stage the
generative cell divides in the pollen into 2 male cells
(sperms) after reaching the stigma or in the pollen
tube before reaching the embryo sac. The stages
in the development of male gametophyte is given
in Figure 1.6.


#### 1.4.2 Female reproductive part - Gynoecium

The **gynoecium** represents the female
reproductive part of the flower. The word
gynoecium represents one or more pistils of a
flower. The word pistil refers to the ovary, style
and stigma. A pistil is derived from a carpel. The
word ovary represents the part that contains the
ovules. The stigma serves as a landing platform
for pollen grains. The style is an elongated slender
part beneath the stigma. The basal swollen part
of the pistil is the ovary. The ovules are present
inside the ovary cavity (locule)on the placenta
.Gynoecium (carpel) arises as a small papillate
outgrowth of meristematic tissue from the
growing tip of the floral primordium. It grows
actively and soon gets differentiated into ovary,
style and stigma. The ovules or megasporangia
arise from the placenta. The number of ovules in
an ovary may be one (paddy, wheat and mango)
or many (papaya, water melon and orchids).


##### Structure of ovule(Megasporangium):


Ovule is also called megasporangium and is
protected by one or two covering called
**integuments**. A mature ovule consists of a stalk
and a body. The stalk or the **funiculus** (also called
funicle) is present at the base and it attaches the
ovule to the placenta. The point of attachment of
funicle to the body of the ovule is known as
**hilum**. It represents the junction between ovule
and funicle. In an inverted ovule, the funicle is
adnate to the body of the ovule forming a ridge
called **raphe**. The body of the ovule is made up of
a central mass of parenchymatous tissue called
**nucellus** which has large reserve food materials.
The nucellus is enveloped by one or two protective
coverings called **integuments**. Integument
encloses the nucellus completely except at the top
where it is free and forms a pore called micropyle.
The ovule with one or two integuments are said
to be **unitegmic** or **bitegmic** ovules respectively.
The basal region of the body of the ovule where
the nucellus, the integument and the funicle meet
or merge is called as **chalaza**. There is a large,


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/14.png )



oval, sac-like structure in the nucellus toward
the micropylar end called **embryo** **sac** or female
gametophyte. It develops from the functional
megaspore formed within the nucellus. In some
species(unitegmic tenuinucellate) the inner
layer of the integument may become specialized
to perform the nutritive function for the embryo
sac and is called as **endothelium**
or **integumentary** **tapetum** (Example :
Asteraceae). There are two types of ovule based
on the position of the sporogenous cell. If the
sporogenous cell is hypodermal with a single
layer of nucellar tissue around it is called
**tenuinucellate** type. Normally tenuinucellate
ovules have very small nucellus. Ovules with
subhypodermal sporogenous cell is called
**crassinucellate** type. Normally these ovules
have fairly large nucellus. Group of cells found
at the base of the ovule between the chalaza and
embryo sac is called **hypostase** and the thick
-walled cells found above the micropylar end
above the embryo sac is called **epistase**. The
structure of ovule is given in Figure 1.7.



#### Types of Ovules


The ovules are classified into six main types
based on the orientation, form and position
of the micropyle with respect to funicle and
chalaza. Most important ovule types are
orthotropous, anatropous, hemianatropous and
campylotropous. The types of ovule is given in
Figure 1.8.


**Orthotropous**: In this type of ovule, the
micropyle is at the distal end and the micropyle,
the funicle and the chalaza lie in one straight
vertical line. Examples: Piperaceae, Polygonaceae.


**Anatropous**: The body of the ovule becomes
completely inverted so that the micropyle
and funiculus come to lie very close to each
other. This is the common type of ovules
found in dicots and monocots.


**Hemianatropous**: In this, the body of the
ovule is placed transversely and at right angles
to the funicle. Example: Primulaceae.


**Campylotropous**: The body of the ovule at the
micropylar end is curved and more or less bean
shaped. The embryo sac is slightly curved. All the
three, hilum, micropyle and chalaza are adjacent
to one another, with the micropyle oriented
towards the placenta. Example: Leguminosae
In addition to the above main types there are
two more types of ovules they are,



**Amphitropous**: The distance between hilum
and chalaza is less. The curvature of the ovule
leads to horse-shoe shaped nucellus. Example:
some Alismataceae.

**Circinotropous**: Funiculus is very long and
surrounds the ovule. Example: Cactaceae


##### Megasporogenesis


The process of development of a megaspore
from a megaspore mother cell is called
**megasporogenesis**.







As the ovule develops, a single hypodermal
cell in the nucellus becomes enlarged and
functions as **archesporium**. In some plants,
the archesporial cell may directly function as
megaspore mother cell. In others, it may undergo
a transverse division to form outer primary
parietal cell and inner primary sporogenous
cell. The parietal cell may remain undivided or
divide by few periclinal and anticlinal divisions
to embed the primary sporogenous cell deep
into the nucellus. The primary sporogenous
cell functions as a megaspore mother cell. The
megaspore mother cell (MMO) undergoes
meiotic division to form four haploid megaspores.
Based on the number of megaspores that develop
into the Embryo sac, we have three basic types
of development: **monosporic**, **bisporic** and
**tetrasporic**. The megaspores are usually arranged
in a linear tetrad. Of the four megaspores formed,
usually the chalazal one is functional and other
three megaspores degenerate. The functional
megaspore forms the female gametophyte
or embryo sac. This type of development is
called **monosporic** development (Example:
Polygonum). Of the four megaspores formed
if two are involved in Embryo sac formation
the development is called **bisporic** (Example:
Allium). If all the four megaspores are involved
in Embryo sac formation the development
is called **tetrasporic** (Example: Peperomia).
An ovule generally has a single embryo sac.
The development of monosporic embryo sac
(Polygonum type) is given in Figure 1.9.


##### Development of Monosporic embryo sac.

To describe the stages in embryo sac development
and organization the simplest monosporic type
of development is given below.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/15.png )


The functional megaspore is the first cell of
the embryo sac or female gametophyte. The
megaspore elongates along micropylar- chalazal axis. The nucleus undergoes a mitotic division . Wall formation does not follow the nuclear division. A large central vacuole now appears between the two daughter nuclei. The vacuole expands and pushes the nuclei towards the opposite poles of
the embryo sac. Both the nuclei divide twice
mitotically, forming four nuclei at each pole. At
this stage all the eight nuclei are present in a
common cytoplasm (free nuclear division).
After the last nuclear division the cell undergoes
appreciable elongation, assuming a sac-like
appearance. This is followed by cellular
organization of the embryo sac. Of the four
nuclei at the micropylar end of the embryo sac,
three organize into an **egg** **apparatus**, the fourth
one is left free in the cytoplasm of the central
cell as the upper polar nucleus. Three nuclei of
the chalazal end form three **antipodal** **cells**
whereas the fourth one functions as the lower
polar nucleus. Depending on the plant the **2**
**polar** **nuclei** may remain free or may fuse to
form a **secondary** **nucleus** (central cell). The
egg apparatus is made up of a central egg cell
and two synergids, one on each side of the egg
cell. Synergids secrete chemotropic substances


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/16.png )




that help to attract the pollen tube. The special
cellular thickening called filiform apparatus of
synergids help in the absorption, conduction of
nutrients from the nucellus to embryo sac. It
also guides the pollen tube into the egg. Thus, a
7 celled with 8 nuclei embryo sac is formed. The
structure of embryo sac is given in Figure 1.10.



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/17.png )




##### 1.4.3 Pollination


Pollination is a wonderful mechanism which
provides food,
shelter etc., for
the pollinating
animals. Many
plants
are
pollinated
by
a
particular
animal species
and the flowers are modified accordingly and
thus there exists a co-evolution between plants
and animals. Let us imagine if pollination fails.
Do you think there will be any seed and fruit
formation? If not what happens to pollinating
organisms and those that depend on these
pollinating organism for the food? Here lies the
significance of the process of pollination.



The pollen grains produced in the anther
will germinate only when they reach the stigma
of the pistil. The reproductive organs, stamens
and pistil of the flower are spatially separated, a
mechanism which is essential for pollen grains
to reach the stigma is needed. This process of
transfer of pollen grains from the anther to a
stigma of a flower is called **pollination**.







![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/18.png )




**Pollination** is a characteristic feature
spermatophyte
(Gymnosperms
and Angiosperms). Pollination in gymnosperms
is said to be direct as the pollens are deposited
directly on the exposed ovules, whereas in
angiosperms it is said to be indirect, as the
pollens are deposited on the stigma of the
pistil. In majority of angiosperms, the flower
opens and exposes its mature anthers and
stigma for pollination. Such flowers are called
**chasmogamous** and the phenomenon is
**chasmogamy**. In other plants, pollination occurs
without opening and exposing their sex organs.
Such flowers are called **cleistogamous** and the
phenomenon is **cleistogamy**.
Based upon the flower on which the pollen of a
flower reaches, the pollination is classified into
two kinds, namely, **self**-**pollination** (**Autogamy**)
and **cross**-**pollination**(**Allogamy**).


##### A. Self-pollination or Autogamy 
(Greek
Auto = self, gamos = marriage):



According to a majority of Botanists, the
transfer of pollen on the stigma of the same
flower is called **self-pollination or** **Autogamy**.
Self-pollination is possible only in those plants
which bear bisexual flowers. In order to promote
self- pollination the flowers of the plants have
several adaptations or mechanisms. They are:



1. **Cleistogamy**: In cleistogamy (Greek Kleisto
= closed. Gamos = marriage) flowers never open
and expose the reproductive organs and thus the
pollination is carried out within the closed flower.
Commelina, Viola, Oxalis are some examples
for cleistogamous flowers. In Commelina
benghalensis, two types of flowers are produced-
aerial and underground flowers. The aerial
flowers are brightly coloured, chasmogamous
and insect pollinated. The underground flowers
are borne on the subterranean branches of the
rhizome that are dull, cleistogamous and self
pollinated and are not dependent on pollinators
for pollination.(Figure 1.11).



2. **Homogamy**: When the stamens and
stigma of a flower mature at the same time
it is said to be homogamy. It favours self
pollination to occur. Example: *Mirabilis jalapa*,
*Catharanthus roseus*

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/19.png )


3. **Incomplete dichogamy**: In dichogamous
flowers the stamen and stigma of a flower mature at
different time. Sometimes , the time of maturation
of these essential organs overlap so that it becomes
favourable for self-pollination.



##### B. Cross - pollination



It refers to the transfer of pollens on the stigma
of another flower. The cross-pollination is of two
types:




**i. Geitonogamy**: When the pollen deposits on
another flower of the same individual plant, it
is said to be geitonogamy. It usually occurs in
plants which show monoecious condition. It is
functionally cross-pollination but is generally
similar to autogamy because the pollen comes
from same plant.




**ii. Xenogamy**: When the pollen (genetically
different) deposits on another flower of a different
plant of the same species , it is called as xenogamy.
**Contrivances of cross-pollination**



The flowers have several mechanisms that
promote cross-pollination which are also called
**contrivances of cross-pollination or outbreeding**
devices. It includes the following.


1. **Dicliny or Unisexuality**



When the flowers are unisexual only cross-
pollination is possible. There are two types.



i. **Monoecious**: Male and female flowers on
the same plant. Coconut, Bitter gourd. In plants
like castor and maize, autogamy is prevented but
geitonogamy takes place.



ii. **Dioecious** : Male and female flowers on different
plants. Borassus, Carica and phoenix. Here both
autogamy and geitonogamy are prevented.




2. **Monocliny or Bisexuality**



Flowers are bisexual and the special adaptation of
the flowers prevents self-pollination.




i. **Dichogamy**: In bisexual flowers anthers and
stigmas mature at different times, thus checking
self-pollination. It is of two types.




a. **Protandry**: The stamens mature earlier than
the stigmas of the flowers. Examples: Helianthus,
Clerodendrum (Figure 1.12 a).




b. **Protogyny**: The stigmas mature earlier than
the stamens of the flower. Examples: Scrophularia
nodosa and Aristolochia bracteata (Figure1.12b)



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/20.png )





**ii. Herkogamy**: In bisexual flowers the
essential organs, the stamens and stigmas, are
arranged in such a way that self-pollination 
becomes impossible. For example in Gloriosa
superba, the style is reflexed away from the
stamens and in Hibiscus the stigmas project far above the stamens (Figure 1.13).



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/21.png )




**iii. Heterostyly:** Some plants produce two
or three different forms of flowers that are
different in their length of stamens and style.
Pollination will take place only between organs
of the same length.(Figure 1.14)




**a. Distyly**: The plant produces two forms
of flowers, Pin or long style, long stigmatic
papillae, short stamens and small pollen grains;
Thrum-eyed or short style, small stigmatic
papillae, long stamens and large pollen grains.
Example: *Primula* (Figure 1.14a). The stigma of
the Thrum-eyed flowers and the anther of the
pin lie in same level to bring out pollination.
Similarly the anther of Thrum-eyed and stigma
of pin ones is found in same height. This helps
in effective pollination.



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/22.png )




**b. Tristyly**: The plant produces three kinds of
flowers, with respect to the length of the style
and stamens. Here,the pollen from flowers of
one type can pollinate only the other two types
but not their own type. Example : *Lythrum*
(Figure 1.14b).


**iv. Self sterility/ Self- incompatibility**: In
some plants, when the pollen grain of a flower
reaches the stigma of the same, it is unable to
germinate or prevented to germinate on its
own stigma. Examples: *Abutilon, Passiflora.* It
is a genetic mechanism.






##### Agents of pollination




Pollination is effected by many agents like
wind, water, insects etc. On the basis of the
agents that bring about pollination, the mode
of pollination is divided into abiotic and biotic.
The latter type is used by majority of plants.




**Abiotic agents**



1. Anemophily - pollination by Wind



2. Hydrophily - pollination by Water




**Biotic agents**



1. Zoophily



Zoophily refers to pollination through animals
and pollination through insects is called
Entomophily.







1. **Anemophily**: Pollination by wind. The wind
pollinated flowers are called **anemophilous**.
The wind pollinated plants are generally
situated in wind exposed regions. Anemophily
is a chance event. Therefore, the pollen may
not reach the target flower effectively and are
wasted during the transit from one flower
to another. The common examples of wind
pollinated flowers are - grasses, sugarcane,
bamboo, coconut, palm, maize etc.,




**Anemophilous plants have the following**
**characteristic features:**




• The flowers are produced in pendulous,
catkin-like or spike inflorescence.





• The axis of inflorescence elongates so that the flowers are brought well above the leaves.


• The perianth is absent or highly reduced.


• The flowers are small, inconspicuous,
colourless, not scented, do not secrete nectar.



• The stamens are numerous, filaments are
long, exerted and versatile.



• Anthers produce enormous quantities of
pollen grains compared to number of ovules
available for pollination. They are minute,
light and dry so that they can be carried to
long distances by wind.



• In some plants anthers burst violently and
release the pollen into the air. Example:
Urtica.



• Stigmas are comparatively large, protruding,
sometimes branched and feathery, adapted
to catch the pollen grains. Generally single
ovule is present.



• Plant produces flowers before the new leaves
appear, so the pollen can be carried without
hindrance of leaves.



**Pollination in Maize (Zea mays)**: The maize
is monoecious and unisexual. The male
inflorescence (tassel) is borne terminally and
female inflorescence (cob) laterally at lower
levels. Maize pollens are large and heavy and
cannot be carried by light breeze. However,
the mild wind shakes the male inflorescence to
release the pollen which falls vertically below.
The female inflorescence has long stigma (silk)
measuring upto 23 cm in length, which projects
beyond leaves. The pollens drop from the tassel
is caught by the stigma (Figure 1.15).


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/23.png )



**2. Hydrophily**: Pollination by water is called
hydrophily and the flowers pollinated by water are
said to be **hydrophilous** (Example: Vallisneria,
Hydrilla). Though there are a number of aquatic
plants, only in few plants pollination takes place
by water. The floral envelop of hydrophilous
plants are reduced or absent. In water plants
like Eichhornia and water lilly pollination takes
place through wind or by insects. There are
two types of hydrophily, Epihydrophily and
Hypohydrophily. In most of the hydrophilous
flowers, the pollen grains possesses mucilage
covering which protects them from wetting.



**a. Epihydrophily**: Pollination occurs at the
water level. Examples: *Vallisneria spiralis*,
*Elodea*.




**Pollination in *Vallisneria spiralis***: It is a
dioecious, submerged and rooted hydrophyte.
The female plant bears solitary flowers which rise
to the surface of water level using a long coiled
stalk at the time of pollination. A small cup
shaped depression is formed around the female
flower on the surface of the water. The male plant
produces male flowers which get detached and
float on the surface of the water. As soon as a
male flowers comes in contact with the female
flower and pollination takes place, Stalk of the
female flower coils and goes under water where
fruits are produced. (Figure 1.16).


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/24.png )


**b. Hypohydrophily**:
Pollination
occurs
inside the water. Examples: *Zostera marina* and
*Ceratophyllum*.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/25.png )


**3. Zoophily**: Pollination by the agency of animals
is called zoophily and flowers are said to be
zoophilous. Animals that bring about pollination
may be birds, bats, snails and insects. Of these,
insects are well adapted to bring pollination.
Larger animals like primates (lemurs), arboreal
rodents, reptiles (gecko lizard and garden lizard)
have also been reported as pollinators.



**A. Ornithophily:** Pollination by birds is called
Ornithophily. Some common plants that are
pollinated by birds are *Erythrina, Bombax*,
*Syzygium*, *Bignonia*, *Sterlitzia* etc., Humming
birds, sun birds, and honey eaters are some
of the birds which regularly visit flowers and
bring about pollination.




**The ornithophilous flowers have**
**following characteristic features**:


•  The flowers are usually large in size.


•  The flowes are tubular, cup shaped or urn-
shaped.



•  The flowers are brightly coloured, red,
scarlet, pink, orange, blue and yellow which
attracts the birds


•  The flowers are scentless and produce nectar
in large quantities. Pollen and nectar form
the floral rewards for the birds visiting the flower.



•  The floral parts are tough and leathery to
withstand the powerful impact of the visitors.




**B. Cheiropterophily**: Pollination carried out
by bats is called cheiropterophily. Some of the
common cheiropterophilous plants are *Kigelia*
*africana*, *Adansonia digitata*, etc.,




**C. Malacophily**: Pollination by slugs and
snails is called malacophily. Some plants of
Araceae are pollinated by snails. Water snails
crawling among *Lemna* pollinate them.




![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/26.png )


**D. Entomophily**: Pollination by insects is
called **Entomophily**. Pollination by ant is called
**myrmecophily**. Insects that are well adapted to bring pollination are bees, moths, butterflies
flies, wasps and beetles. Of the insects, beesare the main flower visitors and dominant
pollinators. Insects are chief pollinating agents
and majority of angiosperms are adapted
for insect pollination. It is the most common type  of pollination.







**The characteristic features of entomo­philous flowers are as follows:**


• Flowers are generally large or if small they are aggregated in dense inflorescence.Example: Asteraceae flowers.


• Flowers are brightly coloured.The adjacent part of the flowers may also be brightly coloured to attract insect. For example in *Poinsettia* and *Bougainvillea* the *bracts* become coloured.

• Flowers are scented and produce nectar.

• Flowers in which there is no secretion of nectar, the pollen is either consumed as
nectar, the pollen is either consumed as food or used in building up of its hive by the
honeybees. Pollen and nectar are the floral rewards for the visitors.


• Flowers pollinated by flies and beetles produce foul odour to attract pollinators.


• In some flowers juicy cells are present which are pierced and the contents are sucked by
the insects.



**Pollination in Salvia (Lever mechanism):**


The flower is protandrous and the corolla is
NT
bilabiate with 2 stamens. A lever mechanis
helps in pollination. Each anther has an upper
fertile lobe and lower sterile lobe which is
separated by a long connective which helps
the anthers to swing freely. When a bee visits
a flower,
it sits on the lower lip which acts as a
platform. It enters the flower to suck the nectar
by pushing its head into the corolla. During the
entry of the bee into the flower the body
strikes against the sterile end of the connective.
This makes the fertile part of the stamen to
descend and strike at the back of the bee.
The pollen gets deposited on the back of the
bee. When it visits another flower, the pollen
gets rubbed against the stigma and completes
the act of pollination in *Salvia* (Figure 1.17).


Some of the other interesting pollination
mechanisms found in plants are a) Trap
mechanism (*Aristolochia*);Pit fall mechanism
(*Arum*);Clip
or
translator
mechanism (*Asclepiadaceae*) and piston mechanism (*Papilionaceae*).


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/27.png )



#### 1.5 Fertilization

The fusion of male and female
gamete is called **fertilization**.
**Double fertilization** is seen in
angiosperms.



**Events of fertilization**



The stages involved in double
fertilization are:- germination
of pollen to form pollen tube
in the stigma; growth of pollen
tube in the style; direction
of pollen tube towards the micropyle of the
ovule; entry of the pollen tube into one of the
synergids of the embryo sac, discharge of
male gametes; syngamy and triple fusion. The
events from pollen deposition on the stigma to
the entry of pollen tube in to the ovule is called
**pollen- pistil interaction**. It is a dynamic
process which involves recognition of pollen
and to promote or inhibit its germination and
growth.



##### Pollen on the stigma



In nature, a variety of pollens fall on the receptive
stigma, but all of them do not germinate and
bring out fertilization. The receptive surface
of the stigma receives the pollen. If the pollen
is compatible with the stigma it germinates to
form a tube. This is facilitated by the stigmatic
fluid in **wet stigma** and pellicle in **dry stigma**.
These two also decide the incompatibility and compatibility of the pollen through **recognition**-
**rejection protein reaction** between the pollen
and stigma surface. Sexual incompatibility may
exist between different species (interspecific)
or between members of the same species
(intraspecific).The latter is called self-
incompatibility. The first visible change in the
pollen, soon after it lands on stigma is hydration.
The pollen wall proteins are released from the
surface. During the germination of pollen its
entire content moves into the pollen tube. The
growth is restricted to the tip of the tube and
all the cytoplasmic contents move to the tip
region. The remaining part of the pollen tube
is occupied by a vacuole which is cut off from
the tip by callose plug. The extreme tip of pollen
tube appears hemispherical and transparent
when viewed through the microscope. This
is called **cap block**. As soon as the cap block
disappear the growth of the pollen tube stops.



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/28.png )


##### Pollen tube in the style


After the germination the pollen tube enters into
the style from the stigma. The growth of the pollen
tube in the style depends on the type of style.



**Types of style**



There are three types of style a) Hollow or
open style b)solid style or closed style c) semi-
solid or half closed style.






**Hollow style (Open style)**: It is common
among monocots. A hollow canal running from
the stigma to the base of the style is present.
The canal is lined by a single layer of glandular
canal cells (Transmitting tissue).They secrete
mucilaginous substances. The pollen tube grows
on the surface of the cells lining the stylar canal.
The canal is filled with secretions which serve
as nutrition for growing pollen tubes and also
controlling incompatibility reaction between
the style and pollen tube. The secretions contain
carbohydrates, lipids and some enzymes
like esterases, acid phosphatases as well as
compatibility controlling proteins.


**Solid style (Closed type)**: It is common among
dicots. It is characterized by the presence of
central core of elongated, highly specialised
cells called transmitting tissue.This is equivalent
to the lining cells of hollow style and does the
same function. Its contents are also similar
to the content of those cells. The pollen tube
grows through the intercellular spaces of the
transmitting tissue.





**Semi-solid style (half closed type)**: This is
intermediate between solid and open type.





There is a difference of opinion on the
nature of transmitting tissue. Some authors
consider that it is found only in solid styles
while others consider the lining cells of hollow
style also has transmitting tissue.






**Entry of pollen tube into the ovule**: There
are three types of pollen tube entry into the
ovule(Figure 1.18).



**Porogamy**: when the pollen tube enters
through the micropyle.




![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/29.png )


**Chalazogamy**: when the pollen tube enters
through the chalaza.


**Mesogamy**: when the pollen tube enters
through the integument.




##### Entry of pollen tube into embryo sac:
Irrespective of the place of entry of pollen
tube into ovule, it enters the embryo sac at the
micropylar end. The pollen enters into embryo
sac directly into one of the synergids.



The growth of pollen tube towards the ovary,
ovule and embryo sac is due to the presence of
chemotropic substances. The pollen tube after
travelling the whole length of the style enters
into the ovary locule where it is guided towards
the micropyle of the ovule by a structure called
obturator (See Do you know). After reaching the
embryo sac, a pore is formed in pollen tube wall at
its apex or just behind the apex. The content of the
pollen tube (two male gametes, vegetative nucleus
and cytoplasm) are discharged into the synergids
into which pollen tube enters. The pollen tube
does not grow beyond it, in the embryo sac. The
tube nucleus disorganizes.



##### 1.5.1 Double fertilization and triple fusion


S.G. Nawaschin and L.Guignard in 1898 and
1899, observed in *Lilium* and *Fritillaria* that
both the male gametes released from a male
gametophyte are involved in the fertilization.
They fertilize two different components of
the embryo sac. Since both the male gametes
are involved in fertilization, the phenomenon
is called **double** **fertilization** and is unique
to angiosperms. One of the male gametes
fuses with the egg nucleus (syngamy) to form
Zygote. (Figure 1.19)




![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/30.png )


The second gamete migrates to the central cell
where it fuses with the **polar** **nuclei** or their



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/31.png )



fusion product, the secondary nucleus and
forms the **primary endosperm nucleus (PEN).**
Since this involves the fusion of three nuclei,
this phenomenon is called **triple fusion**. This
act results in endosperm formation which
forms the nutritive tissue for the embryo.


##### 1.6 Post Fertilization structure and events


After fertilization, several changes take place in
the floral parts up to the formation of the seed
(Figure 1.20).


The events after fertilization (endosperm,
embryo development, formation of seed, fruits)
are called fertilization changes.



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/32.png )



##### Endosperm


The primary endosperm nucleus (PEN)
divides immediately after fertilization but
before the zygote starts to divide, to form
the endosperm. The primary endosperm
nucleus is the result of triple fusion (two
polar nuclei and one sperm nucleus) and
thus has 3n number of chromosomes. It is
a nutritive tissue and regulatory structure
that nourishes the developing embryo.



Depending upon the mode of development
three types of endosperm are recognized in
angiosperms. They are nuclear endosperm,
cellular endosperm and helobial endosperm
(Figure 1.21).


**Nuclear endosperm**: Primary Endosperm
Nucleus undergoes several mitotic divisions
without cell wall formation thus a free nuclear
condition exists in the endosperm. Examples:
*Coccinia*, *Capsella* and *Arachis*



**Cellular endosperm**: Primary endosperm
nucleus divides into 2 nuclei and it is
immediately followed by wall formation.
Subsequent divisions also follow cell wall
formation. Examples: *Adoxa*, *Helianthus* and
*Scoparia*


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/33.png )



**Helobial endosperm**: Primary Endosperm
Nucleus moves towards base of embryo sac and
divides into two nuclei. Cell wall formation
takes place leading to the formation of a large
micropylar and small chalazal chamber. The
nucleus of the micropylar chamber undergoes
several free nuclear division whereas that
of chalazal chamber may or may not divide.
Examples : *Hydrilla* and *Vallisneria*.


The endosperms may either be completely
consumed by the developing embryo or it may
persist in the mature seeds. Those seeds without
endosperms are called non- endospermous or
ex- albuminous seeds. Examples: Pea, Groundnut and Beans. Those seeds with endosperms are
called endospermous or albuminous seeds. The
endosperms in these seeds supply nutrition to
the embryo during seed germination. Examples:
Paddy, Coconut and Castor.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/34.png )


**Ruminate endosperm**: The endosperm with
irregularity and unevenness in its surface forms
ruminate endosperm. Examples :*Areca catechu,*
*Passiflora* and *Myristica*


**Functions of endosperm:**


•	It is the nutritive tissue for the developing
embryo.


•  In majority of angiosperms, the zygote
divides only after the development of
endosperm.


•	Endosperm regulates the precise mode of embryo development.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/35.png )





**Development of Dicot embryo**


The Stages involved in the development
of Dicot embryo (*Capsella bursa-pastoris* –
Onagrad or crucifer type) is given in Figure
1.22. The embryo develops at micropylar
end of embryo sac. The zygote undergoes
transverse division to form upper or terminal
cell and lower or basal cell. Further divisions
in the zygote during the development lead to
the formation of embryo. Embryo undergoes
globular, heart shaped stages before reaching a
mature stage. The mature embryo has a **radicle**,
two **cotyledons** and a **plumule**.




![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/46.png )


##### Seed

The fertilized ovule is called seed and possesses
an embryo, endosperm and a protective coat.
Seeds may be endospermous (wheat, maize,
barley and sunflower) or non endospermo.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/36.png )


**Cicer seed (example for Dicot seed)**
The mature seeds are attached to the fruit
wall by a stalk called **funiculus**. The funiculus
disappears leaving a scar called **hilum**. Below
the hilum a small pore called **micropyle** is
present. It facilitates entry of oxygen and
water into the seeds during germination.
Each seed has a thick outer covering called
seed coat. The seed coat is developed from
integuments of the ovule. The outer coat is
called **testa** and is hard whereas the inner coat
is thin, membranous and is called **tegmen**.
In Pea plant the tegmen and testa are fused.
Two cotyledons laterally attached to the
embryonic axis and store the food materials
in pea whereas in other seeds like castor the




![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/37.png )



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/38.png )



**Figure 1.23(a)**
Dicot
- *Cicer arientinum*
endosperm contains reserve food and the
cotyledons are thin. The portion of embryonal
Fruit (Caryopsis) entire
axis projecting beyond the cotyledons is
called **radicle** or embryonic root. The other
end of the axis called embryonic shoot is
the **plumule**. Embryonal axis above the
Endosperm
level of cotyledon is called **epicotyl** whereas
Scutellum the level of
the cylindrical region between
Coleoptile
cotyledon is called **hypocotyl**(Figure
1.23 a).



**Oryza seed (example for Monocot seed)**

The seed of paddy is one seeded and is called
**Caryopsis**. Each seed remains enclosed by
a brownish husk which consists of glumes
arranged in two rows. The seed coat is a
brownish, membranous layer closely adhered to
the grain. Endosperm forms the bulk of the grain
and is the storage tissue. It is separated from
embryo by a definite layer called **epithelium**.
The embryo is small and consists of one shield-
shaped cotyledon known as **scutellum** present
towards lateral side of embryonal axis.



A short axis with plumule and radicle protected
by the **root** **cap** is present. The plumule is
surrounded by a protective sheath called
**coleoptile**. The radicle including root cap
is also covered by a protective sheath called
**coleorhiza**. The scutellum supplies the growing
embryo with food material absorbed from the
endosperm with the help of the epithelium
(Figure 1.23 b).



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/39.png )


#### 1.7 Apomixis


Reproduction involving fertilization in
flowering plants is called amphimixis and
wherever reproduction does not involve union
of male and female gametes is called apomixis.


The term Apomixis was introduced by
Winkler in the year 1908. It is defined as
the substitution of the usual sexual system
(Amphimixis) by a form of reproduction which
does not involve meiosis and syngamy.



Maheswari (1950) classified Apomixis into
two types - Recurrent and Non recurrent


**Recurrent apomixis**: It includes vegetative
reproduction and agamospermy


**Non recurrent apomixis**: Haploid embryo
sac developed after meiosis, develops into a
embryo without fertilization.


The outline classification of Recurrent
apomixis is given below.



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/40.png )




**Vegetative reproduction**: Plants propagate by
any part other than seeds


Bulbils – *Fritillaria imperialis*; Bulbs –
*Allium*; Runner – *Mentha arvensis*; Sucker -
*Chrysanthemum*

**Agamospermy**: It refers to processes by which
Embryos are formed by eliminating meiosis and
syngamy.


**Adventive embryony**


An Embryo arises directly from the diploid
sporophytic cells either from nucellus or
integument. It is also called **sporophytic**
**budding** because gametophytic phase is
completely absent. Adventive embryos are found
in *Citrus* and *Mangifera*


**Diplospory (Generative apospory)**: A diploid
embryo sac is formed from megaspore mother
cell without a regular meiotic division Examples.
*Eupatorium* and *Aerva*.


**Apospory**: Megaspore mother cell (MMC)
undergoes the normal meiosis and four
megaspores formed gradually disappear. A
nucellar cell becomes activated and develops into
a diploid embryo sac. This type of apospory is also
called somatic apospory. Examples *Hieracium*
and *Parthenium*.



#### 1.8 Polyembryony


Occurrence of more than one embryo in a
seed is called polyembryony (Figure 1.24).
The first case of polyembryony was reported
in certain oranges by Anton von Leeuwenhoek
in the year 1719. Polyembryony is divided into
four categories based on its origin.



![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/41.png )





a. **Cleavage polyembryony** (Example: Orchids)


b. **Formation of embryo by cells of the **Embryo**
**sac** other than egg** (Synergids – *Aristolochia*;
antipodals – *Ulmus* and endosperm –
*Balanophora*)


c. **Development of more than one Embryo sac**
**within the same ovule.** (Derivatives of same
MMC, derivatives of two or more MMC –
*Casuarina*)


d. **Activation of some sporophytic cells of **the**
**ovule**** (Nucellus/ integuments-*Citrus* and
*Syzygium*).


**Practical applications**


The seedlings formed from the nucellar tissue
in Citrus are found better clones for Orchards.
Embryos derived through polyembryony are
found virus free.


#### 1.9 Parthenocarpy


As mentioned earlier, the ovary becomes the
fruit and the ovule becomes the seed after
fertilization. However in a number of cases,
fruit like structures may develop from the
ovary without the act of fertilization. Such
fruits are called parthenocarpic fruits.
Invariably they will not have true seeds.
Many commercial fruits are made seedless.
Examples: Banana, Grapes and Papaya.


#### Significance


• The seedless fruits have great significance
in horticulture.

• The seedless fruits have great commercial
importance.


• Seedless fruits are useful for the preparation
of jams, jellies, sauces, fruit drinks etc.


• High proportion of edible part is available
in parthenocarpic fruits due to the absence
of seeds.


#### Summary


Reproduction is one of the attributes of
living things. Lower plants, microbes and
animals reproduce by different methods
(fragmentation, gemma, binary fission,
budding, regeneration). Organisms reproduce
through asexual and sexual methods. Asexual
methods in angiosperms occur through natural
or artificial methods. The natural methods
take place through vegetative propagules or
diaspores. Artificial method of reproduction
involves cutting, layering and grafting.
Micropropagation is a modern method used
to raise new plants.



Sexual
reproduction
includes
gametogenesis and fertilization. External
fertilization occurs in lower plants like algae
but in higher plants internal fertilization
takes place. A flower is a modified shoot
meant for reproduction. Stamen is the male
reproductive part and produces pollen grains.
The development of microspore is called
microsporogenesis. The microspore mother
cell undergoes meiotic division to produce
four haploid microspores. In majority of
Angiosperms the anther is dithecous and
are tetrasporangiate. It possesses epidermis,
endothecium, middle layers and tapetum.
The hygroscopic nature of endothecial cell
along with thin walled stomium helps in the
dehiscence of anther. Tapetum nourishes the
microspores and also contributes to the wall
materials of the pollen grain. Pollen grain is
derived from the microspore and possesses
thin inner intine and thick outer exine.
Sporopollenin is present in exine and is resistant
to physiological and biological decomposition.
Microspore is the first cell of male gametophyte.
The nucleus of the microspore divides to form
a vegetative nucleus and a generative nucleus.
The generative nucleus divides to form
two male nuclei. Gynoecium is the female
reproductive part of a flower and it represents
one or more pistils. The ovary bears ovules
which are attached to the placenta. There are
six major types of ovules. The development
of megaspore from megaspore mother cell
is called megasporogenesis. A monosporic
embryo sac (Polygonum type) possesses three
antipodals in chalazal end, Three cells in the
micropylar end constituting egg apparatus(1
gg and 2 Synergids) and two polar nucleus
fused to form secondary nucleus. Thus, a
7 celled 8 nucleated Embryo sac is present.
The transfer of pollen grains to the
stigma of a flower is called pollination. Self-
pollination and cross-pollination are two
types of pollination. Double fertilization
and triple fusion are characteristic features
of angiosperms. After fertilization the ovary
transforms into a fruit and the ovule becomes
a seed. Endosperm is triploid in angiosperms
and is of three types – Nuclear, cellular, helobial.
Reproduction which doesn’t involve meiosis
and syngamy is called apomixis. Occurrence
of more than one embryo in a seed is called
polyembryony. Formation of fruit without the
act of fertilization is called parthenocarpy.
