#### <u> 6.2.2 Edaphic factors </u>

Edaphic factors, the abiotic factors related
to soil, include the physical and chemical
composition of the soil formed in a particular
area. The study of soils is called Pedology.

**The soil**

Soil is the weathered superficial layer of the
Earth in which plants can grow. It is a complex
composite mass consisting of soil constituents,
soil water, soil air and soil organisms, etc.

**Soil formation**


Soil originates from rocks and develops gradually
at different rates, depending upon the ecological
and climatic conditions. Soil formation is
initiated by the weathering process. Biological
weathering takes place when organisms like
bacteria, fungi, lichens and plants help in the
breakdown of rocks through the production of
acids and certain chemical substances. 

**Soil types**

Based on soil formation (pedogenesis),
the soils are divided into

**1. Residual soils** –These are soils formed by
weathering and pedogenesis of the rock.

**2. Transported soils** – These are transported
by various agencies.

The important edaphic factors which affect
vegetation are as follows:

**1. Soil moisture:** Plants absorbs rain water
and moisture directly from the air

**2. Soil water:** Soil water is more important
than any other ecological factors affecting the
distribution of plants. Rain is the main source
of soil water. Capillary water held between
pore spaces of soil particles and angles
between them is the most important form of
water available to the plants.

**3. Soil reactions:** Soil may be acidic or
alkaline or neutral in their reaction. pH value
of the soil solution determines the availability
of plant nutrients. The best pH range of the soil
for cultivation of crop plants is **5.5 to 6.8.**


**4. Soil nutrients:**Soil fertility and productivity
is the ability of soil to provide all essential
plant nutrients such as minerals and organic
nutrients in the form of ions.


**5. Soil temperature:** Soil temperature of an
area plays an important role in determining
the geographical distribution of plants. Low
temperature reduces use of water and solute
absorption by roots.


**6. Soil atmosphere:** The spaces left between
soil particles are called pore spaces which
contains oxygen and carbon-di-oxide.

**7. Soil organisms:** Many organisms existing
in the soil like bacteria, fungi, algae,
protozoans, nematodes,
insects, earthworms, etc. are
called soil organisms. 

![Figure 6.7: Soil Profile](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic9.png )

**Soil Profile**

Soil is commonly stratified into horizons at
different depth. These layers differ in their
physical, chemical and biological properties.
This succession of super-imposed horizons is
called soil profile.

**Types of soil particles**

Based on the relative proportion of soil particles,
four types of soil are recognized.

![Table 6.3: Types of soil particles](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic10.png )

**Loamy soil is ideal soil for cultivation.** It
consists of 70% sand and 30% clay or silt or both.
It ensures good retention and proper drainage
of water. The porosity of soil provides adequate
aeration and allows the penetration of roots.

Based on the water retention, aeration and
mineral contents of soil, the distribution of
vegetation is divided into following types.

**1. Halophytes:** Plants living in saline soils

**2. Psammophytes:** Plants living in sandy soils

**3. Lithophytes:** Plants living on rocky surface

**4. Chasmophytes:** Plants living in rocky crevices

**5. Cryptophytes:**Plants living below the soil surface

**6. Cryophytes:**Plants living on surface of ice

**7. Oxylophytes:** Plants living in acidic soil

**8. Calciphytes:** Plants living in calcium rich
alkaline soil.

**Holard** – Total soil water content

**Chresard**–Water available to plants

**Echard** – Water not available to plants

**6.2.3 Topographic factors**


The surface features of earth are called
**topography.** Topographic influence on the
climate of any area is determined by the
interaction of solar radiation, temperature,
humidity, rainfall, latitude and altitude. It affects
the vegetation through climatic variations in
small areas (micro climate ) and even changes
the soil conditions. Topographic factors include
latitude, altitude, direction of mountain,
steepness of mountain etc.

**a. Latitudes and altitudes**

Latitudes represent distance from the equator.
Temperature values are maximum at the equator
and decrease gradually towards poles. Different
types of vegetation occur from equator to poles
which are illustrated below.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic11.png )

Height above the sea level forms the
**altitude.**At high altitudes, the velocity of wind
remains high, temperature and air pressure
decrease while humidity and intensity of light
increases. Due to these factors, vegetation at
different altitudes varies, showing distinct
zonation.

**b. Direction of Mountain**

North and south faces of mountain or hill possess
different types of flora and fauna because they
differ in their humidity, rainfall, light intensity,
light duration and temperature regions.

**Ecotone -** The transition zone between two
ecosystems. Example: The border between
forest and grassland.

**Edge effect –** Spices found in ecotone areas
are unique due to the effect of the two
habitats. This is called edge effect. Example:
Owl in the ecotone area between forest and
grassland.

The two faces of the mountain or hill receive
different amount of solar radiation, wind action
and rain. Of these two faces, the windward region
possesses good vegetation due to heavy rains and
the leeward region possesses poor vegetation due
to rain shadows (rain deficit).

Similarly in the soil of aquatic bodies like
ponds the center and edge possess different
depth of water due to soil slope and different
wave actions in the water body. Therefore,
different parts of the same area may possess
different species of organisms.

**c. Steepness of the mountain**

The steepness of the mountain or hill allows
the rain to run off. As a result the loss of water
causes water deficit and quick erosion of the top
soil resulting in poor vegetation. On the other
hand, the plains and valley are rich in vegetation
due to the slow drain of surface water and better
retention of water in the soil.

#### <u> 6.2.4 Biotic factors  </u> 

The interactions among living organisms
such as plants and animals are called **biotic**
**factors**, which may cause marked effects upon
vegetation. The effects may be direct and indirect
and modifies the environment. The plants
mostly which lives together in a community
and influence one another. Similarly, animals in
association with plants also affect the plant life
in one or several ways. The different interactions
among them can be classified into following two
types they are positive interaction and negative
interaction

**Positive interactions**

When one or both the participating species are
benefited, it is positive interaction. Examples;
Mutualism and Commensalism.

**a. Mutualism:** It is an interaction between
two species of organisms in which both are
benefitted from the obligate association. The
following are common examples of mutualism.

**Nitrogen fixation**

**Rhizobium**(Bacterium) forms nodules in the
roots of leguminous plants and lives symbiotically.
The Rhizobium obtains food from leguminous
plant and in turn fixes atmospheric nitrogen into
nitrate, making it available to host plants.

![Table 6.4: Different interactions of plant](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic13.png )

**Other examples:**


* Water fern
(Azolla) and
Nitrogen fixing
Cyanobacterium
(Anabaena ).

* Anab a e n a
present in
c o r a l l o i d
roots of Cycas.
(Gymnosperm)

* Cyanobacterium (Nostoc) found in the
thalloid body of Anthoceros.(Bryophytes)

* Wasps present in fruits of fig.

* Lichen is a mutual association of an alga
and a fungus.

* Roots of terrestrial plants and fungal
hyphae- Mycorrhiza

**b. Commensalism:**It is an interaction between
two organisms in which one is benefitted and
the other is neither benefitted nor harmed.
The species that derives benefit is called the
**commensal**, while the other species is called the
host. The common examples of commensalism
are listed below:

![Figure 6.10: A nodulated legume plant root with bacteria](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic14.png )



**Epiphytes**

The plants
which are found
growing on
other plants
without harming
them are called
epiphytes. They
are commonly
found in tropical
rain forest.

![Figure 6.11: An epiphytic plant-Vanda](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic15.png )

The epiphytic higher plant **(Orchid)** gets
its nutrients and water from the atmosphere
with the help of the hygroscopic roots which
contain special type of spongy tissue called
**Velamen.** It prepares its own food and does
not depend on the host. Using the host plant
only they support and does not harm it in any
way.

* Many orchids, ferns, lianas, hanging mosses,
Peperomia, money plant and Usnea (Lichen)
are some of the examples of epiphytes.

*  Spanish Moss –Tillandsia grows on the bark
of Oak and Pine trees.

{{< box title="Do You Know" type="objective" >}}

**Proto Cooperation**

An interaction between
organisms of different
species in which both
organisms benefit but neither is dependent
on the relationship. Example: Soil bacteria /
fungi and plants growing in the soil.

{{< /box >}}



**Negative interactions**

When one of the interacting species is benefitted
and the other is harmed, it is called negative
interaction . Examples: predation, parasitism,
competition and amensalism.

**a. Predation:** It is an interaction between two
species, one of which captures, kills and eats
up the other. The species which kills is called
a **predator** and the species which is killed is
called a **prey.** The predator is benefitted while
the prey is harmed.

**Examples:**

*  A number of
plants like Drosera
(Sun dew Plant),
Nepenthes (Pitcher
Plant), Dionaea
(Venus fly trap),
Utricularia (Bladder
wort) and Sarracenia
are predators which
consume insects and
other small animals
for their food as a source of nitrogen. They
are also called as **insectivorous plants.**

![Figure 6.12: Pitcher plant – with insect](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic16.png )

*  Many herbivores are predators. Cattles,
Camels, Goats etc., frequently browse on
the tender shoots of herbs, shrubs and
trees. Generally annuals suffer more than
the perennials. Grazing and browsing may
cause remarkable changes in vegetation.
Nearly 25 percent of all insects are known
as phytophagous(feeds on plant sap and
other parts of plant)

![Figure 6.13: Insectivorous plant Utricularia](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic17.png )

*  Many defense mechanisms are evolved to
avoid their predations by plants. Examples:
Calotropis produces highly poisonous cardiac
glycosides, Tobacco produces nicotine, coffee
plants produce caffeine, Cinchona plant
produces quinine. Thorns of Bougainvillea,
spines of Opuntia, and latex of cacti also
protect them from predators.

**b. Parasitism:** It is an interaction between two
different species in which the smaller partner
(parasite) obtains food from the larger partner
(host or plant). So the parasitic species is
benefited while the host species is harmed. Based
on the host-parasite relationship, parasitism is
classified into two types they are holoparasite
and hemiparasite.

**Holoparasites**

The organisms which are dependent upon the
host plants for their entire nutrition are called
**Holoparasites.** They are also called **total parasites**.

![Figure 6.14: a) Holoparasite – Cuscuta b) A Partial stem parasite – Viscum c) Root parasite on the brinjal root Orobanche spp. ](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic18.png )

Examples:

* Cuscuta is a total stem parasite of the
host plant Acacia, Duranta and many
other plants. Cuscuta even gets flower
inducing hormone from its host plant.

* Balanophora, Orobanche and Rafflesia
are the total root parasites found on
higher plants.

**Hemiparasites**

The organisms which derive only water
and minerals from their host plant while
synthesizing their own food by photosynthesis
are called **Hemiparasites** They are also called
**partial parasites**.

**Examples:**

* *Viscum* and *Loranthus* are partial stem
parasites.

* *Santalum* (Sandal Wood) is a partial root
parasite.

The parasitic plants produce the **haustorial roots** inside the host plant to absorb nutrients
from the vascular tissues of host plants.

**c. Competition:** It is an interaction between
two organisms or species in which both the
organisms or species are harmed. Competition
is the severest in population that has irregular
distribution. Competition is classified into
intraspecific and interspecific.

**1. Intraspecific competition:** It is an interaction
between individuals of the same species. This
competition is very severe because all the
members of species have similar requirements of
food, habitat, pollination etc. and they also have
similar adaptations to fulfill their needs.


**2. Interspecific competition:** It is an interaction
between individuals of different species. In
grassland, many species of grasses grow well as
there is little competition when enough nutrients
and water is available. During drought shortage
of water occurs . A life and death competition
starts among the different species of grass lands.
Survival in both these competitions is determined
by the quantity of nutrients, availability of water
and migration to new areas. Different species of
herbivores, larvae and grass hopper competing
for fodder or forage plants. Trees, shrubs and
herbs in a forest struggle for sunlight, water and
nutrients and also for pollination and dispersal of
fruits and seeds. The Utricularia (Bladderwort)
competes with tiny fishes for small crustaceans
and insectS.

**d. Amensalism:** It is an interspecific interaction
in which one species is inhibited while the other
species is neither benefitted nor harmed. The
inhibition is achieved by the secretion of certain
chemicals called **allelopathic** substances.

Amensalism is also called **antibiosis.**

* Penicillium notatum produces penicillin to
inhibit the growth of a variety of bacteria
especially Staphylococcus.

* Trichoderma inhibits the growth of fungus
Aspergillus.

*  Roots and hulls of Black Walnut Juglans
nigra secretes an alkaloid Juglone which
inhibits the growth of seedlings of Apple,
Tomato and Alfalfa around it.

**Interspecific interactions/ Co-evolutionary dynamics**

**i. Mimicry:** It is a phenomenon in which
living organism modifies its form, appearance,
structure or behavior and looks like another
living organism as a self defence and increases
the chance of its survival. Floral mimicry is
for usually inviting pollinators but animal
mimicry is often protective. Mimicry is a result
of evolutionary significance due to shape and
sudden heritable mutation and preservation by
natural selection.


![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic19.png )

Example:

* The plant, Ophrys an orchid, the flower looks
like a female insect to attract the male insect
to get pollinated by the male insect and it is
otherwise called ‘floral mimicry ‘.


* Carausium morosus – stick insect or
walking stick. It is a protective mimicry
• Phyllium frondosum – leaf insect, another
example of protective mimicry.

**ii. Myrmecophily:** Sometimes, ants take their
shelter on some trees such as Mango, Litchi,
Jamun, Acacia etc. These ants act as body
guards of the plants against any disturbing
agent and the plants in turn provide food
and shelter to these ants. This phenomenon
is known as Myrmecophily. Example: Acacia
and acacia ants.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic20.png )

**iii. Co-evolution:** The interaction between
organisms, when continues for generations,
involves reciprocal changes in genetic and
morphological characters of both organisms.
This type of evolution is called Co-evolution.
It is a kind of co- adaptation and mutual
change among interactive species.
Examples:

* Corolla length and proboscis length of
butterflies and moths ( Habenaria and Moth ).

* Bird’s beak shape and flower shape and size.

*  More examples: Horn bills and birds
of Scrub jungles ,Slit size of pollinia of
Apocynaceae members and leg size of
insects.
