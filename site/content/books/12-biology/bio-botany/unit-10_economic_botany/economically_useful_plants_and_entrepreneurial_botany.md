{{< /box >}}

The land and water of the earth sustain a
vast assemblage of plants upon which all
other living forms are directly or indirectly
dependent. Pre-historic humans lived on
berries, tubers, herbage, and the wild game
which they collected and hunted that occupied
whole of their time. Domestication of plants
and animals has led to the production of
surplus food which formed the basis for
civilizations. Early civilization in different
parts of the world has domesticated different
species of plants for various purposes. Based
on their utility, the economically useful plants
are classified into food plants, fodder plants,
fibre plants, timber plants, medicinal plants,
and plants used in paper industries, dyes and
cosmetics. Selected examples of economically
important plants for each category are
discussed in this chapter.

### <u> 10.1 Food plants</u>

Currently about 10,000 food plants are being
used of which only around 1,500 species were
brought under cultivation. However, food
base of majority of the population depends
only on three grass species namely rice, wheat
and maize.

### <u> 10.1.1 Cereals </u>

The word cereal is derived from Ceres, which
according to the Roman mythology denotes
“Goddess of agriculture”. All cereals are members
of grass family (Poaceae) that are grown for their
edible starchy seeds. The prominence of cereals
as food plants is due to the following attributes:

i. Greater adaptability and successful
colonisation on every type of habitat.


ii. The relative ease of cultivation


iii. Tillering property that produce more
branches which results in higher yield per
unit area.


iv. Compact and dry grains that they can be
easily handled, transported and stored
without undergoing spoilage.


v. High caloric value that provides energy.
The nutrients provided by cereals include
carbohydrates, proteins, fibres and a wide
range of vitamins and minerals. Cereals can
be classified into two different types based
on their size namely Major Cereals and
Minor Cereals.


### Major Cereals

#### <u> Rice / Paddy </u>

*Botanical name : Oryza sativa*

Paddy is a semi-aquatic crop and is grown in
standing water. It is an important food crop
of the world, occupying the second position
in terms of area under cultivation and
production, next to wheat. Rice is the chief
source of carbohydrate.

**Origin and Area of cultivation**

South East Asia is considered as the center
of origin of rice. Earliest evidences of rice
cultivation have been found in China, India
and Thailand. It is mainly cultivated in Delta
and irrigated regions of Tamil Nadu.

**Uses**

**Rice** is the easily digestible calorie rich
cereal food which is used as a staple food
in Southern and North East India. Various
rice products such as **Flaked rice** (Aval),
**Puffed rice / parched rice** (Pori) are used as
breakfast cereal or as snack food in different
parts of India.

**Rice bran oil** obtained from the rice bran is
used in culinary and industrial purposes.

**Husks**are used as fuel, and in the manufacture
of packing material and fertilizer.

**Origin and Area of cultivation**

Earliest evidence for wheat cultivation
comes from Fertile Crescent region. The
common cultivated wheat, Triticum aestivum
is cultivated for about 7,500 years. Wheat is
mostly cultivated in the North Indian states
such as Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana,
Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar.

**Uses**

Wheat is the staple food in Northern India.
Wheat flour is suitable to make bread and other
bakery products. Processed wheat flour, that
has little fibre, is called Maida which is used
extensively in making parota, naan and bakery
products. Malted wheat is a major raw material
for producing alcoholic beverages and nutritive
drinks.

{{< box title=" DO YOU KNOW ??" type="objective" >}}


**PSEUDO-CEREAL**

The term pseudo-cereal is
used to describe foods that
are prepared and eaten
as a whole grain,
but are botanical
outliers
from
grasses. Example:
quinoa.
It
is
actually a seed from
Pseudo cereal -
the Chenopodium
Chenopodium quinoa
quinoa
plant
belongs to the family Amaranthaceae. It is
a gluten-free, whole-grain carbohydrate, as
well as a whole protein (meaning it contains
all nine essential amino acids) and have been
eaten for 6,000 years in Andes hill region.

**Uses**

Most of the corn produced is used as
fodder than food. Corn syrup is used in
the manufacture of infant foods. Corn is a
raw material in the industrial production of
alcohol and alcoholic beverages

**10.1.2 Millets (Siru Thaniyangal)**

The term millet is applied to a variety of very
small seeds originally cultivated by ancient
people in Africa and Asia. They are gluten free
and have less glycemic index.

Kodo millet is originated from West Africa,
which is rich in fibre, protein and minerals.

**Uses**

Kodo millet is ground into flour and used
to make pudding. Good diuretic and cures
constipation. Helps to reduce obesity, blood
sugar and blood pressure.

## <u> 10.1.4 Pulses </u>

The word Pulse is derived from the Latin
words ‘puls’ or ‘pultis’ meaning “thick soup”.
Pulses are the edible seeds that are harvested
from the fruits of Fabaceae. They provide vital
source of plant-based protein, vitamins and
minerals for people around the globe.

**Black gram**

*Botanical name : Vigna mungo*

**Origin and Area of cultivation**

Black gram is native to India. Earliest
archeobotanical evidences record the presence
of black gram about 3,500
years ago. It is cultivated as
a rain fed crop in drier parts
of India. India contributes to
80% of the global production
of black gram. Important states
growing black gram in India are
Uttar Pradesh, Chattisgarh and
Karnataka.

![Figure 10.4: Pulses](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic4.png)

#### <u> 10.1.5 Vegetables </u>

While walking through a market filled with fresh
vegetables like stacks of lady’s finger, mountains
of potatoes, pyramids of brinjal, tomatoes,
cucurbits, we learn to choose the vegetables that
is fresh, tender, ripe and those suit the family
taste through experience and cultural practices.
Why do we need to eat vegetables and what do
they provide us?

Vegetables are the important part of
healthy eating and provide many nutrients,
including potassium, fiber, folic acid and
vitamins A, E and C. The nutrients in vegetables
are vital for maintenance of our health.

**Lady’s finger / Okra**

*Botanical name : Abelmoschus esculentus*
Family: Malvaceae

**Origin and Area of cultivation**

Lady’s finger is a native of the Tropical Africa.
Assam, Maharashtra and Gujarat are the
important states where Lady’s finger is grown in
abundance. Coimbatore, Dharmapuri and Vellore
are the major cultivating regions of Tamil Nadu.

**Uses**

The fresh and green tender fruits are used
as a vegetable. Often they are sliced and
dehydrated to conserve them for later use. It
has most important nutrients.

**10.1.6 Fruits**

Edible fruits are fleshy structures with a pleasant
aroma and flavours. Fruits are sources of many
nutrients including potassium, dietary fiber,
folic acid and vitamins.Depending on the
climatic region in which fruit crops grow, they
can be classified into temperate(apple, pear,
plum) and tropical fruits (mango, jack, banana).
In this chapter we will study an example of
tropical fruit.

**Mango** (National fruit of India)

*Botanical name : Mangifera indica*
*Family: Anacardiaceae*

![Figure 10.5: Mango](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic5.png)

Origin and Area of
cultivation
The mango is the native
to
Southern
Asia,
especially Burma and
Eastern India. It is the
National fruit of India. Figure 10.5: Mango
Major mango producing
States are Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat and
Karnataka. Salem, Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri are
the major mango producing districts of Tamil
Nadu. Some of the major cultivars of mango in
India are Alphonsa, Banganapalli, neelam and
malgova.

**Uses**

Mango is the major table fruit of India, which
is rich in beta carotenes. It is utilized in many
ways, as dessert, canned, dried and preserves
in Indian cuisine. Sour, unripe mangoes are
used in chutneys, pickles, side dishes, or may
be eaten raw with salt and chili. Mango pulp is
made into jelly. Aerated and non-aerated fruit
juice is a popular soft drink.

##### <u> 10.1.7 Nuts </u>
Nuts are simple dry fruits composed of a hard
shell and an edible kernel. They are packed
with a good source of healthy fats, fibre,
protein, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.

**Cashew nut**
*Botanical name : Anacardium occidentale*
*Family: Anacardiaceae*

**Origin and Area of cultivation**

Cashew has originated in Brazil and made its way
to India in the 16th century through Portuguese
sailors. Cashew is grown in Kerala, Karnataka,
Goa, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Orissa.

![Figure 10.6: Nuts](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic6.png)

**Uses**

Cashews
are
commonly
used
for
garnishing
sweets or curries, or Cashew
ground into a paste
that forms a base of
sauces for curries or some sweets. Roasted and
raw kernels are used as snacks.


**10.1.8 Sugars**

We experienced sweetness while eating the
stems of sugarcane, roots of sugar beet, fruits
of apple and while drinking palmyra sap. This
is due to the different proportions of sugars
found in it. Sugar is the generic name for
sweet tasting soluble carbohydrate, which are
used in foods and beverages. Sugars found in
sugarcane and palmyra make them ideal for
efficient extraction to make commercial sugar.

**Sugarcane**

*Botanical name : Saccharum officinarum*
*Family : Poaceae*

**Origin and Area of cultivation**

The cultivated Saccharum officinarum
has evolved by repeated back crossing of
S.officinarum of New Guinea with wild
S.spontaneum of India to improve the quality.
All districts except Kanyakumari and Nilgiris
of Tamil Nadu cultivate Sugarcane.

**Uses**

Sugar cane is the raw material for extracting
white sugar. Sugarcane supports large number
of industries like sugar mills producing refined
sugars, distilleries producing liquor grade
ethanol and millions of jaggery manufacturing
units. Fresh sugarcane juice is a refreshing
drink. Molasses is the raw material for the
production of ethyl alcohol.

**Palmyra (State tree of Tamil Nadu)**

*Botanical name : Borassus flabellifer*
*Family: Arecaceae*

**Origin and Area of cultivation**

Palmyra is native to tropical regions of Africa,
Asia and New Guinea. Palmyra grows all over
Tamil Nadu, especially in coastal districts.

**Uses**

Exudate from inflorescence axis is collected for
preparing palm sugar. Inflorescence is tapped for its
sap which is used as health drink. Sap is processed
to get palm jaggery or fermented to give **toddy.**

Endosperm is used as a refreshing summer
food. Germinated seeds have an elongated embryo
surrounded by fleshy scale leaf which is edible.

#### <u>10.1.9 Oil Seeds </u>

Why fried foods are tastier than boiled foods?
There are two kinds of oils namely, essential
oils and vegetable oils or fatty oils. The
essential oils or volatile oils which possess
aroma evaporate or volatilize in contact
with air. Any organ of a plant may be the
source of essential oil. For example, flowers
of Jasmine, fruits of orange and roots of
ginger. The vegetable oils or non-volatile
oils or fixed oils that do not evaporate.
Whole seeds or endosperm form the sources
of vegetable oils.

Let us know about few oil seeds

**Groundnut / Peanut**
*Botanical name : Arachis hypogaea*
*Family : Fabaceae*

Origin and Area of
Cultivation: Groundnut is
native of Brazil. Portuguese
introduced groundnut into
Africa. The Spanish took
it to the South East Asia
and India via Philippines. In India Gujarat,
Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan are top
producers.

**Uses**

Nuts contain about 45% oil. The kernels
are also rich sources of phosphorous and
vitamins, particularly thiamine, riboflavin
and niacin. It is premium cooking oil because
it does not smoke. Lower grade oil is used in
manufacture of soaps and lubricants.

**Sesame / Gingelly**
*Botanical name : Sesamum indicum*
*Family : Pedaliaceae*

**Origin and Area of cultivation:**Sesamum
indicum has originated from Africa.. Sesame
is cultivated as a dry land crop. West Bengal
and Madhya Pradesh are the top producers
in India during 2017-18. It is considered as a
healthy oil in Southern Indian culture.

**Uses**

Sesame oil is used for mostly culinary purposes
in India. Lower grades are used in manufacture
of soaps, in paint industries, as a lubricant and as
an illuminant. In India, the oil is the basis of most
of the scented oils used in perfumes. Sesame seed
snacks are popular throughout India.

#### <u> 10.1.10 Beverages </u>

**How about a cup of coffee or tea? We always entertain our guests with this offer.**

All non-alcoholic beverages contain alkaloids
that stimulate central nervous system and also
possess mild diuretic properties.
**Coffee**

*Botanical name : Coffea arabica*
*Family : Rubiaceae*

Why does a student
or a driver prefer
tea or coffee during
night work?

**Origin and Area Coffee of cultivation:**

![Figure 10.9: Beverages](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic9.png)

Coffea arabica is
the prime source
of commercial coffee which is native to the
tropical Ethiopia An Indian Muslim saint,
Baba Budan introduced coffee from Yemen
to Mysore.Karnataka is the largest coffee
producing state in India followed by Tamil
Nadu and Kerala. Tamil Nadu is the largest
consumer of coffee in India.

**Uses**

Drinking coffee in moderation provides the
following health benefits:


Caffeine enhances release of acetylcholine
in brain, which in turn enhances efficiency. It can
lower the incidence of fatty liver diseases, cirrhosis
and cancer. It may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.

**10.2 Spices and Condiments**

**Aroma attracts everyone**

**History:**

Spices were used extensively throughout the
world for several thousands of years. Records
of use of garlic and onion dates back 2500 years.
Majority of the spices are native to
Mediterranean region, India and South East
Asian countries. Spices, especially pepper
triggered the search for sea route to India
and paved way for the exploratory voyages by
Spanish and Portuguese.

![Figure 10.10: Spices](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic10.png)

Spices are accessory foods mainly used
for flavouring during food preparation to
improve their palatability. Spices are aromatic
plant products and are characterized by sweet
or bitter taste. Spices are added in minimal
quantities during the cooking process. For
example black pepper.

Condiments, on the other hand, are
flavouring substances having a sharp taste and
are usually added to food after cooking. For
example, curry leaves.

The following spices and condiment are
discussed in detail.

Turmeric is one of the most important and
ancient Indian spices and used traditionally over
thousands of years for culinary, cosmetic, dyeing
and for medicinal purposes. It is an important
constituent of curry powders. Turmeric is used
as a colouring agent in pharmacy, confectionery
and food industry. Rice coloured with turmeric
(yellow) is considered sacred and auspicious
which is used in ceremonies. It is also used for
dyeing leather, fibre, paper and toys.

Curcumin extracted from turmeric is
responsible for the yellow colour. Curcumin is
a very good anti-oxidant which may help fight
various kinds of cancer. It has anti-inflammatory,
anti-diabetic, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-
viral activities. It stops platelets from clotting in
arteries, which leads to heart attack.

**Chillies / Red Pepper**

fruits of C.frutescens. C.annum includes large,
sweet bell peppers. Long fruit cultivars of this
species are commercially known as ‘Cayenne
pepper’ which are crushed, powdered and used
as condiment. Chillies are used in manufacture
of sauces, curry powders and preparation of
pickles. Capsaicin is an active component of
chillies. It has pain relieving properties and
used in pain relieving balms. Chillies are a
good source of Vitamin C, A and E.

{{< box title=" DO YOU KNOW ??" type="objective" >}}

Capsaicin is responsible
for the pungency or spicy
taste of chillies. Pungency

 #### 10.6 Pulp Wood

The term paper is
derived from the
word
‘papyrus’
a plant (Cyperus
papyrus) that was Figure 10.15 : Wood pulp
used by Egyptians
to make paper-like materials. Paper production
is a Chinese invention. The Chinese discovered
the paper that was prepared from the inner bark
of paper mulberry in 105 A.D. For a long time,
the art of paper making remained a monopoly
of the Chinese until Arabs learned the technique
and improved it around 750 A.D. Invention of
printing increased the demand for paper.
Manufacture of Wood pulp: Wood
is converted into pulp by mechanical,
and chemical processes. Wood of Melia
azadirachta, Neolamarkia chinensis, Casuarina

#### 10.8 Cosmetics

Traditionally in Southern India, people have
been using turmeric, green gram powder,
henna, sigaikai and usilai for their skin and
hair care. These were mostly home prepared
products that are used for grooming. Today,

and have become chemical based industrial
products. Providing personal care services
has become a major industry. In recent years,
people have realized the hazards of chemical-
based cosmetics and are turning back to
natural products. In this chapter one of the
major plants namely Aloe which is used in the
cosmetic industries is discussed.
