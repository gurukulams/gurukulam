{{< /box >}}

The land and water of the earth sustain a
vast assemblage of plants upon which all
other living forms are directly or indirectly
dependent. Pre-historic humans lived on
berries, tubers, herbage, and the wild game
which they collected and hunted that occupied
whole of their time. Domestication of plants
and animals has led to the production of
surplus food which formed the basis for
civilizations. Early civilization in different
parts of the world has domesticated different
species of plants for various purposes. Based
on their utility, the economically useful plants
are classified into food plants, fodder plants,
fibre plants, timber plants, medicinal plants,
and plants used in paper industries, dyes and
cosmetics. Selected examples of economically
important plants for each category are
discussed in this chapter.

### <u> 10.1 Food plants</u>

Currently about 10,000 food plants are being
used of which only around 1,500 species were
brought under cultivation. However, food
base of majority of the population depends
only on three grass species namely rice, wheat
and maize.

### <u> 10.1.1 Cereals </u>

The word cereal is derived from Ceres, which
according to the Roman mythology denotes
“Goddess of agriculture”. All cereals are members
of grass family (Poaceae) that are grown for their
edible starchy seeds. The prominence of cereals
as food plants is due to the following attributes:

i. Greater adaptability and successful
colonisation on every type of habitat.


ii. The relative ease of cultivation


iii. Tillering property that produce more
branches which results in higher yield per
unit area.


iv. Compact and dry grains that they can be
easily handled, transported and stored
without undergoing spoilage.


v. High caloric value that provides energy.
The nutrients provided by cereals include
carbohydrates, proteins, fibres and a wide
range of vitamins and minerals. Cereals can
be classified into two different types based
on their size namely Major Cereals and
Minor Cereals.


### Major Cereals

#### <u> Rice / Paddy </u>

*Botanical name : Oryza sativa*

Paddy is a semi-aquatic crop and is grown in
standing water. It is an important food crop
of the world, occupying the second position
in terms of area under cultivation and
production, next to wheat. Rice is the chief
source of carbohydrate.

**Origin and Area of cultivation**

South East Asia is considered as the center
of origin of rice. Earliest evidences of rice
cultivation have been found in China, India
and Thailand. It is mainly cultivated in Delta
and irrigated regions of Tamil Nadu.

**Uses**

**Rice** is the easily digestible calorie rich
cereal food which is used as a staple food
in Southern and North East India. Various
rice products such as **Flaked rice** (Aval),
**Puffed rice / parched rice** (Pori) are used as
breakfast cereal or as snack food in different
parts of India.

**Rice bran oil** obtained from the rice bran is
used in culinary and industrial purposes.

**Husks**are used as fuel, and in the manufacture
of packing material and fertilizer.

**Origin and Area of cultivation**

Earliest evidence for wheat cultivation
comes from Fertile Crescent region. The
common cultivated wheat, Triticum aestivum
is cultivated for about 7,500 years. Wheat is
mostly cultivated in the North Indian states
such as Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana,
Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar.

**Uses**

Wheat is the staple food in Northern India.
Wheat flour is suitable to make bread and other
bakery products. Processed wheat flour, that
has little fibre, is called Maida which is used
extensively in making parota, naan and bakery
products. Malted wheat is a major raw material
for producing alcoholic beverages and nutritive
drinks.

{{< box title=" DO YOU KNOW ??" type="objective" >}}


**PSEUDO-CEREAL**

The term pseudo-cereal is
used to describe foods that
are prepared and eaten
as a whole grain,
but are botanical
outliers
from
grasses. Example:
quinoa.
It
is
actually a seed from
Pseudo cereal -
the Chenopodium
Chenopodium quinoa
quinoa
plant
belongs to the family Amaranthaceae. It is
a gluten-free, whole-grain carbohydrate, as
well as a whole protein (meaning it contains
all nine essential amino acids) and have been
eaten for 6,000 years in Andes hill region.

**Uses**

Most of the corn produced is used as
fodder than food. Corn syrup is used in
the manufacture of infant foods. Corn is a
raw material in the industrial production of
alcohol and alcoholic beverages

**10.1.2 Millets (Siru Thaniyangal)**

The term millet is applied to a variety of very
small seeds originally cultivated by ancient
people in Africa and Asia. They are gluten free
and have less glycemic index.

Kodo millet is originated from West Africa,
which is rich in fibre, protein and minerals.

**Uses**

Kodo millet is ground into flour and used
to make pudding. Good diuretic and cures
constipation. Helps to reduce obesity, blood
sugar and blood pressure.

## <u> 10.1.4 Pulses </u>

The word Pulse is derived from the Latin
words ‘puls’ or ‘pultis’ meaning “thick soup”.
Pulses are the edible seeds that are harvested
from the fruits of Fabaceae. They provide vital
source of plant-based protein, vitamins and
minerals for people around the globe.

**Black gram**

*Botanical name : Vigna mungo*

**Origin and Area of cultivation**

Black gram is native to India. Earliest
archeobotanical evidences record the presence
of black gram about 3,500
years ago. It is cultivated as
a rain fed crop in drier parts
of India. India contributes to
80% of the global production
of black gram. Important states
growing black gram in India are
Uttar Pradesh, Chattisgarh and
Karnataka.

![Figure 10.4: Pulses](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic4.png)

#### <u> 10.1.5 Vegetables </u>

While walking through a market filled with fresh
vegetables like stacks of lady’s finger, mountains
of potatoes, pyramids of brinjal, tomatoes,
cucurbits, we learn to choose the vegetables that
is fresh, tender, ripe and those suit the family
taste through experience and cultural practices.
Why do we need to eat vegetables and what do
they provide us?

Vegetables are the important part of
healthy eating and provide many nutrients,
including potassium, fiber, folic acid and
vitamins A, E and C. The nutrients in vegetables
are vital for maintenance of our health.

**Lady’s finger / Okra**

*Botanical name : Abelmoschus esculentus*
Family: Malvaceae

**Origin and Area of cultivation**

Lady’s finger is a native of the Tropical Africa.
Assam, Maharashtra and Gujarat are the
important states where Lady’s finger is grown in
abundance. Coimbatore, Dharmapuri and Vellore
are the major cultivating regions of Tamil Nadu.

**Uses**

The fresh and green tender fruits are used
as a vegetable. Often they are sliced and
dehydrated to conserve them for later use. It
has most important nutrients.

**10.1.6 Fruits**

Edible fruits are fleshy structures with a pleasant
aroma and flavours. Fruits are sources of many
nutrients including potassium, dietary fiber,
folic acid and vitamins.Depending on the
climatic region in which fruit crops grow, they
can be classified into temperate(apple, pear,
plum) and tropical fruits (mango, jack, banana).
In this chapter we will study an example of
tropical fruit.

**Mango** (National fruit of India)

*Botanical name : Mangifera indica*
*Family: Anacardiaceae*

![Figure 10.5: Mango](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic5.png)

Origin and Area of
cultivation
The mango is the native
to
Southern
Asia,
especially Burma and
Eastern India. It is the
National fruit of India. Figure 10.5: Mango
Major mango producing
States are Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat and
Karnataka. Salem, Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri are
the major mango producing districts of Tamil
Nadu. Some of the major cultivars of mango in
India are Alphonsa, Banganapalli, neelam and
malgova.

**Uses**

Mango is the major table fruit of India, which
is rich in beta carotenes. It is utilized in many
ways, as dessert, canned, dried and preserves
in Indian cuisine. Sour, unripe mangoes are
used in chutneys, pickles, side dishes, or may
be eaten raw with salt and chili. Mango pulp is
made into jelly. Aerated and non-aerated fruit
juice is a popular soft drink.

##### <u> 10.1.7 Nuts </u>
Nuts are simple dry fruits composed of a hard
shell and an edible kernel. They are packed
with a good source of healthy fats, fibre,
protein, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.

**Cashew nut**
*Botanical name : Anacardium occidentale*
*Family: Anacardiaceae*

**Origin and Area of cultivation**

Cashew has originated in Brazil and made its way
to India in the 16th century through Portuguese
sailors. Cashew is grown in Kerala, Karnataka,
Goa, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Orissa.

![Figure 10.6: Nuts](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic6.png)

**Uses**

Cashews
are
commonly
used
for
garnishing
sweets or curries, or Cashew
ground into a paste
that forms a base of
sauces for curries or some sweets. Roasted and
raw kernels are used as snacks.


**10.1.8 Sugars**

We experienced sweetness while eating the
stems of sugarcane, roots of sugar beet, fruits
of apple and while drinking palmyra sap. This
is due to the different proportions of sugars
found in it. Sugar is the generic name for
sweet tasting soluble carbohydrate, which are
used in foods and beverages. Sugars found in
sugarcane and palmyra make them ideal for
efficient extraction to make commercial sugar.

**Sugarcane**

*Botanical name : Saccharum officinarum*
*Family : Poaceae*

**Origin and Area of cultivation**

The cultivated Saccharum officinarum
has evolved by repeated back crossing of
S.officinarum of New Guinea with wild
S.spontaneum of India to improve the quality.
All districts except Kanyakumari and Nilgiris
of Tamil Nadu cultivate Sugarcane.

**Uses**

Sugar cane is the raw material for extracting
white sugar. Sugarcane supports large number
of industries like sugar mills producing refined
sugars, distilleries producing liquor grade
ethanol and millions of jaggery manufacturing
units. Fresh sugarcane juice is a refreshing
drink. Molasses is the raw material for the
production of ethyl alcohol.

**Palmyra (State tree of Tamil Nadu)**

*Botanical name : Borassus flabellifer*
*Family: Arecaceae*

**Origin and Area of cultivation**

Palmyra is native to tropical regions of Africa,
Asia and New Guinea. Palmyra grows all over
Tamil Nadu, especially in coastal districts.

**Uses**

Exudate from inflorescence axis is collected for
preparing palm sugar. Inflorescence is tapped for its
sap which is used as health drink. Sap is processed
to get palm jaggery or fermented to give **toddy.**

Endosperm is used as a refreshing summer
food. Germinated seeds have an elongated embryo
surrounded by fleshy scale leaf which is edible.

#### <u>10.1.9 Oil Seeds </u>

Why fried foods are tastier than boiled foods?
There are two kinds of oils namely, essential
oils and vegetable oils or fatty oils. The
essential oils or volatile oils which possess
aroma evaporate or volatilize in contact
with air. Any organ of a plant may be the
source of essential oil. For example, flowers
of Jasmine, fruits of orange and roots of
ginger. The vegetable oils or non-volatile
oils or fixed oils that do not evaporate.
Whole seeds or endosperm form the sources
of vegetable oils.

Let us know about few oil seeds

**Groundnut / Peanut**
*Botanical name : Arachis hypogaea*
*Family : Fabaceae*

Origin and Area of
Cultivation: Groundnut is
native of Brazil. Portuguese
introduced groundnut into
Africa. The Spanish took
it to the South East Asia
and India via Philippines. In India Gujarat,
Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan are top
producers.

**Uses**

Nuts contain about 45% oil. The kernels
are also rich sources of phosphorous and
vitamins, particularly thiamine, riboflavin
and niacin. It is premium cooking oil because
it does not smoke. Lower grade oil is used in
manufacture of soaps and lubricants.

**Sesame / Gingelly**
*Botanical name : Sesamum indicum*
*Family : Pedaliaceae*

**Origin and Area of cultivation:**Sesamum
indicum has originated from Africa.. Sesame
is cultivated as a dry land crop. West Bengal
and Madhya Pradesh are the top producers
in India during 2017-18. It is considered as a
healthy oil in Southern Indian culture.

**Uses**

Sesame oil is used for mostly culinary purposes
in India. Lower grades are used in manufacture
of soaps, in paint industries, as a lubricant and as
an illuminant. In India, the oil is the basis of most
of the scented oils used in perfumes. Sesame seed
snacks are popular throughout India.

#### <u> 10.1.10 Beverages </u>

**How about a cup of coffee or tea? We always entertain our guests with this offer.**

All non-alcoholic beverages contain alkaloids
that stimulate central nervous system and also
possess mild diuretic properties.
**Coffee**

*Botanical name : Coffea arabica*
*Family : Rubiaceae*

Why does a student
or a driver prefer
tea or coffee during
night work?

**Origin and Area Coffee of cultivation:**

![Figure 10.9: Beverages](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic9.png)

Coffea arabica is
the prime source
of commercial coffee which is native to the
tropical Ethiopia An Indian Muslim saint,
Baba Budan introduced coffee from Yemen
to Mysore.Karnataka is the largest coffee
producing state in India followed by Tamil
Nadu and Kerala. Tamil Nadu is the largest
consumer of coffee in India.

**Uses**

Drinking coffee in moderation provides the
following health benefits:


Caffeine enhances release of acetylcholine
in brain, which in turn enhances efficiency. It can
lower the incidence of fatty liver diseases, cirrhosis
and cancer. It may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.

**10.2 Spices and Condiments**

**Aroma attracts everyone**

**History:**

Spices were used extensively throughout the
world for several thousands of years. Records
of use of garlic and onion dates back 2500 years.
Majority of the spices are native to
Mediterranean region, India and South East
Asian countries. Spices, especially pepper
triggered the search for sea route to India
and paved way for the exploratory voyages by
Spanish and Portuguese.

![Figure 10.10: Spices](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic10.png)

Spices are accessory foods mainly used
for flavouring during food preparation to
improve their palatability. Spices are aromatic
plant products and are characterized by sweet
or bitter taste. Spices are added in minimal
quantities during the cooking process. For
example black pepper.

Condiments, on the other hand, are
flavouring substances having a sharp taste and
are usually added to food after cooking. For
example, curry leaves.

The following spices and condiment are
discussed in detail.

Turmeric is one of the most important and
ancient Indian spices and used traditionally over
thousands of years for culinary, cosmetic, dyeing
and for medicinal purposes. It is an important
constituent of curry powders. Turmeric is used
as a colouring agent in pharmacy, confectionery
and food industry. Rice coloured with turmeric
(yellow) is considered sacred and auspicious
which is used in ceremonies. It is also used for
dyeing leather, fibre, paper and toys.

Curcumin extracted from turmeric is
responsible for the yellow colour. Curcumin is
a very good anti-oxidant which may help fight
various kinds of cancer. It has anti-inflammatory,
anti-diabetic, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-
viral activities. It stops platelets from clotting in
arteries, which leads to heart attack.

**Chillies / Red Pepper**

fruits of C.frutescens. C.annum includes large,
sweet bell peppers. Long fruit cultivars of this
species are commercially known as ‘Cayenne
pepper’ which are crushed, powdered and used
as condiment. Chillies are used in manufacture
of sauces, curry powders and preparation of
pickles. Capsaicin is an active component of
chillies. It has pain relieving properties and
used in pain relieving balms. Chillies are a
good source of Vitamin C, A and E.

{{< box title=" DO YOU KNOW ??" type="objective" >}}

Capsaicin is responsible
for the pungency or spicy
taste of chillies. Pungency

 #### 10.6 Pulp Wood

The term paper is
derived from the
word
‘papyrus’
a plant (Cyperus
papyrus) that was Figure 10.15 : Wood pulp
used by Egyptians
to make paper-like materials. Paper production
is a Chinese invention. The Chinese discovered
the paper that was prepared from the inner bark
of paper mulberry in 105 A.D. For a long time,
the art of paper making remained a monopoly
of the Chinese until Arabs learned the technique
and improved it around 750 A.D. Invention of
printing increased the demand for paper.
Manufacture of Wood pulp: Wood
is converted into pulp by mechanical,
and chemical processes. Wood of Melia
azadirachta, Neolamarkia chinensis, Casuarina

An orange dye ‘Henna’ is obtained from the
leaves and young shoots of Lawsonia inermis. The
principal colouring matter of leaves ‘lacosone”
is harmless and causes no irritation to the skin.
This dye has long been used to dye skin, hair and
finger nails. It is used for colouring leather, for
the tails of horses and in hair-dyes.

#### 10.8 Cosmetics

Traditionally in Southern India, people have
been using turmeric, green gram powder,
henna, sigaikai and usilai for their skin and
hair care. These were mostly home prepared
products that are used for grooming. Today,
cosmetics have a high commercial value
and have become chemical based industrial
products. Providing personal care services
has become a major industry. In recent years,
people have realized the hazards of chemical-
based cosmetics and are turning back to
natural products. In this chapter one of the
major plants namely Aloe which is used in the
cosmetic industries is discussed.

#### Aloe
*Botanical name : Aloe vera*
*Family: Asphodelaceae (formerly Liliaceae)*

Origin and Area of cultivation: It is a native
of Sudan. It is cultivated on a large scale in
Rajasthan, Gujarat,
Maharashtra, Andhra
Pradesh and Tamil
Nadu.

**Uses**


‘Aloin’ (a mixture
of glucosides) and its gel are used as skin
tonic. It has a cooling effect and moisturizing
characteristics and hence used in preparation
of creams, lotions, shampoos, shaving creams,
after shave lotions and allied products. It
is used in gerontological applications for
rejuvenation of aging skin. Products prepared
from aloe leaves have multiple properties such
as emollient, antibacterial, antioxidant,
antifungal and antiseptic. Aloe vera gel is used in skin care cosmetics.

### 10.8.1 Perfumes

The word perfume is derived from the Latin
word Per (through) and fumus (to smoke),
meaning through smoke. It refers to the
age-old tradition of burning scented woods
at religious ceremonies.In early days, when
people were less conscious of personal
hygiene, essential oils not only masked
offensive odours, but also may have acted as
antiseptics. Perfumes are added to baths and
used for anointing the body.

Perfumes are manufacturefrom essential
oil which are volatile and aromatic. Essential
oils are found at different parts of the plant
such as leaves, (curry leaf, mint), flowers (rose,
jasmine), fruits (citrus, straw berry) and wood
(sandal, eucalyptus).

**Jasmine**
Botanical name : *Jasminum grandiflorum*

Family: Oleaceae
Jasmine, as a
floral perfume,
ranks next to
the rose oil.
Major
species
cultivated on the
commercial scale

![](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic18.png)

is
Jasminum
grandiflorum, a native of the north-western
Himalayas. In Tamil Nadu, the major jasmine
cultivation centres are Madurai and Thovalai
of Kanyakumari District. The essential oil is
present in the epidermal cells of the inner and
outer surfaces of both the sepals and petals.
One ton of Jasmine blossom yields about 2.5
to 3 kg of essential oil, comprising 0.25 to 3%
of the weight of the fresh flower.

**Uses**

Jasmine flowers have been used since ancient
times in India for worship, ceremonial purposes,
incense and fumigants, as well as for making
perfumed hair oils, cosmetics and soaps.
Jasmine oil is an essential oil that is valued for
its soothing, relaxing, antidepressant qualities.

Jasmine blends well with other perfumes.
It is much used in modern perfumery and
cosmetics and has become popular in air
freshners, anti-perspirants, talcum powders,
shampoos and deodorants.

#### <u> 10.9 Traditional of Medicines Systems </u>

India has a rich medicinal heritage. A number
of Traditional Systems of Medicine (TSM)
are practiced in India some of which come
from outside India. TSM in India can be
broadly classified into **institutionalized**
or documented and **non-institutionalized**
or oral traditions. Institutionalized Indian
systems include Siddha and Ayurveda which
are practiced for about two thousand years.
These systems have prescribed texts in which
the symptoms, disease diagnosis, drugs to cure,
preparation of drugs, dosage and diet regimes,
daily and seasonal regimens. Non- institutional
systems, whereas, do not have such records
and or practiced by rural and tribal peoples
across India. The knowledge is mostly held in
oral form. The TSM focus on healthy lifestyle
and healthy diet for maintaining good health
and disease reversal.

**Siddha system of medicine**

Siddha is the most popular, widely practiced
and culturally accepted system in Tamil
Nadu. It is based on the texts written by 18
Siddhars. There are different opinions on the
constitution of 18 Siddhars. The Siddhars are
not only from Tamil Nadu, but have also come
from other countries. The entire knowledge is
documented in the form of poems in Tamil.
Siddha is principally based on the **Pancabūta**
philosophy. According to this system three
humors namely **Vātam, Pittam and Kapam**
that are responsible for the health of human
beings and any disturbance in the equilibrium
of these humors result in ill health. The drug
sources of Siddha include plants, animal parts,
marine products and minerals. This system
specializes in using minerals for preparing
drugs with the long shelf-life. This system
uses about 800 herbs as source of drugs. Great
stress is laid on disease prevention, health
promotion, rejuvenation and cure.

**Ayurveda system of medicine**

Ayurveda supposed to have originated from
Brahma. The core knowledge is documented
by **Charaka, Sushruta and Vagbhata** in
compendiums written by them. This system
is also based on three humor principles
namely, Vatha, Pitha and Kapha which would
exist in equilibrium for a healthy living. This
system Uses more of herbs and few animal
parts as drug sources. Plant sources include
a good proportion of Himalayan plants. The
**Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia** of India lists
about 500 plants used as source of drugs.

**Folk system of medicine**

Folk systems survive as an oral tradition among
innumerable rural and tribal communities
of India. A consolidated study to document
the plants used by ethnic communities was
launched by the Ministry of Environment and
Forests, Government of India in the form of
All India Coordinated Research Project on
Ethnobiology. As a result about 8000 plant
species have been documented which are
used for medicinal purposes. The efforts to
document in several under-explored and
unexplored pockets of India still continue.
Major tribal communities in Tamil Nadu who
are known for their medicinal knowledge
include **Irulas, Malayalis, Kurumbas,**
**Paliyans and Kaanis.** Some of the important
medicinal plants are discussed below.

#### 10.10 Medicinal Plants

India is a treasure house of medicinal plants.
They are linked to local heritage as well as to
global-trade. All institutional systems in India
primarily use medicinal plants as drug sources.
At present, 90% collection of medicinal plants
is from the non-cultivated sources. Growing
demand for herbal products has led to quantum
jump in volume of plant materials traded
within and across the countries. Increasing
demand exerts a heavy strain on the existing
resources. Now efforts are being made to
introduce cultivation techniques of medicinal
plants to the farmers.

Medicinal plants play a significant role in
providing primary health care services to rural
and tribal people. They serve as therapeutic
agents as well as important raw materials for
the manufacture of traditional and modern
medicines. Medicinally useful molecules
obtained from plants that are marketed as drugs
are called Biomedicines. Medicinal plants which
are marketed as powders or in other modified
forms are known as Botanical medicines.

**Keezhanelli**

*Botanical name : Phyllanthus amarus*

Family : Euphorbiaceae (Now in Phyllanthaceae)

**Origin and Area of cultivation:** The plant is
a native of Tropical American region and is
naturalised in India and other tropical countries.
It is not cultivated and is collected from moist
places in plains. Phyllanthus maderspatensis
is also commonly sold in the medicinal plant
markets collected from non-forest are as

**keezhanelli.**

**Active principle:** Phyllanthin is the major
chemical component.

**Medicinal importance**

Phyllanthus is a well-known hepato-protective
plant generally used in Tamil Nadu for the
treatment of Jaundice. Research carried out
by Dr. S P Thyagarajan and his team from
University of Madras has scientifically proved
that the extract of P. amarus is effective against
hepatitis B virus.


**Nilavembu**

Botanical name : *Andrographis paniculata*
Family : Acanthaceae
Andrographis paniculata, known as the
King of Bitters is traditionally used in Indian
systems of medicines.
Active principle: Andrographolides.
Medicinal importance:
Andrographis is a **potent hepatoprotective**
and is widely used to treat liver disorders.
Concoction of Andrographis paniculata and
eight other herbs (Nilavembu Kudineer) is
effectively used to treat malaria and dengue.


![Figure 10.19: Medicinal Plants](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic19.png)


**Psychoactive Drugs**

In the above chapter you have learnt about
plants that are used medicinally to treat
various diseases. Phytochemicals / drugs
from some of the plants alter an individual’s
perceptions of mind by producing
hallucination are known as psychoactive
drugs. These drugs are used in all ancient
culture especially by Shamans and by
traditional healers. Here we focus on two
such plants namely Poppy and Marijuana.

**Opium poppy**

Botanical name : *Papaver somniferum*
Family: Papaveraceae

**Origin and Area of cultivation:**

Opium poppy is native to South Eastern
Europe and Western Asia. Madhya Pradesh,
Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh are the licenced
states to cultivate opium poppy.


![](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic20.png)

Opium is derived from the exudates of
fruits of poppy plants. It was traditionally
used to induce sleep and for relieving pain.
Opium yields **Morphine,** a strong analgesic
which is used in surgery. However, opium is
an addiction forming drug.

**Cannabis / Marijuana**

*Botanical name : Cannabis sativa*
**Family: Cannabiaceae**

**Origin and Area of Cultivation:** Marijuana
is native to China. States such as Gujarat,
Himachal Pradesh, Uttarkand, Uttarpradesh
and Madhaya Pradesh have legally permitted
to cultivate industrial hemp/Marijuana
The active principle in Marijuana
is **trans-tetrahydrocanabinal** (THC). It
possess a number of medicinal properties.
It is an effective pain reliever and reduces
hypertension.

THC is used in treating
**Glaucoma** a condition in which pressure
develops in the eyes. THC is also used in
reducing nausea of cancer patients undergoing
radiation and chemotherapy. THC provides
relief to bronchial disorders, especially asthma
as it dilates bronchial vessels. Because of these
medicinal properties, cultivation of cannabis
is legalized in some countries. However,
prolonged use causes addiction and has an
effect on individual’s health and society.

Hence most of the countries have banned its
cultivation and use.

**10.11 Entrepreneurial Botany**

**Entrepreneurial Botany** is the study of
how new businesses are created using plant
resources as well as the actual process of
starting a new business. An **entrepreneur** is
someone who has an idea and who works to
create a product or service that people will
buy, by building an organization to support the
sales. **Entrepreneurship** is now a popular topic
for higher secondary students, with a focus on
developing ideas to create new ventures among
the young people.

Vast opportunities are there for the students of
Botany. In the present scenario students should
acquire ability to merge skills and knowledge
in a meaningful way. Converting botanical
knowledge into a business idea that can be
put into practice for earning a livelihood is the
much-needed training for the students.

Few
examples
for
activities
of
entrepreneurship are Mushroom cultivation,
Single cell protein (SCP) production, Seaweed
liquid fertilizer, Organic farming, Terrarium,
Bonsai and Cultivation of medicinal and
aromatic plants.

This part of the chapter is dealt about organic
farming in brief.

#### 10.11.1 Organic farming

Organic farming is an alternative agricultural
system in which plants/crops are cultivated
in natural ways by using biological inputs to
maintain soil fertility and ecological balance
thereby minimizing pollution and wastage.
Indians were organic farmers by default until
the green revolution came into practice.

Use of biofertilizers is one of the important
components of integrated organic farm
management, as they are cost effective
and renewable source of plant nutrients
to supplement the chemical fertilizers for
sustainable agriculture. Several microorganisms
and their association with crop plants are being
exploited in the production of biofertilizers.
Organic farming is thus considered as the
movement directed towards the philosophy of
**Back to Nature.**

#### I. Organic Pesticide

Pest like aphids, spider and mites can cause
serious damage to flowers, fruits, and vegetables.
These creatures attack the garden in swarms, and
drain the life of the crop and often invite disease
in the process. Many chemical pesticides prove
unsafe for human and the environment. It turns
fruits and vegetables unsafe for consumption.
Thankfully, there are many homemade, organic
options to turn to war against pests.

##### II. Bio-pest repellent

Botanical pest repellent and insecticide made
with the dried leaves of *Azadirachta indica*

**Preparation of Bio-pest repellent**

* 	Pluck leaves from the neem tree and chop
the leaves finely.

*   e chopped up leaves were put in a 50-liter
container and fill to half with water; put the
lid on and leave it for 3 days to brew.

*  sing another container, strain the mixture
which has brewed for 3 days to remove the
leaves, through fine mesh sieve. The filtrate
can be sprayed on the plants to repel pests.

* To make sure that the pest repellent sticks to
the plants, add 100 ml of
cooking oil and the same
amount of soap water.
(The role of the soap water
is to break down the oil,
and the role of the oil is to
make it stick to the leaves).

* The stewed leaves from the mixture can be
used in the compost heap or around the base
of the plants.

### Summary

Early civilization in different parts of the world
has domesticated different species of plants
for various purposes. Based on their utility,
the economically useful plants are classified
into food plants, fibre plants, timber plants,
medicinal plants, and plants used in paper
industries, dyes and cosmetics.

However, food base of majority of the
population depends on very few Cereals,
Millets, Pulses, Vegetables, Fruits, Nuts, Sugars,
Oil seeds, Beverages, Spices and Condiments.

Oils can be classified into two types
namely, essential oils and vegetable oils. Fatty
acids in oil may be saturated or unsaturated.
The oil yielding plants are groundnut and
sesame. The oils are used in cooking, making
soaps and other purposes. Beverages contain
alkaloids that stimulate central nervous
system. Spices were used throughout the
world for several years. Cardamom is ‘Queen
of Spices’ used for flavouring confectionaries
and beverages. Black pepper is King of Spices.


Botanically a fibre is a long, narrow, thick
walled cell. Cotton and Jute are fibre yielding
plants. Teak is wood used for making furniture.
Rubber is produced from the latex of Hevea
brasiliensis. Paper production is a Chinese
invention. Dyes have been used since ancient
times. The orange dye henna is from the leaves of
Lawsonia. Perfumes are volatile and aromatic in
nature, manufactured from essential oils which
are found at different parts of the plant. Medicinal
plants serve as therapeutic agents. Medicinally
useful molecules obtained from these plants
are marketed as drugs are called Biomedicines.
Whereas phytochemicals from some of the
plants which alter an individual’s perceptions of
mind by producing hallucination are known as
psychoactive drugs.


Entrepreneurial Botany is the study of
how new businesses are created using plant
resources as well as the actual process of
starting a new business.
