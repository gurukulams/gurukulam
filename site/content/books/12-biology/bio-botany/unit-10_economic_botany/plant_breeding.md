Economic botany is the study of the
relationship between people and economically
important plants. It explores the ways by
which humans use plants for food, medicines
and other uses. Economic botany intersects
many fields including established disciplines
such as agronomy, anthropology, archaeology,
chemistry, trade and commerce.

#### 9.1 R relationship between humans and plants

From the very early times, human beings have
co-existed with plants which played a vital
role in their survival. Through a long process
of trial and error, our ancestors have selected
hundreds of wild plants from the various
parts of the world for their specific use. The
knowledge of the plants and its applications
have led to the development of the humans and
their civilization in many ways.

### <u> 9.2 Domestication of plants </u>

Domestication is the process of bringing a
plant species under the control of humans and
gradually changing it through careful selection,
genetic alteration and handling so that it is more
useful to people. The domesticated species are
renewable sources that have provided food and
other benefits to human.
The possible changes in the plant species due
to domestication are listed below;

•	Adaptation to a greater diversity of
environments and a wider
geographical range.

•	Simultaneous /uniform flowering
and fruiting.

• Lack of shattering or scattering of seeds.

• Increased size of fruits and seeds.

• Change from a perennial to annual habit.

• Change in breeding system.

• Increased yield.

• Increased resistance for disease and pest.

• Developing seedless parthenocarpic
fruit.

• Enhancing colour, appearance,
palatability and nutritional composition.

#### <u> 9.3 Origin of Agriculture </u>

Archeological evidence for earliest record
of agriculture is found in the fertile crescent
region in and around Tigris and Euphrates river
valleys, approximately about 12,000 years ago.
The earlier Greek and Roman naturalists
like Theophrastus, Dioscorides, Pliny the elder
and Galen laid down the scientific foundation
in understanding origin and domestication of
cultivated plants.

#### <u> 9.4 Organic Agriculture </u>

Organic farming is an alternative agricultural
system which originated early in the twentieth
century in reaction to rapidly changing farming
practices. It is a production system that sustains
the health of the soils, ecosystems and people. It
relies on ecological processes, biodiversity and
cycles adapted to local conditions rather than
the use of inputs with adverse effects.

#### <u> 9.5.1. Biofertilizers </u>

Biofertilizers are defined as preparations
containing living cells or latent cells of
efficient strains of microorganisms that
help crop plants uptake of nutrients by
their interactions in the rhizosphere when
applied through seed or soil. Biofertilizers
could be also called as microbial cultures,
bioinoculants, bacterial inoculants or
bacterial fertilizers.


They are efficient in fixing nitrogen,
solubilising phosphate and decomposing
cellulose. They are designed to improve
the soil fertility, plant growth, and also the
number and biological activity of beneficial
microorganisms in the soil. They are eco-
friendly organic agro inputs and are more
efficient and cost effective than chemical
fertilizers.

![Figure 9.3: Classification of Biofertilizers](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic24.png)

**Rhizobium**

Bio-fertilisers containing rhizobium bacteria
are called *rhizobium* bio-fertilizer culture.
Symbiotic bacteria that reside inside the root
nodules convert the atmospheric nitrogen
into a bio available form to the plants. This
nitrogen fixing bacterium when applied to the
soil undergoes multiplication and fixes the
atmospheric nitrogen in the soil. *Rhizobium* is
best suited for the paddy fields which increase
the yield by 15 – 40%


![Figure 9.4 (a) : Root nodules occur on root (b) C.S. of Root nodule](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic25.png)

**Azolla**

*Azolla* is a free-floating water fern that fixes
the atmospheric nitrogen in association with
nitrogen fixing blue green alga Anabaena azolla.
It is used as a bio-fertilizer for wetland rice
cultivation and is known to contribute 40 – 60
kg/ha/crop. The agronomic potential of Azolla
is quite significant particularly for increasing the
yield of rice crop, as it quickly decompose in soil.


![Figure 9.5: (a) Azolla in paddy field (b) Azolla](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic27.png)


**Arbuscular mycorrhizae**

Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) is formed by
the symbiotic association between certain
phycomycetous fungi and angiosperm roots.
They have the ability to dissolve the phosphates
found in abundance in the soil.


![](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic26.png)


Apart from increasing the availability of
phosphorus, AM provides necessary strength to
resist disease, germs and unfavourable weather
conditions. It also assures water availability.

**Seaweed Liquid Fertilizer**

Seaweed liquid fertilizer (SLF) contains
cytokinin, gibberellins and auxin apart from
macro and micro nutrients. Most seaweed based
fertilizers are made from kelp(brown algae)
which grows to length of 150 metres. seaweed
Liquid fertilizer is
not only organic
but also eco-
friendly.

in the soil and
form long, cross-linked polymers in the soil.
These polymers improve the crumbing in the
soil, swell up when they get wet and retain
moisture for a long time. They are especially
useful in organic gardening which provides
carbohydrates for plants. Seaweed has more
than 70 minerals, vitamins and enzymes. It
promotes vigorous growth. Improves resistance
of plants to frost and disease. Seeds soaked in
seaweed extract germinate much rapidly and
develop a better root system.

**Bio-Pesticides**

Bio-pesticides are biological agents used for the
control of plant pests. They are in high use due
to their non-toxic, cheaper and eco-friendly
characteristics as compared to chemical or
synthetic pesticides. Bio-pesticides have become
an integral component of pest management in
terms of the environmental and health issues
attributed to the use of chemicals in agriculture.


**Trichoderma** species are free-living fungi
that are common in soil and root ecosystem.
They have been recognized as bio-control agent
for (1) the control of plant disease (2) ability
to enhance root growth development (3) crop
productivity (4) resistance to abiotic stress and
(5) uptake and use of nutrients.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic29.png) 

Beauveria species is an entomo-pathogenic
fungus that grows naturally in soils throughout
the world. It acts as a parasite on various
arthropod species causing white muscardine
disease without affecting the plant health and
growth. It also controls damping off of tomato
caused by **Rhizoctonia solani.**


**Green Manuring**

Green manuring is defined as the growing
of green manure crops and use of these crops
directly in the field by ploughing. One of the
main objectives of the green manuring is to
increase the content of nitrogen in the soil. Also
it helps in improving the structure and physical
properties of the soil. The most important green
manure crops are Crotalaria juncea, Tephrosia
purpurea, Indigofera tinctoria

The green manuring can be practised
as Green in-situ manuring or Green leaf
manuring. Green in-situ manuring refers to
the growing of green manuring crops in the
border rows or as intercrops along with the
main crops. Example: Sun hemp, Cowpea,
Green gram etc. whereas green leaf manuring
is the application of green leaves and twigs of
trees, shrubs, plants growing in wastelands
and field bunds. The important plant species
useful for green leaf manure are Cassia fistula,
Sesbania **grandiflora, Azadirachta indica,**
**Delonix regia, Pongamia** pinnata etc.

#### 9.6 Plant Breeding

Plant breeding is the science of improvement
of crop varieties with higher yield, better
quality, resistance to diseases and shorter
durations which are suitable to particular
environment. In other words, it is a purposeful
manipulation of plant species in order to
create desired genotype and phenotype for
the benefit of humans. In early days, plant
breeding activities were based mainly on
skills and ability of person involved. But as
the principles of genetics and cytogenetics
have elucidated breeding methods such as
selection, introduction, hybridization, ploidy,
mutation, tissue culture and biotechnology
techniques were designed to develop improved
crop varieties.


#### 9.6.1. Objectives of Plant Breeding

*  To increase yield, vigour and fertility of the crop.

* To increase tolerance to environmental
condition, salinity, temperature
and drought.

* To prevent the premature falling of buds,
fruits etc.

To improve synchronous maturity.

* To develop resistance to
pathogens and pests.

* To develop
photosensitive and
thermos-sensitive
varieties.

#### 9.7 Conventional Plant Breeding Methods

Conventional plant breeding methods resulting
in hybrid varieties had a tremendous impact on
agricultural productivity over the last decades.
It develops new plant varieties by the process
of selection and seeks to achieve expression of
genetic material which is already present within
the species. In this chapter we will discuss
about some of the conventional methods of
plant breeding.

### 9.7.1. Plant Introduction

Plant introduction may be defined as the
introduction of genotypes from a place where it is
normally grown to a new place or environment.
Rice variety of IR8 introduced from Philippines
and Wheat varieties of Sonora 63, Sonora 64
from Mexico.

The newly introduced plant has to adapt
itself to the new environment. This adjustment
or adaptation of the introduced plant in the
changed environment is called acclimatization.
All the introductions must be free from presence
of weeds, insects and disease causing organisms.
This has to be carefully examined by the process
called quarantine, a strict isolation imposed to
prevent the spread of disease.


Introduction may be classified as Primary
introduction and Secondary introduction

**(1) Primary introduction -** When the
introduced variety is well adapted to the new
environment without any alternation to the
original genotype.


**(2) Secondary introduction -** When the
introduced variety is subjected to selection to
isolate a superior variety and hybridized with a
local variety to transfer one or a few characters
to them. The botanical gardens in different
parts of the world also played a significant role
in plant introduction. Example : Tea varieties
collected from China and North East India
initially grown in Botanical Garden of Kolkata
from which appropriate clones have selected
and introduced to different parts of India.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic31.png) 

#### 9.7.2. Selection

Selection is the choice of certain individuals
from a mixed population for a one or more
desirable traits. Selection is the oldest and
basic method of plant breeding. There are two
main types of Selection.

**i. Natural Selection:** This is a rule in nature
and results in evolution reflected in the
Darwinian principle “survival of the fittest”.
It takes longer time in bringing about
desired variation.

**ii. Artificial Selection:**It is a human involved
process in having better crop from a mixed
population where the individuals differ in
character. The following are the three main
types of artificial selection.

**a. Mass Selection:** In mass selection a large
number of plants of similar phenotype or
morphological characters are selected and
their seeds are mixed together to constitute
a new variety. The population obtained
from the selected plants would be more
uniform than the original population and
are not individually tested. After repeated
selection for about five to six years, selected
seeds are multiplied and distributed to
the farmers. The only disadvantage of
mass selection is that it is difficult to
distinguish the hereditary variation from
of plants obtained as a result of repeated
self-pollination from a single homozygous
individual. Hence, a variety formed by this
method shows more homozygosity with
respect to all genes. The disadvantage of
this type is that the new genotypes are never
created and they are less adaptable and less
stable to the environmental fluctuations.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic32.png) 

**c. Clonal Selection:** In asexually propagated
crop, progenies derived from a plant
resemble in genetic constitution with the
parent plant as they are mitotically divided.
Based on their phenotypic appearance,
clonal selection is employed to select
improved variety from a mixed population
(clones). The selected plants are multiplied
through vegetative propagation to give rise
to a clone. The genotype of a clone remains
unchanged for a long period of time.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic33.png) 

### 9.7.3. Hybridization

Hybridization is the method of producing new
crop varieties in which two or more plants of
unlike genetically constitution is all crossed
together that result in a progeny called hybrid.
Hybridization offers improvement in crop and is
the only effective means of combining together
the desirable characters of two or more varieties
or species. The first natural hybridization was
observed by Cotton Mather in maize.

**Steps in Hybridization**

Steps involved in hybridization are as follows.

**1. Selection of Parents:** Male and female plants
of the desired characters are selected. Both
should be tested for their homozygosity.

**2. Emasculation:** It is a process of removal of
anthers to prevent self pollination before
dehiscence of anther.

**3. Bagging:** The stigma of the flower is
protected against any undesirable pollen
grains, by covering it with a bag .

![](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic34.png) 

**4. Crossing:** Transfer of pollen grains from
selected male flower to the stigma of the
female emasculated flower.


**5. Harvesting seeds and raising plants:** The
pollination leads to fertilization and finally
seed formation takes place. The seeds are
grown into new generation which are called
hybrids.


#### Types of Hybridization

According to the relationship between
plants, the hybridization is divided into.

**i. Intravarietal hybridization -** The cross
between the plants of same variety. Such
crosses are useful only in self-pollinated crops.

**ii. Intervarietal hybridization -** The cross
between the plants belonging to two
different varieties of the same species and is
also known as intraspecific hybridization.
This technique has been the basis of
improving self-pollinated as well as cross
pollinated crops


**iii. Interspecific hybridization -** The cross
between the plants belonging to different
species belonging to the same genus is
also called intragenic hybridization. It
is commonly used for transferring the
genes of disease, insect, pest and drought
resistance from one species to another.

Example: *Gossypium hirsutum x Gossypium arboreum* – Deviraj.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic35.png) 

**iv. Intergeneric hybridization –** The crosses
are made between the plants belonging to
two different genera. The disadvantages
are hybrid sterility, time consuming
and expensive procedure. Example:
Raphanobrassica, Triticale. (Refer chapter 4
for detailed illustration)


### 9.7.4. Heterosis

Heterosis (hetero- different; sis - condition)
G.H. Shull was the first scientist to use the
term heterosis in 1912. The superiority of
the F1 hybrid in performance over its parents
is called heterosis or hybrid vigour. Vigour
refers to increase in growth, yield, greater
adaptability of resistance to diseases, pest
and drought. Vegetative propagation is the
best suited measure for maintaining hybrid
vigour, since the desired characters are not
lost and can persist over a period of time.
Many breeders believe that the magnitude of
heterosis is directly related to the degree of
genetic diversity between the two parents.
Depending on the nature, origin, adaptability
and reproducing ability heterosis can be
classified as:
i. Euheterosis- This is the true heterosis which
is inherited and is further classified as:

**a.Mutational Euheterosis -** Simplest
type of euheterosis and results from the
sheltering or eliminating of the deleterious,
unfavourable often lethal, recessive,
mutant genes by their adaptively superior
dominant alleles in cross pollinated crops.


**b.Balanced Euheterosis** – Well balanced
gene combination which is more adaptive to
environmental conditions and agricultural
usefulness.

**ii.	 Pseudoheterosis** – Also termed as
luxuriance. Progeny possess superiority
over parents in vegetative growth but not
in yield and adaptation, usually sterile or
poorly fertile.

#### 9.7.5. Mutation Breeding

Muller and Stadler (1927- 1928) coined the
term mutation breeding. It represents a new
method of conventional breeding procedures
as they have the advantage of improving the
defect without losing agronomic and quality
character in agriculture and crop improvement.
Mutation means the sudden heritable
changes in the genotype or phenotype of an
organism. Gene mutations are of considerable
importance in plant breeding as they provide
essential inputs for evolution as well as for
re-combination and selection. It is the only
method for improving seedless crops.
Radiation such as UV short wave, X-ray,
Alpha (α), Beta (β), Gamma waves and many
chemicals such as cesium, EMS (ethyl methane
sulfonate), nitromethylurea induce mutation
to develop new varieties of crops. **Example:**
Triple gene dwarf wheat with increase in
yield and height. Atomita 2 - rice with salinity
tolerance and pest resistance.

### 9.7.6. Polyploid Breeding

Majority of flowering plants are diploid (2n).
The plants which possess more than two sets of
chromosome are called polyploids. Polyploidy
is a major force in the evolution of both
wild and cultivated plants. Polyploidy often
exhibits increased hybrid vigour, increased
heterozygosity, increase tolerance to both biotic
and abiotic stresses, buffering of deleterious
mutations. In addition, polyploidy often results
in reduced fertility due to meiotic error allowing
the production of seedless varieties.

      When chromosome number is doubled by
itself in the same plant, is called autopolyploidy.
Example: A triploid condition in sugarbeets,
apples and pear has resulted in the increase
in vigour and fruit size, large root size, large
leaves, flower, more seeds and sugar content
in them. It also resulted in seedless tomato,
apple, watermelon and orange. Polyploidy can
be induced by the use of colchicine to double
the chromosome number. Allopolyploids are
produced by multiplication of chromosome
sets that are initially derived from two different
species. Example: Triticale (Triticum durum
x secale cereale) Raphanobrassica *(Brassica oleraceae x Raphanus sativus)*

#### 9.7.7. Green Revolution

Green revolution the term was coined by William
S.Gaud in (1968). It is defined as the cumulative
result of a series of research, development,
innovation and technology transfer initiatives.
Agricultural production (especially wheat and
rice) manifolds worldwide particularly in the
developing countries between the 1940’s and
the late 1960’s.

The Green revolution or third Agricultural
Revolution is the intensive plan of 1960’s to
increase crop yield in developing countries
by introducing the high yielding, resistant
varieties, increased irrigation facilities, fertilizer
application and better agricultural management.
In 1963 semi-dwarf wheat of Mexico
was introduced from which India got five
prolonged strategies for breeding a wide range
of high varieties like Sonora 64, Sonalika and
Kalyansona possessing a broad spectrum of
resistance to major biotic and abiotic condition.
Same as wheat M.S.Swaminathan produced the
first semi-dwarf fertiliser responsive hybrid
variety of rice TNI (Taichung Native-1) in 1956
from Taiwan. The derivatives were introduced in
1966. Later better yielding semi dwarf varieties
of rice Jaya and Ratna developed in India.

{{< box title="Do You Know?? " type="objective" >}}

NORIN 10 – The cultivars
found that Norin 10
dwarfing genes have high
photosynthetic rate per unit
leaf area and increase respiratory activity.
Gonjiro Inazuka selected the semi-dwarf
wheat variety that became Norin 10. He
would have never thought that the semi
dwarf genes would not only revolutionize
the world of wheat but also helped to save
more than one billion lives from hunger
and starvation.

### Plant Breeding for Developing Resistance to diseases

Some crop varieties bred by hybridization
and selection, for disease resistance to fungi,
bacteria and viral diseases are released (Table 9.1).

![](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic36.png) 

**Norman E. Borlaug:** The plant pathologist
plant breeder devoted his life at the International
Maize and Wheat improvement centre at
Sonord in Mexico. He developed a new high
yielding, rust resistant, non-lodging dwarf
wheat varieties like Norin-10, Sonora-64, Lerma
rojo-64, etc. which are now being cultivated in
many countries. This formed
the base for ‘green revolution’.
He was awarded a Nobel prize
for Peace in 1970.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic37.png) 

**Dr. M. S. Swaminathan:** He
is a pioneer mutation breeder.
He has produced Sharbati Sonora, is the amber
grain coloured variety of wheat by mutation,
which is responsible for green revolution in India.
Dr. Swaminathan is called
“Father of green revolution
in India”.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic38.png) 

**Nel Jayaraman:**
Mr.
Jayaraman,
hails
from
Adirangam village in Tiruvarur district. He
was a disciple of Dr.Nammalvar and state co-
ordinator of ‘Save our rice campaign, Tamil
Nadu. He strived hard for conservation of
traditional rice varieties. He had trained a team
of farmers and regularly update them on the
current issues that affect them.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic39.png) 

In 2005, he organized a first ever
traditional
paddy
seed
festival in his farm as an
individual. The seed festival
in May 2016 at Adhirangam
was 10th in a row and
in which 156 different
traditional varieties were distributed to more
than 7000 farmers across Tamil Nadu. He was
invited by the Philippines Government to
give a talk at the International Rice Research
Institute (IRRI) on his work and mission. In
2011, he received the State Award for best
organic farmer for his contribution to organic
farming, and in the year 2015, he received the
National Award for best Genome Savior.

Resistance to yellow mosaic virus in bhindi
*(Abelmoschus escullentus)* was transferred from
a wild species and resulted in a new variety of
A. Escullentus called Parbharni kranti.

**Plant Breeding for Developing Resistance to Insect Pests**

Insect resistance in
host crop plants may be
due
to
morphological,
biochemical or physiological
characteristics. Hairy leaves
in several plants are associated
with resistance to insect pests.
Example: resistance to jassids in cotton and
cereal leaf beetle in wheat. In wheat, solid stems
lead to non-preference by the stem sawfly and
smooth leaves and nectar-less cotton varieties
do not attract bollworms. High aspartic acid,
low nitrogen and sugar content in maize leads
to resistance to maize stem borers.

**9.8 Modern Plant Breeding**

In the milestones of plant breeding methods
Genetic Engineering, Plant tissue culture,
Protoplasmic fusion or somatic hybridisation,
Molecular marking and DNA finger printing are
some of the modern plant breeding tools used
to improve the crop varieties. We have already
discussed about the various techniques and
application of the above mentioned concepts in
Unit VIII.
