Economic botany is the study of the
relationship between people and economically
important plants. It explores the ways by
which humans use plants for food, medicines
and other uses. Economic botany intersects
many fields including established disciplines
such as agronomy, anthropology, archaeology,
chemistry, trade and commerce.

#### 9.1 R relationship between humans and plants

From the very early times, human beings have
co-existed with plants which played a vital
role in their survival. Through a long process
of trial and error, our ancestors have selected
hundreds of wild plants from the various
parts of the world for their specific use. The
knowledge of the plants and its applications
have led to the development of the humans and
their civilization in many ways.

### <u> 9.2 Domestication of plants </u>

Domestication is the process of bringing a
plant species under the control of humans and
gradually changing it through careful selection,
genetic alteration and handling so that it is more
useful to people. The domesticated species are
renewable sources that have provided food and
other benefits to human.
The possible changes in the plant species due
to domestication are listed below;

•	Adaptation to a greater diversity of
environments and a wider
geographical range.

•	Simultaneous /uniform flowering
and fruiting.

• Lack of shattering or scattering of seeds.

• Increased size of fruits and seeds.

• Change from a perennial to annual habit.

• Change in breeding system.

• Increased yield.

• Increased resistance for disease and pest.

• Developing seedless parthenocarpic
fruit.

• Enhancing colour, appearance,
palatability and nutritional composition.

#### <u> 9.3 Origin of Agriculture </u>

Archeological evidence for earliest record
of agriculture is found in the fertile crescent
region in and around Tigris and Euphrates river
valleys, approximately about 12,000 years ago.
The earlier Greek and Roman naturalists
like Theophrastus, Dioscorides, Pliny the elder
and Galen laid down the scientific foundation
in understanding origin and domestication of
cultivated plants.

#### <u> 9.4 Organic Agriculture </u>

Organic farming is an alternative agricultural
system which originated early in the twentieth
century in reaction to rapidly changing farming
practices. It is a production system that sustains
the health of the soils, ecosystems and people. It
relies on ecological processes, biodiversity and
cycles adapted to local conditions rather than
the use of inputs with adverse effects.

#### <u> 9.5.1. Biofertilizers </u>

Biofertilizers are defined as preparations
containing living cells or latent cells of
efficient strains of microorganisms that
help crop plants uptake of nutrients by
their interactions in the rhizosphere when
applied through seed or soil. Biofertilizers
could be also called as microbial cultures,
bioinoculants, bacterial inoculants or
bacterial fertilizers.


They are efficient in fixing nitrogen,
solubilising phosphate and decomposing
cellulose. They are designed to improve
the soil fertility, plant growth, and also the
number and biological activity of beneficial
microorganisms in the soil. They are eco-
friendly organic agro inputs and are more
efficient and cost effective than chemical
fertilizers.

**Rhizobium**

Bio-fertilisers containing rhizobium bacteria
are called *rhizobium* bio-fertilizer culture.
Symbiotic bacteria that reside inside the root
nodules convert the atmospheric nitrogen
into a bio available form to the plants. This
nitrogen fixing bacterium when applied to the
soil undergoes multiplication and fixes the
atmospheric nitrogen in the soil. *Rhizobium* is
best suited for the paddy fields which increase
the yield by 15 – 40%

**Azolla**

*Azolla* is a free-floating water fern that fixes
the atmospheric nitrogen in association with
nitrogen fixing blue green alga Anabaena azolla.
It is used as a bio-fertilizer for wetland rice
cultivation and is known to contribute 40 – 60
kg/ha/crop. The agronomic potential of Azolla
is quite significant particularly for increasing the
yield of rice crop, as it quickly decompose in soil.

**Arbuscular mycorrhizae**

Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) is formed by
the symbiotic association between certain
phycomycetous fungi and angiosperm roots.
They have the ability to dissolve the phosphates
found in abundance in the soil.

Apart from increasing the availability of
phosphorus, AM provides necessary strength to
resist disease, germs and unfavourable weather
conditions. It also assures water availability.

Seaweed Liquid Fertilizer
Seaweed liquid fertilizer (SLF) contains
cytokinin, gibberellins and auxin apart from
macro and micro nutrients. Most seaweed based
fertilizers are made from kelp(brown algae)
which grows to length of 150 metres. seaweed
Liquid fertilizer is
not only organic
but also eco-
friendly.

in the soil and
form long, cross-linked polymers in the soil.
These polymers improve the crumbing in the
soil, swell up when they get wet and retain
moisture for a long time. They are especially
useful in organic gardening which provides
carbohydrates for plants. Seaweed has more
than 70 minerals, vitamins and enzymes. It
promotes vigorous growth. Improves resistance
of plants to frost and disease. Seeds soaked in
seaweed extract germinate much rapidly and
develop a better root system.

Bio-Pesticides
Bio-pesticides are biological agents used for the
control of plant pests. They are in high use due
to their non-toxic, cheaper and eco-friendly
characteristics as compared to chemical or
synthetic pesticides. Bio-pesticides have become
an integral component of pest management in
terms of the environmental and health issues
attributed to the use of chemicals in agriculture.
Trichoderma species are free-living fungi
that are common in soil and root ecosystem.
They have been recognized as bio-control agent
for (1) the control of plant disease (2) ability
to enhance root growth development (3) crop
productivity (4) resistance to abiotic stress and
(5) uptake and use of nutrients.
