Growing plant
protoplasts, cells, tissues
or organs away from
their natural or normal
environment, under
artificial condition, is
known as Tissue Culture.
It is also known as in vitro
(In vitro is a Latin word,
it means that - in glass
or in test-tube) growth of plant protoplasts,
cells, tissues and organs. A single explant can
be multiplied into several thousand plants in
a short duration and space under controlled 
conditions.

Tissue culture techniques are often used
for commercial production of plants as well as
for plant research. Plant tissue culture serves
as an indispensable tool for regeneration of
transgenic plants. Apart from this some of
the main applications of Plant tissue culture
are clonal propagation of elite varieties,
conservation of endangered plants, production
of virus-free plants, germplasm preservation,
industrial production of secondary metabolites.
etc., In this chapter let us discuss the history ,
techniques, types , applications of plant tissue
culture and get awareness on ethical issues.

Gottlieb Haberlandt (1902) the German
Botanist proposed the concept **Totipotency**
and he was also the first person to culture plant
cells in artificial conditions using the mesophyll
cells of Lamium purpureum in culture medium
and obtained cell proliferation. He is regarded
as the father of tissue culture.

### 5.1 Basic concepts of Tissue Culture

Basic concepts of plant tissue culture are
totipotency, differentiation, dedifferentiation
and redifferentiation.

#### Totipotency

The property of live plant cells that they
have the genetic potential when cultured in
nutrient medium to give rise to a complete
individual plant.

#### Differentiation

The process of biochemical and structural
changes by which cells become specialized in
form and function.


![Figure 5.1: Totipotency](/books/12-biology/botany/unit8/img2.png )

#### Redifferentiation

The further differentiation of already
differentiated cell into another type of cell.
For example, when the component cells of
callus have the ability to form a whole plant in
a nutrient medium, the phenomenon is called
redifferentiation.

#### Dedifferentiation

The phenomenon of the reversion of mature
cells to the meristematic state leading to the
formation of callus is called dedifferentiation.
These two phenomena of redifferentiation and
dedifferentiation are the inherent capacities of
living plant cells or tissue. This is described as
totipotency. 

### 5.2 Plant Tissue Culture (PTC)

Plant tissue culture is used to describe the in
*vitro* and aseptic growth of any plant part on a
tissue culture medium. This technology is based
on three fundamental principles:

*	 The plant part or explant must be selected
and isolated from the rest of plant body.

*	 The explant must be maintained in controlled
physically (environmental) and chemically
defined (nutrient medium) conditions.

 Aseptic condition must be maintained,
which requires high degree of cleanliness in
the laboratory.

**Explant:**  The tissue taken from a selected
plant transferred to a culture medium often
to establish a new plant.

### 5.2.1 Laboratory Facilities for PTC 

For PTC, the laboratory must have the following
facilities:

![Figure 5.2: Tissue culture lab](/books/12-biology/botany/unit8/img3.png )


* Washing facility for glassware and ovens for
drying glassware.

* Medium preparation room with autoclave,
electronic balance and pH meter.

* Transfer area sterile room with laminar
air-flow bench and a positive pressure
ventilation unit called High Efficiency
Particulate Air (HEPA) filter to maintain
aseptic condition.

* Culture facility: Growing the explant
inoculated into culture tubes at 22-28° C
with illumination of light 2400 lux, with a
photoperiod of 8-16 hours and a relative
humidity of about 60%.

### 5.3.2 Technique Involved in PTC

#### 1. Sterilization:

Sterilization is the technique employed to get
rid of microbes such as bacteria and fungi in the
culture medium, vessels and explants.

#### i. Maintenance of Aseptic Environment:

During in vitro tissue culture maintenance of
aseptic environmental condition should be
followed, i.e., sterilization of glassware, forceps,
scalpels, and all accessories in wet steam
sterilization by autoclaving at 15 psi (121°C)
for 15 to 30 minutes or dipping in 70% ethanol
followed by flaming and cooling.

**ii. Sterilization of culture room:** 
Floor and
walls are washed first with detergent and then
with 2% sodium hypochlorite or 95% ethanol.
The cabinet of laminar airflow is sterilized by
clearing the work surface with 95% ethanol and
then exposure of UV radiation for 15 minutes.


**iii. Sterilization of Nutrient Media:** Culture
media are dispensed in glass containers, plugged
with non-absorbent cotton or sealed with plastic
closures and then sterilized using autoclave at
15 psi (121°C) for 15 to 30 minutes. The plant
extracts, vitamins, amino acids and hormones
are sterilized by passing through Millipore filter
with 0.2 mm pore diameter and then added
to sterilized culture medium inside Laminar
Airflow Chamber under sterile condition.

![Figure 5.3: Basic steps in Plant tissue culture technology](/books/12-biology/botany/unit8/img4.png )

**iv. Sterilization of Explants:** The plant
materials to be used for tissue culture should be
surface sterilized by first exposing the material
in running tap water and then treating it in
surface sterilization agents like 0.1% mercuric
chloride, 70% ethanol under aseptic condition
inside the Laminar Air Flow Chamber.

**2. Media Preparation**

The success of tissue culture lies in the
composition of the growth medium, plant
growth regulators and culture conditions
such as temperature, pH, light and humidity.
No single medium is capable of maintaining
optimum growth of all plant tissues. Suitable
nutrient medium as per the principle of tissue
culture is prepared and used.

MS nutrient medium (Murashige and Skoog
1962) is commonly used. It has carbon sources,
with suitable vitamins and hormones. The media
formulations available for plant tissue culture
other than MS are B5 medium (Gamborg.et.al
1968), White medium (white 1943), Nitsch’s
medium (Nitsch & Nitsch 1969). A medium may
be solid or semisolid or liquid. For solidification,
a gelling agent such as agar is added.

**Agar:** A complex mucilaginous polysaccharide
obtained from marine algae (sea weeds) used
as solidifying agent in media preparation.

### 3. Culture condition

**pH**

The pH of medium is normally adjusted between
5.6 to 6.0 for the best result.

**Temperature**

The cultures should be incubated normally at
constant temperature of 25°C ± 2°C for optimal
growth.

**Humidity and Light Intensity**

The cultures require 50-60% relative humidity
and 16 hours of photoperiod by the illumination
of cool white fluorescent tubes of approximately
1000 lux.

**Aeration**

Aeration to the culture can be provided by
shaking the flasks or tubes of liquid culture on
automatic shaker or aeration of the medium by
passing with filter-sterilized air.


4. Induction of Callus
Explant of 1-2 cm
sterile
segment
selected from leaf,
stem,
tuber
or
root is inoculated
(transferring
the
explants to sterile
glass tube containing
nutrient
medium)

![Figure 5.4: Induction of callus ](/books/12-biology/botany/unit8/img5.png )


in the MS nutrient medium supplemented
with auxins and incubated at 25°C ± 2°C in an
alternate light and dark period of 12 hours to
induce cell division and soon the upper surface
of explant develops into callus. Callus is a mass
of unorganized growth of plant cells or tissues
in in vitro culture medium.
