Biotechnology is the science of applied biological processes. In other words it is science of development and utilization of biological processes, forms and systems for the benefit of mankind and other life forms. The term biotechnology was coined by Karl Ereky, a Hungarian Engineer in 1919 and has been extended to include any process in which organisms, tissues, cells ,organelles or isolated molecules such as enzymes are used to convert biological or other raw materials to products of greater value.

#### 4.1 Development of Biotechnology

Biotechnology has developed by leaps and bounds during the past century and its development can be well understood under two main heads namely **conventional or traditional biotechnology and modern biotechnology** 

**1. Conventional or traditional biotechnology:** 

This is the kitchen technology developed by our ancestors, and it is as old as human civilization. It uses bacteria and other microbes in the daily usage for preparation of dairy products like curd, ghee, cheese and in preparation of foods like idli, dosa, nan, bread and pizza. This conventional biotechnology also extends to preparation of alcoholic beverages like beer, wine, etc. With the advancement of the science and technology during the 18th century, these kitchen technologies gained scientific validation.

**2. Modern biotechnology**

There are two main features of this technology,
that differentiated it from the conventional
technology they are i) ability to change the
genetic material for getting new products with
specific requirement through recombinant
DNA technology ii) ownership of the newly
developed technology and its social impact.
Today, biotechnology is a billion dollar business
around the world, where in pharmaceutical
companies, breweries, agro industries and
other biotechnology based industries apply
biotechnological tools for their product
improvement.

Modern biotechnology embraces all methods
of genetic modification by recombinant DNA
and cell fusion technology. The major focus of
biotechnology are

- **Fermentation** for production of acids,
enzymes, alcohols, antibiotics, fine
chemicals, vitamins and toxins

- **Biomass for** bulk production of single cell
protein , alcohol, and biofuel

- **Enzymes** as biosensors, in processing
industry

- **Biofuels** for production of hydrogen,
alcohol, methane

- **Microbial inoculants** as biofertiliser, and
nitrogen fixers

- **Plant and animal cell culture** for production
of secondary metabolites, monoclonal
antibodies

- **Recombinant DNA technology** for production of fine chemicals, enzymes,
vaccines, growth hormones, antibiotics, and
interferon

- **Process engineering** – tools of
biotechnology is used for effluent treatment,
water recycling.
This unit will reveal the various aspects of
modern biotechnology, its products and
applications.


#### 4.2. Methods of Biotechnology

##### 4.2.1 Fermentation

The word fermentation is derived from the
Latin verb ‘fervere’ which means ‘ to boil’.
Fermentation refers to the metabolic process
in which organic molecules (normally glucose)
are converted into acids, gases, or alcohol in
the absence of oxygen or any electron transport
chain. The study of fermentation, its practical
uses is called zymology and originated in
1856, when French chemist Louis Pasteur
demonstrated that fermentation was caused
by yeast. Fermentation occurs in certain types
of bacteria and fungi that require an oxygen-
free environment to live. The processes of
fermentation are valuable to the food and
beverage industries, with the conversion
of sugar into ethanol to produce alcoholic
beverages, the release of CO2 by yeast used in the
leavening of bread, and with the production of
organic acids to preserve and flavor vegetables
and dairy products.

###### Bioreactor (Fermentor)

Bioreactor (Fermentor) is a vessel or a
container that is designed in such a way that
it can provide an optimum environment in
which microorganisms or their enzymes
interact with a substrate to produce the
required product. In the bioreactor aeration,
agitation, temperature and pH are controlled.
Fermentation involves two process.

**i. Upstream process**

All the process before starting of the fermenter
such as sterilization of the fermenter,
preparation and sterilization of culture
medium and growth of the suitable inoculum
are called upstream process.

**ii. Downstream process**

All the process after the fermentation process
is known as the downstream process. This
process includes distillation, centrifuging,filtration and solvent extraction. Mostly
this process involves the purification of the
desired product.

**figure 4.2**

###### Procedure of Fermentation


a. Depending upon the type of product, bioreactor is selected.

b. A suitable substrate in liquid medicine is
added at a specific temperature, pH and
then diluted.
The organism (microbe, animal/plant

c. cell, sub-cellular organelle or enzyme) is
added to it.
Then it is incubated at a specific

d. temperature for the specified time.

e. The incubation may either be aerobic or
anaerobic.

f. Withdrawal of product using downstream
processing methods

###### Application of fermentation in industries

Fermentation has industrial application such as:

**1. Microbial biomass production**

Microbial cells (biomass) like algae, bacteria,
yeast, fungi are grown, dried and used as
source of a complete protein called ‘single cell
protein (SCP)’ which serves as human food or
animal feed.

**2. Microbial metabolites**

Microbes produce compounds that are very useful to man and animals. These compounds
called metabolites, can be grouped into two
categories:

**a. Primary metabolites:**

Metabolites produced for the maintenance of life
process of microbes are known as primary
metabolites Eg. Ethanol, citric, acid, lactic
acid, acetic acid.

**b. Secondary metabolites:**

Secondary
metabolites are those which are not
required for the vital life process of
microbes, but have value added nature, this
includes antibiotics e.g -Amphotericin-B
(Streptomyces
nodosus),
Penicillin
(Penicillium chryosogenum) Streptomycin
(S. grises) , Tetracycline (S. aureofacins),
alkaloids, toxic pigments, vitamins etc.

**3. Microbial enzymes**

When microbes are cultured, they secrete some enzymes into the growth media. These
enzymes are industrially used in detergents,
food processing, brewing and pharmaceuticals.
Eg. protease, amylase, isomerase, and lipase.

**4. Bioconversion, biotransformation or modification of the substrate**

The fermenting microbes have the capacity to
produce valuable products, eg. conversion of
ethanol to acetic acid (vinegar), isopropanol to
acetone, sorbitol to sorbose (this is used in the
manufacture of vitamin C), sterols to steroids.

##### 4.2.2 Single Cell Protein (SCP)

Single cell proteins are dried cells of
microorganism that are used as protein
supplement in human foods or animal
feeds. Single Cell Protein (SCP) offers
an unconventional but plausible solution
to protein deficiency faced by the entire
humanity. Although single cell protein has
high nutritive value due to their higher
protein, vitamin, essential amino acids and
lipid content, there are doubts on whether it
could replace conventional protein sources due to its high nucleic acid content and
slower in digestibility. Microorganisms used
for the production of Single Cell Protein are
as follows:

- Bacteria - Methylophilus methylotrophus, Cellulomonas, Alcaligenes

- Fungi - Agaricus campestris, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Candida utilis

- Algae - Spirulina, Chlorella, Chlamydomonas

The single cell protein forms an important
source of food because of their protein content,
carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals. It is
used by Astronauts and Antarctica expedition
scientists.

**figure 4.3**

Spirulina
can
be grown easily on
materials like waste
water from potato
processing
plants
(containing starch),
straw,
molasses,
animal manure and
even sewage, to produce large quantities and
can serve as food rich in protein, minerals, fats,
carbohydrate and vitamins. Such utilization
also reduces environmental pollution. 250 g
of Methylophilus methylotrophus, with a high
rate of biomass production and growth, can
be expected to produce 25 tonnes of protein.

**Applications of Single-Cell Protein**

- It is used as protein supplement

- It is used in cosmetics products for healthy hair and skin

- It is used as the excellent source of protein for feeding cattle, birds, fishes etc.

- It is used in food industry as aroma carriers, vitamin carrier, emulsifying agents to improve the nutritive value of baked products, in soups, in  ready-to-serve-meals, in diet recipes

- It is used in industries like paper processing, leather processing as foam stabilizers.

#### 4.3 Advancements in Modern Biotechnology

Modern biotechnology embraces all the
genetic manipulations, protoplasmic fusion
techniques and the improvements made in
the old biotechnological processes. Some
of the major advancements in modern
biotechnology are described below.

##### 4.3.1 Genetic Engineering

Genetic engineering or recombinant DNA
technology or gene cloning is a collective term
that includes different experimental protocols
resulting in the modification and transfer of
DNA from one organism to another.

The definition for conventional
recombination was already given in Unit
II. Conventional recombination involves
exchange or recombination of genes between
homologous chromosomes during meiosis.
Recombination carried out artificially using
modern technology is called recombinant
DNA technology (r-DNA technology). It is
also known as gene manipulation technique.
This technique involves the transfer of DNA
coding for a specific gene from one organism
into another organism using specific
agents like vectors or using instruments
like electroporation, gene gun, liposome
mediated, chemical mediated transfers and
microinjection.

##### 4.3.2 Steps involved in Recombinant DNA Technology 

**The steps involved in recombinant DNA technology are:**

- Isolation of a DNA fragment containing a gene of interest that needs to be cloned. This is called an insert. 

PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction is a common
laboratory technique used to make copies
(millions) of a particular region of DNA.

- Generation of recombinant DNA (rDNA) molecule by insertion of the DNA fragment into a carrier molecule called a vector that can self-replicate within the host cell.

**figure 4.4**

- Selection of the transformed host cells is carrying the rDNA and allowing them to multiply thereby multiplying the rDNA molecule.

- The entire process thus generates either a large amount of rDNA or a large amount of protein expressed by the insert.

- Wherever vectors are not involved the desired gene is multiplied by PCR technique. The multiple copies are injected into the host cell protoplast or it is shot into the host cell protoplast by shot gun method.

#### 4.4 Tools for Genetic Engineering

In order to generate recombinant DNA molecule, certain basic tools are necessary. The basic tools
are enzymes, vectors and host
organisms. The most important
enzymes required for genetic
engineering are the restriction
enzymes, DNA ligase and
alkaline phosphatase.

##### 4.4.1 Restriction Enzymes

The two enzymes responsible
for restricting the growth of
bacteriophage in Escherichia coli
were isolated in the year 1963.
One was the enzyme which added
methyl groups to DNA, while the
other cut DNA. The latter was
called restriction endonuclease.
A  **restriction**  enzyme
or  **restriction endonuclease**  is
an enzyme that cleaves DNA
into fragments at or near
specific recognition sites
within the molecule known
as  **restriction**  sites. Based on
their mode of action restriction
enzymes are classified into Exonucleases and
Endonucleases.

a. Exonucleases are enzymes which remove
nucleotides one at a time from the end of a
DNA molecule. e.g. Bal 31, Exonuclease III.

b. Endonucleases are enzymes which break
the internal phosphodiester bonds within a DNA molecule. e.g. Hind II, EcoRI, Pvul,
BamHI, TaqI.
