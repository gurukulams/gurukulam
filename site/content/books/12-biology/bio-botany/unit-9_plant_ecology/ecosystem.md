Have you seen lakes, ponds and pools in your
surroundings? They are all called water bodies
with many components in them. Can you list
out the things which are found in water bodies?
Mud, nutrients, clay, dissolved gases, planktons,
microorganisms, plants like algae, *Hydrilla*,
**Nelumbo*, *Nymphaea* and animals like snake,
small fish, large fish, frog, tortoise and crane
are the components of the water bodies which
constitutes **ecosystem**. Further, we all know
that plants and animals are prominent living
components in the environment. They interact
with space components such as air, water, soil,
sunlight, etc. For example, you have studied in
class XI, one of the life processes, photosynthesis
which utilizes sunlight , water, carbondioxide,
nutrients from the soil and release oxygen to
the atmosphere. From this, we understand that
the exchange of materials takes place between
living and space components. Likewise, you
can study the structure, function and types of
ecosystem in this chapter. The term **‘ecosystem’**
was proposed by A.G. Tansley (1935), who
defined it as ‘**the system resulting from **the**
**integration of all the living and nonliving**
**factors** of the environment**’. Whereas, Odum
(1962) defined ecosystem ‘**as the structural and functional unit of ecology**’.



![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/1.9.png )




#### 7.1  Structure of ecosystem



Ecosystem comprises of two major components.
They are:



i)**Abiotic (non-living) components**: It
includes climatic factors (air, water,
sunlight, rainfall, temperature and
humidity), edaphic factors (soil air,
soil water and pH of soil),topography
(latitude, altitude), organic components
(carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and humic
substances) and inorganic substances (C,
H, O, N and P ). Abiotic components play
vital role in any ecosystem and hence the
total inorganic substances present in any
ecosystem at a given time is called **standing**
**quality** (or) **standing** **state**.



ii)	**Biotic (living) components**: It includes
all living organisms like plants, animals,
fungi and bacteria. They form the trophic
structures of any ecosystem. On the basis
of nutritional relationships, trophic levels
of an ecosystem have two components.
(1) autotrophic components and (2)
heterotrophic components.




(1) **Autotrophic components**: Autotrophs
are organisms which can manufacture the
organic compounds from simple inorganic
components through a process called photosynthesis. In most of the ecosystems,
green plants are the autotrophs and are also
called **producers**.




(2) **Heterotrophic components**: Those
organisms which consume the producers are
called **consumers** and can be recognized into
macro and micro consumers. **Macroconsumers**
refer to herbivores, carnivores and omnivores
(primary, secondary and tertiary consumers).
**Microconsumers** are called decomposers.
Decomposers are organisms that decompose
the dead plants and animals to release organic
and inorganic nutrients into the environment
which are again reused by plants. Example:
Bacteria, Actinomycetes and Fungi.


The amount of living materials present
in a population at any given time is known
as **standing** **crop**, which may be expressed
in terms of number or biomass per unit area.
**Biomass** can be measured as fresh weight or
dry weight or carbon weight of organisms.
Biotic components are essential to construct the
food chain, food web and ecological pyramids.



#### 7.2 Functions of ecosystem


The function of ecosystem include creation of
energy creation, sharing of energy and cycling
of materials between the living and nonliving
components of an ecosystem.



Before studying the productivity in any
ecosystem, we should understand the essential
role of sunlight used by producers of the first
trophic level. The quantity of sunlight is directly
proportional to the production of energy by plants.


#### 7.2.1 Photosynthetically Radiation (PAR) Active



The amount of light available for photosynthesis
of plants is called **P**hotosynthetically **A**ctive
**R**adiation (PAR) which is from of 400-700 nm
in wave length. It is essential for photosynthesis
and plant growth. PAR is not always constant
because of clouds, tree shades, air, dust particles,
seasons, latitudes and length of the daylight
availability. Generally plants absorb more blue
and red light for efficient photosynthesis.




Of the total sunlight, 34 percent that reaches
the atmosphere is reflected back into the
atmosphere, moreover 10% is held by ozone,
water vapours and atmospheric gases and the
remaining 56% reaches the earth’s surface. Out
of this 56%, only 2 – 10% of the solar energy is
used by green plants for photosynthesis while
the remaining portion is dissipated as heat.




PAR is generally expressed in millimoles /
square meter / second by using silicon photo
voltic detectors which detect only 400 – 700
nm wavelength of light. PAR values range from
0 to 3000 millimoles /square meter / second.



At night PAR is zero and during midday in
the summer, PAR often reaches 2000 – 3000
millimoles /square meter/second.


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/2.9.png )



#### 7.2.2 Productivity of an ecosystem



The rate of biomass production per unit area
in a unit time is called productivity. It can be
expressed in terms of gm /m 2 /year or Kcal/m 2 /
year. It is classified as given bellow.


1. Primary productivity



2. Secondary productivity



3. Community productivity



1. **Primary productivity**:


The chemical energy or organic matter
generated by autotrophs during the process
of photosynthesis and chemosynthesis is
called **primary** **productivity**. It is the source
of energy for all organisms, from bacteria to
human.



**a. Gross Primary Productivity (GPP)**



The total amount of food energy or organic
matter or biomass produced in an ecosystem by
autotrophs through the process of photosynthesis.
is called **gross** **primary** **productivity**



**b. Net Primary Productivity (NPP)**
The proportion of energy which remains
after respiration loss in the plant is called **net primary productivity**. It is also called as
apparent photosynthesis. Thus the difference
between GPP and respiration is known as NPP.



NPP = GPP – Respiration



NPP of whole biosphere is estimated to be
about 170 billion tons (dry weight) per year.
Out of which NPP of oceanic producers is
only 55 billion tons per year in unit time.


##### 2. Secondary productivity



The amount of energy stored in the tissues of
heterotrophs or consumers is called **secondary**
**productivity**.



**a. Gross secondary productivity**



It is equivalent to the total amount of plant
material is ingested by the herbivores minus
the materials lost as faeces.




**b. Net secondary productivity**


Storage of energy or biomass by consumers
per unit area per unit time, after respiratory
loss is called **net secondary productivity**.



##### 3. Community productivity


The rate of net synthesis of organic matter
(biomass) by a group of plants per unit
area per unit time is known as **community**
**productivity**.


**Factors affecting primary productivity**


Primary productivity depends upon the
plant species of an area, their photosynthetic
capacity, availability of nutrients, solar
radiation, precipitation, soil type, topographic
factors (altitude, latitude, direction), and other
environmental factors. It varies in different
types of ecosystems.



#### 7.2.3 Concept of trophic level in an ecosystem


(Greek word ‘ trophic’ = to food or feeding)



A trophic level refers to the position of an
organism in the food chain. The number of
trophic levels is equal to the number of steps
in the food chain. The green plants (producers)
occupying the first trophic level (T 1 ) are
called **producers**. The energy produced by
the producers is utilized by the plant eaters
(herbivores) they are called primary consumers
and occupy the second trophic level (T2)



![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/3.9.png )


Herbivores are eaten by carnivores, which occupy
the third trophic level (T 3). They are also called
**secondary consumers or primary carnivores**.
Carnivores are eaten by the other carnivores,
which occupy the fourth trophic level (T4 ). They
are called the **tertiary consumers or secondary**
**carnivores**. Some organisms which eat both
plants and animals are called as **omnivores**
(Crow). Such organisms may occupy more than
one trophic level in the food chain.




##### 7.2.4 Energy flow



The transfer of energy in an ecosystem between
trophic levels can be termed as energy flow. It
is the key function in an ecosystem. Part of the
energy obtained from the sun by producers is
transferred to consumers and decomposers
through each trophic level, while some
amount of energy is dissipated in the form of
heat. Energy flow is always unidirectional in
an ecosystem.


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/4.9.png )




##### Laws of thermodynamics


The storage and loss of energy in an ecosystem
is based on two basic laws of thermo-dynamics.




**i. First law of** **thermodynamics**



It states that energy can be transmitted from
one system to another in various forms. Energy
cannot be destroyed or created. But it can be
transformed from one form to another. As
a result, the quantity of energy present in the
universe is constant.



**Example:**



In photosynthesis, the product of starch
(chemical energy) is formed by the combination
of reactants (chlorophyll, H 2 O, CO 2). The
energy stored in starch is acquired from the
external sources (light energy) and so there is
no gain or loss in total energy. Here light energy
is converted into chemical energy.



![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/9.9.png )



**ii. Second law of thermodynamics**


It states that energy transformation results in the
reduction of the free energy of the system. Usually
energy transformation cannot be 100% efficient.
As energy is transferred from one organism to
another in the form of food, a portion of it is stored
as energy in living tissue, whereas a large part of
energy is dissipated as heat through respiration.
The transfer of energy is irreversible natural
process. Example: Ten percent law



**Ten percent law**



This law was proposed by Lindeman (1942). It
states that during transfer of food energy from
one trophic level to other, only about 10% stored
at every level and rest of them (90%) is lost in
respiration, decomposition and in the form of
heat. Hence, the law is called **ten percent law**.



**Example**: It is shown that of the 1000 Joules of
Solar energy trapped by producers. 100 Joules
of energy is stored as chemical energy through
photosynthesis. The remaining 900 Joules would
be lost in the environment. In the next trophic
level herbivores, which feed on producers get
only 10 Joules of energy and the remaining
90 Joules is lost in the environment. Likewise,
in the next trophic level, carnivores, which eat
herbivores store only 1 Joule of energy and
the remaining 9 Joules is dissipated. Finally,
the carnivores are eaten by tertiary consumers
which store only 0.1 Joule of energy and the
remaining 0.9 Joule is lost in the environment.
Thus, at the successive trophic level, only ten
percent energy is stored


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/5.9.png )




##### 7.2.5 Food chain



The movement of energy from producers upto
top carnivores is known as **food chain**, i.e., in
any food chain, energy flows from producers
to primary consumers, then from primary
consumers to secondary consumers, and finally
secondary consumers to tertiary consumers.
Hence, it shows linear network links. Generally,
there are two types of food chain, (1) Grazing
food chain and (2) Detritus food chain.



**1. Grazing food chain**


Main source of energy for the grazing food
chain is the **Sun**. It begins with the first link,
producers (plants). The second link in the food
chain is primary consumers (mouse) which
get their food from producers. The third link
in the food chain is secondary consumers
(snake) which get their food from primary
consumers. Fourth link in the food chain is tertiary consumers (eagle) which get their
food from secondary consumers.


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/6.9.png )


**2. Detritus food chain:**



This type of food chain begins with **dead organic**
**matter** which is an important source of energy.
A large amount of organic matter is derived from
the dead plants, animals and their excreta. This
type of food chain is present in all ecosystems.




The transfer of energy from the dead organic
matter, is transferred through a series of organisms
called detritus consumers (detritivores)- small
carnivores - large (top) carnivores with repeated
eating and being eaten respectively. This is called
the detritus food chain.


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/7.9.png )



##### 7.2.6 Food Web



![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/8.9.png )



The inter-locking pattern of a number of food
chain form a web like arrangement called food **web**. It is the basic unit of an ecosystem, to
maintain its stability in nature. Which is also
called homeostasis.



Example: In a grazing food chain of a grass
land, in the absence of a rabbit, a mouse may
also eat food grains. The mouse in turn may be
eaten directly by a hawk or by a snake and the
snake may be directly eaten by hawks.



Hence, this interlocking pattern of food chains
is the food web and the species of an ecosystem
may remain balanced to each other by some
sort of natural check.


**Significance of food web**



• Food web is constructed to describe species
interaction called direct interaction



• It can be used to illustrate indirect
interactions among different species



• It can be used to study bottom-up or top-
down control of community structure.



• It can be used to reveal different patterns
of energy transfer in terrestrial and aquatic
ecosystems.




##### 7.2.7 Ecological pyramids



Graphic representation of the trophic structure
and function at successive trophic levels of an
ecosystem is called **ecological** **pyramids**. The
concept of ecological pyramids was introduced
by **Charles** **Elton** (**1927**). Thus they are also
called as **Eltonian** **pyramid**



There are three types:

 (1) pyramid of number
(2) pyramid of biomass (3) pyramid of energy.



**1. Pyramid of number**


A graphical representation of the number of
organisms present at each successive trophic
level in an ecosystem is called **pyramids** **of**
**number**. There are three different shapes of
pyramids upright, spindle and inverted.



There is a gradual decrease in the number of
organisms in each trophic level from producers
to primary consumers and then to secondary
consumers, and finally to tertiary consumers.
Therefore, pyramids of number in **grassland**
and **pond** **ecosystem** are always **upright**.



In a **forest** **ecosystem** the pyramid of number
is somewhat different in shape, it is because the
base (T 1 ) of the pyramid occupies large sized
trees (Producer) which are lesser in number.
Herbivores (T2 ) (Fruit eating birds, elephant,
deer) occupying second trophic level, are more
in number than the producers. In final trophic
level (T 4 ), tertiary consumers (lion) are lesser in
number than the secondary consumer (T3) (fox
and snake). Therefore, the pyramid of number
in forest ecosystem looks **spindle** **shaped**.



The pyramid of number in a **parasite**
**ecosystem** is always **inverted**, because it
starts with a single tree. Therefore there is gradual increase in the number of organisms
in successive tropic levels from producer to
tertiary consumers.




![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/10.9.png )





**2 Pyramid of biomass**



A graphical representation of the amount of
organic material (biomass) present at each
successive trophic level in an ecosystem is called
**pyramid of biomass.**




In **grassland** and **forest ecosystems**, there
is a gradual decrease in biomass of organisms
at successive trophic levels from producers to
top carnivores (Tertiary consumer). Therefore,
these two ecosystems show pyramids as **upright**
pyramids of biomass.





However, in **pond ecosystem**, the bottom of
the pyramid is occupied by the producers, which
comprise very small organisms possessing
the least biomass and so, the value gradually
increases towards the tip of the pyramid.
Therefore, the pyramid of biomass is always
**inverted** in shape.





![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/11.9.png )



**3. Pyramid of energy**



A graphical representation of energy flow at
each successive trophic level in an ecosystem
is called **pyramid of energy**. The bottom of the
pyramid of energy is occupied by the producers.
There is a gradual decrease in energy transfer
at successive tropic levels from producers to the
upper levels. Therefore, the pyramid of energy is
**always upright**.


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/12.9.png )




##### 7.2.8 Decomposition:



Decomposition is a process in which the detritus
(dead plants, animals and their excreta) are
breaken down in to simple organic matter by the
decomposers. It is an essential process for recycling
and balancing the nutrient pool in an ecosystem.



##### Nature of decomposition



The process of decomposition varies based
on the nature of the organic compounds, i.e.,
some of the compounds like carbohydrate, fat
and protein are decomposed rapidly than the
cellulose, lignin, chitin, hair and bone.



##### Mechanism of decomposition



Decomposition is a step wise process of
degradation mediated by enzymatic reactions.
Detritus acts as a raw material for decomposition.
It occurs in the following steps.



![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/13.9.png )




**a. Fragmentation** -


 The breaking down
of detritus into smaller particles by
detritivores like bacteria, fungi and earth
worm is known as **fragmentation**. These
detritivores secrete certain substances
to enhance the fragmentation process
and increase the surface area of detritus
particles.


**b. Catabolism** - The decomposers produce
some extracellular enzymes in their
surroundings to break down complex
organic and inorganic compounds in to
simpler ones. This is called **catabolism**



**c. Leaching or Eluviation** - The movement
of decomposed, water soluble organic and
inorganic compounds from the surface to
the lower layer of soil or the carrying away
of the same by water is called **leaching** or
**eluviation**.



**d. Humification** - It is a process by which
simplified detritus is changed into dark
coloured amorphous substance called
**humus**. It is highly resistant to microbial
action, therefore decomposition is very
slow. It is the reservoir of nutrients.




**e. Mineralisation** - Some microbes are
involved in the release of inorganic
nutrients from the humus of the soil, such
process is called **mineralisation**.



##### Factors affecting decomposition





Decomposition is affected by climatic factors
like temperature, soil moisture, soil pH ,oxygen
and also the chemical quality of detritus.




###### 7.2.9 Biogeochemical cycles (Nutrient
cycles)



Exchange of nutrients between organisms and
their environment is one of the essential aspects
of an ecosystem. All organisms require nutrients
for their growth, development, maintenance
and reproduction. Circulation of nutrients
within the ecosystem or biosphere is known as
**biogeochemical** **cycles** and also called as ‘cycling
of materials.’ There are two basic types,




1. **Gaseous cycle** – It includes atmospheric
Oxygen, Carbon and Nitrogen cycles.



2. **Sedimentary cycle** – It includes the cycles
of Phosphorus, Sulphur and Calcium -
Which are present as sediments of earth.Many of the cycles mentioned above are studied
by you in previous classes. Therefore, in this
chapter, only the carbon and phosphorous
cycles are explained.




##### Carbon cycle



The circulation of carbon between organisms
and environment is known as the **carbon**
**cycle**. Carbon is an inevitable part of all
biomolecules and is substantially
impacted by the change in global
climate. Cycling of carbon between
organisms and atmosphere is a
consequence of two reciprocal
processes of photosynthesis and
respiration. The releasing of
carbon in the atmosphere increases
due to burning of fossile fuels,
deforestration, forest fire, volcanic
eruption and decomposition of
dead organic matters. The details of
carbon cycle are given in the figure.

![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/14.9.png )



##### Phosphorus cycle



It is a type of sedimentary cycle. Already
we know that phosphorus is found in the
biomolecules like DNA, RNA, ATP, NADP and
phospholipid molecules of living organisms.
Phosphorus is not abundant in the biosphere,
whereas a bulk quantity of phosphorus is present
in rock deposits, marine sediments and guano.



![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/15.9.png )


It is released from these deposits by weathering
process. After that, it circulates in lithosphere
as well as hydrosphere. The producers absorb
phosphorus in the form of phosphate ions,
and then it is transferred to each trophic level
of food chain through food. Again death of
the organisms and degradation by the action
of decomposers, the phosphorus is released
back into the lithosphere and hydrosphere to
maintain phosphorus cycle.



##### 7.2.10 Types of ecosystem



Biosphere consists of different types of
ecosystems, which are as follows

![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/17.9.png )


Though there are many types of ecosystems
as charted above. Only the pond ecosystem is
detailed below.



##### Structure of Pond ecosystem


It is a classical example for natural, aquatic,
freshwater, lentic type of ecosystem. It helps
us to understand the structure and function
of an ecosystem. When rain water gathers in a
shallow area, gradually over a period of time,
different kinds of organisms (microbes, plants,
animals) become part of this ecosystem. This
pond ecosystem is a self sustaining and self
regulatory fresh water ecosystem, which shows
a complex interaction between the abiotic and
biotic components in it.


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/18.9.png )


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/19.9.png )


**Abiotic components**


A pond ecosystem consists of dissolved
inorganic (CO2 , O2, Ca, N, Phosphate) and
organic substances (amino acids and humic
acid) formed from the dead organic matter. The
function of pond ecosystem is regulated by few
factors like the amount of light, temperature,
pH value of water and other climatic conditions.




**Biotic components**


They constitute the producers, variety of
consumers and decomposers (microorganisms).


**a. Producers**


A variety of phytoplanktons like *Oscillatoria*,
*Anabaena, Chlamydomonas, Pandorina*,
*Eudorina, Volvox and Diatoms*. Filamentous
algae such as *Ulothrix*, *Spirogyra*, *Cladophora*
and *Oedogonium*; floating plants *Azolla*,
*Salvia, Pistia*, *Wolffia and Eichhornia*; sub-
merged plants *Potamogeton and Phragmitis;*
rooted floating plants *Nymphaea* and *Nelumbo*;
macrophytes like *Typha* and *Ipomoea*, constitute
the major producers of a pond ecosystem.




**b. Consumers**



The animals represent the consumers of a
pond ecosystem which include zooplanktons
like Paramoecium and Daphnia (primary
consumers); benthos (bottom living animals)
like mollusces and annelids; secondary
consumers like water beetles and frogs; and
tertiary consumers (carnivores) like duck ,
crane and some top carnivores which include
large fish, hawk ,man, etc.


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/20.9.png )


##### c. Decomposers


They are also called as microconsumers.
They help to recycle the nutrients in the
ecosystem. These are present in mud water and
bottom of the ponds. Example: Bacteria and
Fungi. Decomposers perform the process of
decomposition in order to enrich the nutrients
in the pond ecosystem.



The cycling of nutrients between abiotic and
biotic components is evident in the pond
ecosystem, making itself self sufficient and self
regulating.

![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/21.9.png )


##### Stratification of pond ecosystem


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/22.9.png )


Based on the factors like distance from the
shore, penetration of light, depth of water,
types of plants and animals, there may be three
zones, littoral, limnetic and profundal. The
littoral zone, which is closest to the shore with
shallow water region, allows easy penetration of
light. It is warm and occupied by rooted plant
species. The limnetic zone refers the open water
of the pond with an effective penetration of
light and domination of planktons. The deeper
region of a pond below the limnetic zone is
called profundal zone with no effective light
penetration and predominance of heterotrophs.
The bottom zone of a pond is termed benthic
and is occupied by a community of organisms
called benthos (usually decomposers).The
primary productivity through photosynthesis of
littoral and limnetic zone is more due to greater
penetration of light than the profundal zone



##### 7.2.11 Ecosystem services ( Benefits)


Ecosystem services are defined as the benefits
that people derive from nature. Robert
Constanza et al (1927) stated “Ecosystem
services are the benefits provided to human,
through the transformation of resources (or
Environmental assets including land, water,
vegetation and atmosphere) into a flow of
essential goods and services”.



Study on ecosystem services acts as an
effective tool for gaining knowledge on
ecosystem benefits and their sustained use.
Without such knowledge gain, the fate of any
ecosystem will be at stake and the benefits they
provide to us in future will become bleak.


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/23.9.png )


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/24.9.png )




**How do anthropogenic activities affect**
**ecosystem services?**


Now, we all exploit the ecosystem more than
that of our needs. The **Millennium** **Ecosystem**
**Assessment** (**2005**) found that “over the past 50
years, humans have changed the ecosystem more
rapidly and extensively than in any comparable
period of time in human history, largely to meet
rapidly growing demands for food, fresh water,
medicine, timber, fiber and fuel.”





The varieties of benefits obtained from the ecosystem are generally categorized into the following four types


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/25.9.png )




Generally the following human activities
disturb or re-engineer an ecosystem every day.


• Habitat destruction


• Deforestation and over grazing


• Erosion of soils


• Introduction of non-native species


• Over harvesting of plant material



• Pollution of land, water and air



• Run off pesticides, fertilizers and animal
wastes



![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/26.9.png )


##### How to protect the ecosystem?


It is a practice of protecting ecosystem at
individual, organisational and governmental
levels for the benefits of both nature and humans.
Threats to ecosystems are many, like adverse
human activities, global warming, pollution, etc.
Hence, if we change our everyday life style, we
can help to protect the planet and its ecosystem.



**“If we fail to protect environment, we will fail to save posterity”**.


Therefore, we have to practice the following
in our day today life:


• Buy and use only ecofriendly products and
recycle them.


• Grow more trees


• Choose sustained farm products
(vegetables, fruits, greens, etc.)


• Reduce the use of natural resources.

• Recycle the waste and reduce the amount
of waste you produce.



• Reduce consumption of water and
electricity.


• Reduce or eliminate the use of house-hold
chemicals and pesticides.



• Maintain your cars and vehicles properly.
(In order to reduce carbon emission)


• Create awareness and educate about
ecosystem protection among your friends
and family members.


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/27.9.png )


##### 7.2.12 Ecosystem Management


It is a process that integrates ecological, socio
economic and institutional factors into a
comprehensive strategy in order to sustain
and enhance the quality of the ecosystem to
meet current and future needs.


Ecosystem management emphasis on
human role in judicious use of ecosystem and for sustained benefits through minimal
human impacts on ecosystems. Environmental
degradation and biodiversity loss will result
in depletion of natural resources, ultimately
affecting the existence of human.


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/28.9.png )




**Strategy of ecosystem management**


• It is used to maintain
biodiversity of ecosystems.


• It helps in indicating
the damaged ecosystem
(Some species indicate the
health of the ecosystem:
such species are called a
flagship species).



• It is used to recognize the inevitability of
ecosystem change and plan accordingly.


• It is one of the tools used for achieving
sustainability of ecosystem through
sustainable development programme (or
projects).



• It is also helpful in identifying ecosystems
which are in need of rehabilitation.



• It involves collaborative management with
government agencies, local population,
communities and NGO’s.



• It is used to build the capacity of local
institutions and community groups to assume
responsibility for long term implementation
of ecosystem management activities even
after the completion of the project.

##### 7.3 Plant Succession




We very often see that forests and lands in our
areas are drastically affected by natural calamities
(Flood, earthquake) and anthropogenic
activities (Fire, over grazing, cutting of trees).
Due to these reasons all plants of an area are
destroyed and the areas become nude. When we
observe this area, over a period of a time we can see that it will be gradually covered by
plant community again and become
fertile. Such successive replacement
of one type of plant community by
the other of the same area/ place is
known as plant **succession**. The first
invaded plants in a barren area are
called **pioneers**. On the other hand,
a series of transitional developments
of plant communities one after
another in a given area are called **seral**
**communities**. At the end a final stage and a
final plant community gets established which
are called as climax and climax community
respectively.






##### 7.3.1 Characteristics of ecological succession


• It is a systematic process which causes changes
in specific structure of plant community.


• It is resultant of changes of abiotic and
biotic factors.


• It transforms unstable community into a
stable community.


• Gradual progression in species diversity,
total biomass, niche specialisation, and
humus content of soil takes place.


• It progresses from simple food chain to
complex food web.


• It modifies the lower and simple life form
to the higher life forms.


• It creates inter-dependence of plants and
animals.


##### 7.3.2 Types of succession


The various types of succession have been
classified in different ways on the basis of
different aspects. These are as follows:



**1. Primary succession** - The development
of plant community in a barren area where no
community existed before is called primary
succession. The plants which colonize first in a barren area is called **pioneer** **species** or
**primary community** or **primary colonies**.
Generally, Primary succession takes a very
long time for the occurrence in any region.


**Example**: Microbes, Lichen, Mosses.



2. **Secondary succession**- The development of
a plant community in an area where an already
developed community has been destroyed by
some natural disturbance (Fire, flood, human
activity) is known as **secondary** **succession**.
Generally, This succession takes less time than
the time taken for primary succession.

**Example**: The forest destroyed by fire and
excessive lumbering may be re-occupied by
herbs over a period of times.


**3. Allogenic succession**


Allogeneic succession occurs as a result of abiotic factors. The replacement of existing
community is caused by other external factors
(soil erosion, leaching, etc.,) and not by existing
organisms.


Example: In a forest ecosystem soil erosion
and leaching alter the nutrient value of the soil
leading to the change of vegetation in that area.
