Have you seen lakes, ponds and pools in your
surroundings? They are all called water bodies
with many components in them. Can you list
out the things which are found in water bodies?
Mud, nutrients, clay, dissolved gases, planktons,
microorganisms, plants like algae, *Hydrilla*,
**Nelumbo*, *Nymphaea* and animals like snake,
small fish, large fish, frog, tortoise and crane
are the components of the water bodies which
constitutes **ecosystem**. Further, we all know
that plants and animals are prominent living
components in the environment. They interact
with space components such as air, water, soil,
sunlight, etc. For example, you have studied in
class XI, one of the life processes, photosynthesis
which utilizes sunlight , water, carbondioxide,
nutrients from the soil and release oxygen to
the atmosphere. From this, we understand that
the exchange of materials takes place between
living and space components. Likewise, you
can study the structure, function and types of
ecosystem in this chapter. The term **‘ecosystem’**
was proposed by A.G. Tansley (1935), who
defined it as ‘**the system resulting from **the**
**integration of all the living and nonliving**
**factors** of the environment**’. Whereas, Odum
(1962) defined ecosystem ‘**as the structural and functional unit of ecology**’.

#### 7.1  Structure of ecosystem



Ecosystem comprises of two major components.
They are:



i)**Abiotic (non-living) components**: It
includes climatic factors (air, water,
sunlight, rainfall, temperature and
humidity), edaphic factors (soil air,
soil water and pH of soil),topography
(latitude, altitude), organic components
(carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and humic
substances) and inorganic substances (C,
H, O, N and P ). Abiotic components play
vital role in any ecosystem and hence the
total inorganic substances present in any
ecosystem at a given time is called **standing**
**quality** (or) **standing** **state**.



ii)	**Biotic (living) components**: It includes
all living organisms like plants, animals,
fungi and bacteria. They form the trophic
structures of any ecosystem. On the basis
of nutritional relationships, trophic levels
of an ecosystem have two components.
(1) autotrophic components and (2)
heterotrophic components.




(1) **Autotrophic components**: Autotrophs
are organisms which can manufacture the
organic compounds from simple inorganic
components through a process called photosynthesis. In most of the ecosystems,
green plants are the autotrophs and are also
called **producers**.




(2) **Heterotrophic components**: Those
organisms which consume the producers are
called **consumers** and can be recognized into
macro and micro consumers. **Macroconsumers**
refer to herbivores, carnivores and omnivores
(primary, secondary and tertiary consumers).
**Microconsumers** are called decomposers.
Decomposers are organisms that decompose
the dead plants and animals to release organic
and inorganic nutrients into the environment
which are again reused by plants. Example:
Bacteria, Actinomycetes and Fungi.


The amount of living materials present
in a population at any given time is known
as **standing** **crop**, which may be expressed
in terms of number or biomass per unit area.
**Biomass** can be measured as fresh weight or
dry weight or carbon weight of organisms.
Biotic components are essential to construct the
food chain, food web and ecological pyramids.



#### 7.2 Functions of ecosystem


The function of ecosystem include creation of
energy creation, sharing of energy and cycling
of materials between the living and nonliving
components of an ecosystem.



Before studying the productivity in any
ecosystem, we should understand the essential
role of sunlight used by producers of the first
trophic level. The quantity of sunlight is directly
proportional to the production of energy by plants.


#### 7.2.1 Photosynthetically Radiation (PAR) Active



The amount of light available for photosynthesis
of plants is called **P**hotosynthetically **A**ctive
**R**adiation (PAR) which is from of 400-700 nm
in wave length. It is essential for photosynthesis
and plant growth. PAR is not always constant
because of clouds, tree shades, air, dust particles,
seasons, latitudes and length of the daylight
availability. Generally plants absorb more blue
and red light for efficient photosynthesis.




Of the total sunlight, 34 percent that reaches
the atmosphere is reflected back into the
atmosphere, moreover 10% is held by ozone,
water vapours and atmospheric gases and the
remaining 56% reaches the earth’s surface. Out
of this 56%, only 2 – 10% of the solar energy is
used by green plants for photosynthesis while
the remaining portion is dissipated as heat.




PAR is generally expressed in millimoles /
square meter / second by using silicon photo
voltic detectors which detect only 400 – 700
nm wavelength of light. PAR values range from
0 to 3000 millimoles /square meter / second.



At night PAR is zero and during midday in
the summer, PAR often reaches 2000 – 3000
millimoles /square meter/second.

#### 7.2.2 Productivity of an ecosystem



The rate of biomass production per unit area
in a unit time is called productivity. It can be
expressed in terms of gm /m 2 /year or Kcal/m 2 /
year. It is classified as given bellow.


1. Primary productivity



2. Secondary productivity



3. Community productivity



1. **Primary productivity**:


The chemical energy or organic matter
generated by autotrophs during the process
of photosynthesis and chemosynthesis is
called **primary** **productivity**. It is the source
of energy for all organisms, from bacteria to
human.



**a. Gross Primary Productivity (GPP)**



The total amount of food energy or organic
matter or biomass produced in an ecosystem by
autotrophs through the process of photosynthesis.
is called **gross** **primary** **productivity**



**b. Net Primary Productivity (NPP)**
The proportion of energy which remains
after respiration loss in the plant is called **net primary productivity**. It is also called as
apparent photosynthesis. Thus the difference
between GPP and respiration is known as NPP.



NPP = GPP – Respiration



NPP of whole biosphere is estimated to be
about 170 billion tons (dry weight) per year.
Out of which NPP of oceanic producers is
only 55 billion tons per year in unit time.


##### 2. Secondary productivity



The amount of energy stored in the tissues of
heterotrophs or consumers is called **secondary**
**productivity**.



**a. Gross secondary productivity**



It is equivalent to the total amount of plant
material is ingested by the herbivores minus
the materials lost as faeces.




**b. Net secondary productivity**


Storage of energy or biomass by consumers
per unit area per unit time, after respiratory
loss is called **net secondary productivity**.



##### 3. Community productivity


The rate of net synthesis of organic matter
(biomass) by a group of plants per unit
area per unit time is known as **community**
**productivity**.


**Factors affecting primary productivity**


Primary productivity depends upon the
plant species of an area, their photosynthetic
capacity, availability of nutrients, solar
radiation, precipitation, soil type, topographic
factors (altitude, latitude, direction), and other
environmental factors. It varies in different
types of ecosystems.



#### 7.2.3 Concept of trophic level in an ecosystem


(Greek word ‘ trophic’ = to food or feeding)



A trophic level refers to the position of an
organism in the food chain. The number of
trophic levels is equal to the number of steps
in the food chain. The green plants (producers)
occupying the first trophic level (T 1 ) are
called **producers**. The energy produced by
the producers is utilized by the plant eaters
(herbivores) they are called primary consumers
and occupy the second trophic level (T2)



![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/3.9.png )


Herbivores are eaten by carnivores, which occupy
the third trophic level (T 3). They are also called
**secondary consumers or primary carnivores**.
Carnivores are eaten by the other carnivores,
which occupy the fourth trophic level (T4 ). They
are called the **tertiary consumers or secondary**
**carnivores**. Some organisms which eat both
plants and animals are called as **omnivores**
(Crow). Such organisms may occupy more than
one trophic level in the food chain.




##### 7.2.4 Energy flow



The transfer of energy in an ecosystem between
trophic levels can be termed as energy flow. It
is the key function in an ecosystem. Part of the
energy obtained from the sun by producers is
transferred to consumers and decomposers
through each trophic level, while some
amount of energy is dissipated in the form of
heat. Energy flow is always unidirectional in
an ecosystem.


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/4.9.png )




##### Laws of thermodynamics


The storage and loss of energy in an ecosystem
is based on two basic laws of thermo-dynamics.




**i. First law of** **thermodynamics**



It states that energy can be transmitted from
one system to another in various forms. Energy
cannot be destroyed or created. But it can be
transformed from one form to another. As
a result, the quantity of energy present in the
universe is constant.



**Example:**



In photosynthesis, the product of starch
(chemical energy) is formed by the combination
of reactants (chlorophyll, H 2 O, CO 2). The
energy stored in starch is acquired from the
external sources (light energy) and so there is
no gain or loss in total energy. Here light energy
is converted into chemical energy.



![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/9.9.png )



**ii. Second law of thermodynamics**


It states that energy transformation results in the
reduction of the free energy of the system. Usually
energy transformation cannot be 100% efficient.
As energy is transferred from one organism to
another in the form of food, a portion of it is stored
as energy in living tissue, whereas a large part of
energy is dissipated as heat through respiration.
The transfer of energy is irreversible natural
process. Example: Ten percent law



**Ten percent law**



This law was proposed by Lindeman (1942). It
states that during transfer of food energy from
one trophic level to other, only about 10% stored
at every level and rest of them (90%) is lost in
respiration, decomposition and in the form of
heat. Hence, the law is called **ten percent law**.



**Example**: It is shown that of the 1000 Joules of
Solar energy trapped by producers. 100 Joules
of energy is stored as chemical energy through
photosynthesis. The remaining 900 Joules would
be lost in the environment. In the next trophic
level herbivores, which feed on producers get
only 10 Joules of energy and the remaining
90 Joules is lost in the environment. Likewise,
in the next trophic level, carnivores, which eat
herbivores store only 1 Joule of energy and
the remaining 9 Joules is dissipated. Finally,
the carnivores are eaten by tertiary consumers
which store only 0.1 Joule of energy and the
remaining 0.9 Joule is lost in the environment.
Thus, at the successive trophic level, only ten
percent energy is stored


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/5.9.png )




##### 7.2.5 Food chain



The movement of energy from producers upto
top carnivores is known as **food chain**, i.e., in
any food chain, energy flows from producers
to primary consumers, then from primary
consumers to secondary consumers, and finally
secondary consumers to tertiary consumers.
Hence, it shows linear network links. Generally,
there are two types of food chain, (1) Grazing
food chain and (2) Detritus food chain.



**1. Grazing food chain**


Main source of energy for the grazing food
chain is the **Sun**. It begins with the first link,
producers (plants). The second link in the food
chain is primary consumers (mouse) which
get their food from producers. The third link
in the food chain is secondary consumers
(snake) which get their food from primary
consumers. Fourth link in the food chain is tertiary consumers (eagle) which get their
food from secondary consumers.


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/6.9.png )


**2. Detritus food chain:**



This type of food chain begins with **dead organic**
**matter** which is an important source of energy.
A large amount of organic matter is derived from
the dead plants, animals and their excreta. This
type of food chain is present in all ecosystems.




The transfer of energy from the dead organic
matter, is transferred through a series of organisms
called detritus consumers (detritivores)- small
carnivores - large (top) carnivores with repeated
eating and being eaten respectively. This is called
the detritus food chain.


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/7.9.png )



##### 7.2.6 Food Web



![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/8.9.png )



The inter-locking pattern of a number of food
chain form a web like arrangement called food **web**. It is the basic unit of an ecosystem, to
maintain its stability in nature. Which is also
called homeostasis.



Example: In a grazing food chain of a grass
land, in the absence of a rabbit, a mouse may
also eat food grains. The mouse in turn may be
eaten directly by a hawk or by a snake and the
snake may be directly eaten by hawks.



Hence, this interlocking pattern of food chains
is the food web and the species of an ecosystem
may remain balanced to each other by some
sort of natural check.


**Significance of food web**



• Food web is constructed to describe species
interaction called direct interaction



• It can be used to illustrate indirect
interactions among different species



• It can be used to study bottom-up or top-
down control of community structure.



• It can be used to reveal different patterns
of energy transfer in terrestrial and aquatic
ecosystems.




##### 7.2.7 Ecological pyramids



Graphic representation of the trophic structure
and function at successive trophic levels of an
ecosystem is called **ecological** **pyramids**. The
concept of ecological pyramids was introduced
by **Charles** **Elton** (**1927**). Thus they are also
called as **Eltonian** **pyramid**



There are three types:

 (1) pyramid of number
(2) pyramid of biomass (3) pyramid of energy.



**1. Pyramid of number**


A graphical representation of the number of
organisms present at each successive trophic
level in an ecosystem is called **pyramids** **of**
**number**. There are three different shapes of
pyramids upright, spindle and inverted.



There is a gradual decrease in the number of
organisms in each trophic level from producers
to primary consumers and then to secondary
consumers, and finally to tertiary consumers.
Therefore, pyramids of number in **grassland**
and **pond** **ecosystem** are always **upright**.



In a **forest** **ecosystem** the pyramid of number
is somewhat different in shape, it is because the
base (T 1 ) of the pyramid occupies large sized
trees (Producer) which are lesser in number.
Herbivores (T2 ) (Fruit eating birds, elephant,
deer) occupying second trophic level, are more
in number than the producers. In final trophic
level (T 4 ), tertiary consumers (lion) are lesser in
number than the secondary consumer (T3) (fox
and snake). Therefore, the pyramid of number
in forest ecosystem looks **spindle** **shaped**.



The pyramid of number in a **parasite**
**ecosystem** is always **inverted**, because it
starts with a single tree. Therefore there is gradual increase in the number of organisms
in successive tropic levels from producer to
tertiary consumers.




![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/10.9.png )





**2 Pyramid of biomass**



A graphical representation of the amount of
organic material (biomass) present at each
successive trophic level in an ecosystem is called
**pyramid of biomass.**




In **grassland** and **forest ecosystems**, there
is a gradual decrease in biomass of organisms
at successive trophic levels from producers to
top carnivores (Tertiary consumer). Therefore,
these two ecosystems show pyramids as **upright**
pyramids of biomass.





However, in **pond ecosystem**, the bottom of
the pyramid is occupied by the producers, which
comprise very small organisms possessing
the least biomass and so, the value gradually
increases towards the tip of the pyramid.
Therefore, the pyramid of biomass is always
**inverted** in shape.





![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/11.9.png )



**3. Pyramid of energy**



A graphical representation of energy flow at
each successive trophic level in an ecosystem
is called **pyramid of energy**. The bottom of the
pyramid of energy is occupied by the producers.
There is a gradual decrease in energy transfer
at successive tropic levels from producers to the
upper levels. Therefore, the pyramid of energy is
**always upright**.


![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/12.9.png )




##### 7.2.8 Decomposition:



Decomposition is a process in which the detritus
(dead plants, animals and their excreta) are
breaken down in to simple organic matter by the
decomposers. It is an essential process for recycling
and balancing the nutrient pool in an ecosystem.



##### Nature of decomposition



The process of decomposition varies based
on the nature of the organic compounds, i.e.,
some of the compounds like carbohydrate, fat
and protein are decomposed rapidly than the
cellulose, lignin, chitin, hair and bone.



##### Mechanism of decomposition



Decomposition is a step wise process of
degradation mediated by enzymatic reactions.
Detritus acts as a raw material for decomposition.
It occurs in the following steps.



![lesson 9](/books/12-biology/bio-botany/images/13.9.png )
