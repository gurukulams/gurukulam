Have you seen lakes, ponds and pools in your
surroundings? They are all called water bodies
with many components in them. Can you list
out the things which are found in water bodies?
Mud, nutrients, clay, dissolved gases, planktons,
microorganisms, plants like algae, *Hydrilla*,
**Nelumbo*, *Nymphaea* and animals like snake,
small fish, large fish, frog, tortoise and crane
are the components of the water bodies which
constitutes **ecosystem**. Further, we all know
that plants and animals are prominent living
components in the environment. They interact
with space components such as air, water, soil,
sunlight, etc. For example, you have studied in
class XI, one of the life processes, photosynthesis
which utilizes sunlight , water, carbondioxide,
nutrients from the soil and release oxygen to
the atmosphere. From this, we understand that
the exchange of materials takes place between
living and space components. Likewise, you
can study the structure, function and types of
ecosystem in this chapter. The term **‘ecosystem’**
was proposed by A.G. Tansley (1935), who
defined it as ‘**the system resulting from **the**
**integration of all the living and nonliving**
**factors** of the environment**’. Whereas, Odum
(1962) defined ecosystem ‘**as the structural and functional unit of ecology**’.

#### 7.1  Structure of ecosystem



Ecosystem comprises of two major components.
They are:



i)**Abiotic (non-living) components**: It
includes climatic factors (air, water,
sunlight, rainfall, temperature and
humidity), edaphic factors (soil air,
soil water and pH of soil),topography
(latitude, altitude), organic components
(carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and humic
substances) and inorganic substances (C,
H, O, N and P ). Abiotic components play
vital role in any ecosystem and hence the
total inorganic substances present in any
ecosystem at a given time is called **standing**
**quality** (or) **standing** **state**.



ii)	**Biotic (living) components**: It includes
all living organisms like plants, animals,
fungi and bacteria. They form the trophic
structures of any ecosystem. On the basis
of nutritional relationships, trophic levels
of an ecosystem have two components.
(1) autotrophic components and (2)
heterotrophic components.




(1) **Autotrophic components**: Autotrophs
are organisms which can manufacture the
organic compounds from simple inorganic
components through a process called photosynthesis. In most of the ecosystems,
green plants are the autotrophs and are also
called **producers**.




(2) **Heterotrophic components**: Those
organisms which consume the producers are
called **consumers** and can be recognized into
macro and micro consumers. **Macroconsumers**
refer to herbivores, carnivores and omnivores
(primary, secondary and tertiary consumers).
**Microconsumers** are called decomposers.
Decomposers are organisms that decompose
the dead plants and animals to release organic
and inorganic nutrients into the environment
which are again reused by plants. Example:
Bacteria, Actinomycetes and Fungi.


The amount of living materials present
in a population at any given time is known
as **standing** **crop**, which may be expressed
in terms of number or biomass per unit area.
**Biomass** can be measured as fresh weight or
dry weight or carbon weight of organisms.
Biotic components are essential to construct the
food chain, food web and ecological pyramids.



#### 7.2 Functions of ecosystem


The function of ecosystem include creation of
energy creation, sharing of energy and cycling
of materials between the living and nonliving
components of an ecosystem.



Before studying the productivity in any
ecosystem, we should understand the essential
role of sunlight used by producers of the first
trophic level. The quantity of sunlight is directly
proportional to the production of energy by plants.


#### 7.2.1 Photosynthetically Radiation (PAR) Active



The amount of light available for photosynthesis
of plants is called **P**hotosynthetically **A**ctive
**R**adiation (PAR) which is from of 400-700 nm
in wave length. It is essential for photosynthesis
and plant growth. PAR is not always constant
because of clouds, tree shades, air, dust particles,
seasons, latitudes and length of the daylight
availability. Generally plants absorb more blue
and red light for efficient photosynthesis.




Of the total sunlight, 34 percent that reaches
the atmosphere is reflected back into the
atmosphere, moreover 10% is held by ozone,
water vapours and atmospheric gases and the
remaining 56% reaches the earth’s surface. Out
of this 56%, only 2 – 10% of the solar energy is
used by green plants for photosynthesis while
the remaining portion is dissipated as heat.




PAR is generally expressed in millimoles /
square meter / second by using silicon photo
voltic detectors which detect only 400 – 700
nm wavelength of light. PAR values range from
0 to 3000 millimoles /square meter / second.



At night PAR is zero and during midday in
the summer, PAR often reaches 2000 – 3000
millimoles /square meter/second.
