Ecology is a division of biology which deals
with the study of environment in relation to
organisms. It can be studied by considering
individual organisms, population, community,
biome or biosphere and their environment.
While observing our different environments,
one can ask questions like 

* Why do plants or animals vary with places?

* What are the causes for variation in
biological diversity of different places?


* How soil, climate and other physical features
affect the flora and fauna or vice versa?

These questions can be better answered with
the study of ecology.

Ecology is essentially a practical science
involving experiments, continuous
observations to predict how organisms react
to particular environmental circumstances
and understanding the principles involved in
ecology.

### <u> 6.1 Ecology </u>

The term “ecology”
**(oekologie)** is derived from
two Greek words – **oikos**
(meaning house or dwelling
place and **logos** meaning
study) It was first proposed by
Reiter (1868). However, the
most widely accepted definition of ecology was
given by **Ernest Haeckel** (1869). 

![Unit 9 ](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic1.png )


**Alexander von Humbolt** - Father of Ecology

**Eugene P. Odum** - Father of modern Ecology

**R. Misra** - Father of Indian Ecology


#### <u> 6.1.1 Definitions of ecology </u>

“The study of living organisms, both plants and
animals, in their natural habitats or homes.”

**- Reiter (1885)**

“Ecology is the study of the reciprocal
relationship between living organisms and their
environment.” **- Earnest Haeckel (1889)**


#### <u> 6.1.2 Ecological hierarchy </u>

The interaction of organisms with their
environment results in the establishment of
grouping of organisms which is called ecological
hierarchy or ecological levels of organization.
The basic unit of ecological hierarchy is an
individual organism. The hierarchy of ecological
systems is illustrated below:


![Unit 9 - flowchart 1](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic2.png )

#### <u> 6.1.3 Branches of Ecology: </u>

Ecology is mainly divided into two branches,
they are autecology and synecology

1. Autecology is the ecology of an individual
species and is also called species ecology.

2. Synecology is the ecology of a population or
community with one or more species and also
called as community ecology.

Many advances and developments in the field
ecology resulted in various new dimensions
and branches. Some of the advanced fields are
Molecular ecology, Eco technology, Statistical
ecology and Environmental toxicology

#### <u> 6.1.4 Habitat and Niche </u>

**Habitat**

Habitat is a specific physical place or locality
occupied by an organism or any species which
has a particular combination of abiotic or
environmental factors. But the environment of
any community is called **Biotope.**

**Niche**

An ecological niche refers to an organism’s place
in the biotic environment and its functional
role in an ecosystem. The term was coined by
the naturalist **Roswell Hill Johnson but Grinell**
(1917) was probably first to use this term. The 
habitat and niche of any organism is called
**Ecotope**

**The differences between habitat and niche are as follows.**

**<u>Applied ecology or environmental technology :</u>**

Application of the
Science of ecology is
otherwise called as **Applied ecology** or
**Environmental technology.** It helps us to
manage and conserve natural resources,
particularly ecosystems, forest and wild
life conservative and management.
Environmental management involves
Bio-diversity conservation, Ecosystem
restoration, Habitat management,
Invasive species management, Protected
areas management and also help us plan
landscapes and environmental impact
designing for the futuristic ecology.

{{< /box >}}

#### <u> 6.1.5 Ecological equivalents </u>

Taxonomically different species occupying
similar habitats (Niches) in different geographical
regions are called **Ecological equivalents.**

**Examples:**

* Certain species of epiphytic orchids of
Western Ghats of India differ from the
epiphytic orchids of South America. But
they are epiphytes.

* Species of the grass lands of Western Ghats
of India differ from the grass species of
temperate grass lands of Steppe in North
America. But they are all ecologically
primary producers and fulfilling similar
roles in their respective communities.

![Figure 6.1: Environmental factors affecting a plant](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic3.png )

#### <u> 6.2 Ecological factors </u>

Many organisms, co-exist in an environment.
The environment (surrounding) includes
physical, chemical and biological components.
When a component surrounding an organism
affects the life of an organism, it becomes a
factor. All such factors together are called
environmental factors or ecological factors.
These factors can be classified into living
(biotic) and non-living (abiotic) which make
the environment of an organism. However the
ecological factors are meaningfully grouped
into four classes, which are as follows:

i. Climatic factors

ii. Edaphic factors

iii. Topographic factors

iv. Biotic factors

We will discuss the above factors in a concise
manner.

{{< box title="Learning Objectives" type="objective" >}}

###### DO YOU KNOW? 


Flowers of poppy, chicory,
dog rose and many other
plants, blossom before the
break of dawn (4 – 5 am),
evening primrose open up with the onset
of dusk (5 – 6 pm) due to diurnal rhythm.

{{< /box >}}

#### <u> 6.2.1 Climatic Factors </u>

Climate is one of the important natural factors
controlling the plant life. The climatic factors
includes light, temperature, water, wind and
fire.

**a. Light**

Light is a well known factor needed for the
basic physiological processes of plants, such as
photosynthesis, transpiration, seed germination
and flowering. The portion of the sunlight which
can be resolved by the human eye is called
**visible light.** The visible part of light is madeup of wavelength from about 400 nm (violet)
to 700 nm **(red)**. The rate of photosynthesis is
maximum at **blue** (400 – 500 nm) and red (600 –
700 nm). The **green**(500 – 600 nm) wave length
of spectrum is less strongly absorbed by plants.

**Effects of light on plants**


![Figure 6.2: Various effects of light upon a green plant](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic4.png )

Based on the tolerance to intensities of light,
the plants are divided into two types. They are 

1. Heliophytes - Light loving plants.
Example: Angiosperms.


2. Sciophytes - Shade loving plants.
Example: Bryophytes and Pteridophytes.

In deep sea (>500m), the environment is
dark and its inhabitants are not aware of the
existence of celestial source of energy called
Sun. What, then is their source of energy?


{{< box title="Learning Objectives" type="objective" >}}

###### DO YOU KNOW? 

Palaeoclimatology–Helps to
reconstruct past climates of
our planet and flora, fauna
and ecosystem in which they
lived. Example: Air bubbles trapped in ice
for tens of thousands of years with fossilized
pollen, coral, plant and animal debris.

{{< /box >}}


**b. Temperature**

Temperature is one of the important factors
which affect almost all the metabolic activities
of an organism. Every physiological process in
an organism requires an optimum temperature
at which it shows the maximum metabolic rate.
Three limits of temperature can be recognized
for any organism. They are

1.**Minimum temperature**- Physiological
activities are lowest.

2. **Optimum temperature**- Physiological
activities are maximum.

3. **Maximum temperature** - Physiological
activities will stop.

Based on the temperature prevailing in
an area, **Raunkiaer** classified the world’s
vegetation into the following four types. They
are megatherms, mesotherms, microtherms
and hekistotherms. In thermal springs and deep
sea hydrothermal vents the average temperature
exceed 100<sup>o</sup>C.

Based on the range of **thermal tolerance,**
organisms are divided into two types.

**1. Eurythermal:** Organisms which can tolerate
a wide range of temperature fluctuations.
Example: Zostera (A marine Angiosperm) and
Artemisia tridentata.


**2. Stenothermal:** Organisms which can
tolerate only small range of temperature
variations. Example: Mango and Palm
(Terrestrial Angiosperms).

Mango plant does not grow in temperate
countries like Canada and Germany

#### <u>Thermal Stratification </u>

It is usually found in aquatic habitat. The
change in the temperature profile with
increasing depth in a water body is called
**thermal stratification**. There are three levels
of thermal stratifications.

![Figure 6.3: Thermal stratification of pond](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic5.png )

1. Epilimnion – The upper layer of warmer
water.

2. Metalimnion – The middle layer with a
zone of gradual decrease in temperature.

3. Hypolimnion - The bottom layer of colder water.

**Temperature based zonation**

Variations in **latitude** and **altitude** do affect the
temperature and the vegetation on the earth
surface. The latitudinal and altitudinal zonation
of vegetation is illustrated below:

**Latitude:** Latitude is an angle which ranges
from 00 at the equator to 900 at the poles.


**Altitude:** How high a place is located above
the sea level is called the altitude of the place.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic6.png )


**Timber line / Tree line :** It is an imaginary
line in a mountain or higher areas of land
that marks the level above which trees do
not grow. The altitudinal limit of normal tree
growth is about **3000 to 4000m.**

**Effects of temperature**

The following physiological processes are
influenced by temperature:

* Temperature affects the enzymatic action
of all the bio-chemical reactions in a plant
body.

* It influences CO2 and O2 solubility in the
biological systems. Increases respiration
and stimulates growth of seedlings.

* Low temperature with high humidity can
cause spread of diseases in plants.

* The varying temperature with moisture
determines the distribution of the
vegetation types.

**c. Water**


Water is one of the most important climatic
factors. It affects the vital processes of all living
organisms. It is believed that even life had
originated only in water during the evolution of
Earth. Water covers more than 70% of the earth’s
surface. In nature, water is available to plants in
three ways. They are **atmospheric moisture,**
**precipitation and soil water.**

{{< box title="Learning Objectives" type="objective" >}}

###### DO YOU KNOW? 

**Evergreen forests** – Found
where heavy rainfall occurs
throughout the year.

**Sclerophyllous forests** –
Found where heavy rainfall occurs during
winter and low rainfall during summer.

{{< /box >}}

The productivity and distribution of plants depend
upon the availability of water. Further the quality
of water is also important especially for the aquatic
organisms. The total amount of water salinity in
different water bodies are :i).5% in inland water
(Fresh water) ii).30 – 35% in sea water and iii).
More than 100% in hypersaline water **(Lagoons)**
Based on the range of tolerance of salinity,
organisms are divided into two types.

**1. Euryhaline:** Organisms which can live in
water with wide range of salinity. Examples:
Marine algae and marina angiosperms


**2. Stenohaline:** Organisms which can withstand 
only small range of salinity. Example: Plants of
estuaries.

![Table 6.2: Tolerance of Environmental factor](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic7.png )


**Examples of tolerance to toxicity**

i. Soyabean and tomato manage to tolerate
presence of cadmium poisoning by isolating
cadmium and storing into few group of cells
and prevent cadmium affecting other cells .
ii. Rice and Eichhornia (water hyacinth ) tolerate
cadmium by binding it to their proteins.

These plants otherwise can also be used to
remove cadmium from contaminated soil ,this
is known as **Phytoremediation.**

**d. Wind**


Air in motion is called wind. It is also a
vital ecological factor. The atmospheric air
contains a number of gases, particles and
other constituents. The composition of gases
in atmosphere is as follows: Nitrogen -78% ,
Oxygen -21%, Carbon-di-oxide -0.03%, Argon
and other gases - 0.93%. The other components
of wind are water vapour, gaseous pollutants,
dust, smoke particles, microorganisms,
pollen grains, spores, etc. **Anemometer** is the
instrument used to measure the speed of wind.

{{< box title="Learning Objectives" type="objective" >}}

###### DO YOU KNOW? 

**Green House Effect Albedo Effect**

Gases let out to atmosphere
causes climatic change.
Emission of dust and aerosols (small solids
or liquid particles in suspension in the
atmosphere) from industries, automobiles,
forest fire, So2 and DMS (dimethyl sulphur)
play an important role in disturbing the
temperature level of any region. Aerosols
with small particles is reflecting the
solar radiation entering the atmosphere.
This is known as **Albedo effect.** So it
reduces the temperature (cooling) limits,
photosynthesis and respiration. The
sulphur compounds are responsible for
**acid rain** due to acidification of rain water
and destroy the ozone.

{{< /box >}}

**Effects of wind**

*  Wind is an important factor for the
formation of rain

*  Causes wave formation in lakes and ocean,
promotes aeration of water

*  Strong wind causes soil erosion and reduces
soil fertility

*  Increases the rate of transpiration

* Helps in pollination in anemophilous plants

* It also helps in dispersal of many
fruits, seeds, spores, etc.


* Strong wind may cause up-rooting of big trees


*  Unidirectional wind stimulates the
development of flag forms in trees.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic8.png )

**e. Fire**

Fire is an exothermic factor caused due to the
chemical process of combustion, releasing heat
and light. It is mostly man-made and sometimes develops naturally due to the friction
between the tree surfaces. Fire is generally
divided into

1. Ground fire – Which is flameless and
subterranean.

2. Surface fire – Which consumes the herbs
and shrubs.

3. Crown fire – Which burns the forest canopy.
Effects of fire

* Fire has a dir ect lethal effect on plants

*  Burning scars are the suitable places for the
entry of parasitic fungi and insects

*  It brings out the alteration of light, rainfall,
nutrient cycle, fertility of soil, pH, soil flora
and fauna

*  Some fungi which grow in soil of burnt areas
called pyrophilous.
*Example: Pyronema confluens*

**Indicators of fire** – *Pteris* ( fern ) and
*Pyronema*(fungus) indicates the burnt up
and fire disturbed areas. So they are called
indicators of fire.


**Fire break**– It is a gap made in the vegetation
that acts as a barrier to slow down or stop the
progress of fire.


**A natural fire break**may occur when there
is a lack of vegetation such as River, lake and
canyon found in between vegetation may act
as a natural fire break.


**Rhytidome:** It is the structural defense by
plants against fire .The outer bark of trees
which extends to the last formed periderm is
called Rhytidome. It is composed of multiple
layers of suberized periderm, cortical and
phloem tissues. It protects the stem against
fire , water loss, invasion of insects and
prevents infections by microorganisms.


#### <u> 6.2.2 Edaphic factors </u>

Edaphic factors, the abiotic factors related
to soil, include the physical and chemical
composition of the soil formed in a particular
area. The study of soils is called Pedology.

**The soil**

Soil is the weathered superficial layer of the
Earth in which plants can grow. It is a complex
composite mass consisting of soil constituents,
soil water, soil air and soil organisms, etc.

**Soil formation**


Soil originates from rocks and develops gradually
at different rates, depending upon the ecological
and climatic conditions. Soil formation is
initiated by the weathering process. Biological
weathering takes place when organisms like
bacteria, fungi, lichens and plants help in the
breakdown of rocks through the production of
acids and certain chemical substances. 

**Soil types**

Based on soil formation (pedogenesis),
the soils are divided into

**1. Residual soils** –These are soils formed by
weathering and pedogenesis of the rock.

**2. Transported soils** – These are transported
by various agencies.

The important edaphic factors which affect
vegetation are as follows:

**1. Soil moisture:** Plants absorbs rain water
and moisture directly from the air

**2. Soil water:** Soil water is more important
than any other ecological factors affecting the
distribution of plants. Rain is the main source
of soil water. Capillary water held between
pore spaces of soil particles and angles
between them is the most important form of
water available to the plants.

**3. Soil reactions:** Soil may be acidic or
alkaline or neutral in their reaction. pH value
of the soil solution determines the availability
of plant nutrients. The best pH range of the soil
for cultivation of crop plants is **5.5 to 6.8.**


**4. Soil nutrients:**Soil fertility and productivity
is the ability of soil to provide all essential
plant nutrients such as minerals and organic
nutrients in the form of ions.


**5. Soil temperature:** Soil temperature of an
area plays an important role in determining
the geographical distribution of plants. Low
temperature reduces use of water and solute
absorption by roots.


**6. Soil atmosphere:** The spaces left between
soil particles are called pore spaces which
contains oxygen and carbon-di-oxide.

**7. Soil organisms:** Many organisms existing
in the soil like bacteria, fungi, algae,
protozoans, nematodes,
insects, earthworms, etc. are
called soil organisms. 

![Figure 6.7: Soil Profile](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic9.png )

**Soil Profile**

Soil is commonly stratified into horizons at
different depth. These layers differ in their
physical, chemical and biological properties.
This succession of super-imposed horizons is
called soil profile.

**Types of soil particles**

Based on the relative proportion of soil particles,
four types of soil are recognized.

![Table 6.3: Types of soil particles](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic10.png )

**Loamy soil is ideal soil for cultivation.** It
consists of 70% sand and 30% clay or silt or both.
It ensures good retention and proper drainage
of water. The porosity of soil provides adequate
aeration and allows the penetration of roots.

Based on the water retention, aeration and
mineral contents of soil, the distribution of
vegetation is divided into following types.

**1. Halophytes:** Plants living in saline soils

**2. Psammophytes:** Plants living in sandy soils

**3. Lithophytes:** Plants living on rocky surface

**4. Chasmophytes:** Plants living in rocky crevices

**5. Cryptophytes:**Plants living below the soil surface

**6. Cryophytes:**Plants living on surface of ice

**7. Oxylophytes:** Plants living in acidic soil

**8. Calciphytes:** Plants living in calcium rich
alkaline soil.

**Holard** – Total soil water content

**Chresard**–Water available to plants

**Echard** – Water not available to plants

**6.2.3 Topographic factors**


The surface features of earth are called
**topography.** Topographic influence on the
climate of any area is determined by the
interaction of solar radiation, temperature,
humidity, rainfall, latitude and altitude. It affects
the vegetation through climatic variations in
small areas (micro climate ) and even changes
the soil conditions. Topographic factors include
latitude, altitude, direction of mountain,
steepness of mountain etc.

**a. Latitudes and altitudes**

Latitudes represent distance from the equator.
Temperature values are maximum at the equator
and decrease gradually towards poles. Different
types of vegetation occur from equator to poles
which are illustrated below.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic11.png )

Height above the sea level forms the
**altitude.**At high altitudes, the velocity of wind
remains high, temperature and air pressure
decrease while humidity and intensity of light
increases. Due to these factors, vegetation at
different altitudes varies, showing distinct
zonation.

**b. Direction of Mountain**

North and south faces of mountain or hill possess
different types of flora and fauna because they
differ in their humidity, rainfall, light intensity,
light duration and temperature regions.

**Ecotone -** The transition zone between two
ecosystems. Example: The border between
forest and grassland.

**Edge effect –** Spices found in ecotone areas
are unique due to the effect of the two
habitats. This is called edge effect. Example:
Owl in the ecotone area between forest and
grassland.

The two faces of the mountain or hill receive
different amount of solar radiation, wind action
and rain. Of these two faces, the windward region
possesses good vegetation due to heavy rains and
the leeward region possesses poor vegetation due
to rain shadows (rain deficit).

Similarly in the soil of aquatic bodies like
ponds the center and edge possess different
depth of water due to soil slope and different
wave actions in the water body. Therefore,
different parts of the same area may possess
different species of organisms.

**c. Steepness of the mountain**

The steepness of the mountain or hill allows
the rain to run off. As a result the loss of water
causes water deficit and quick erosion of the top
soil resulting in poor vegetation. On the other
hand, the plains and valley are rich in vegetation
due to the slow drain of surface water and better
retention of water in the soil.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic12.png )

#### <u> 6.2.4 Biotic factors  </u> 

The interactions among living organisms
such as plants and animals are called **biotic**
**factors**, which may cause marked effects upon
vegetation. The effects may be direct and indirect
and modifies the environment. The plants
mostly which lives together in a community
and influence one another. Similarly, animals in
association with plants also affect the plant life
in one or several ways. The different interactions
among them can be classified into following two
types they are positive interaction and negative
interaction

**Positive interactions**

When one or both the participating species are
benefited, it is positive interaction. Examples;
Mutualism and Commensalism.

**a. Mutualism:** It is an interaction between
two species of organisms in which both are
benefitted from the obligate association. The
following are common examples of mutualism.

**Nitrogen fixation**

**Rhizobium**(Bacterium) forms nodules in the
roots of leguminous plants and lives symbiotically.
The Rhizobium obtains food from leguminous
plant and in turn fixes atmospheric nitrogen into
nitrate, making it available to host plants.

![Table 6.4: Different interactions of plant](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic13.png )

**Other examples:**


* Water fern
(Azolla) and
Nitrogen fixing
Cyanobacterium
(Anabaena ).

* Anab a e n a
present in
c o r a l l o i d
roots of Cycas.
(Gymnosperm)

* Cyanobacterium (Nostoc) found in the
thalloid body of Anthoceros.(Bryophytes)

* Wasps present in fruits of fig.

* Lichen is a mutual association of an alga
and a fungus.

* Roots of terrestrial plants and fungal
hyphae- Mycorrhiza

**b. Commensalism:**It is an interaction between
two organisms in which one is benefitted and
the other is neither benefitted nor harmed.
The species that derives benefit is called the
**commensal**, while the other species is called the
host. The common examples of commensalism
are listed below:

![Figure 6.10: A nodulated legume plant root with bacteria](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic14.png )



**Epiphytes**

The plants
which are found
growing on
other plants
without harming
them are called
epiphytes. They
are commonly
found in tropical
rain forest.

![Figure 6.11: An epiphytic plant-Vanda](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic15.png )

The epiphytic higher plant **(Orchid)** gets
its nutrients and water from the atmosphere
with the help of the hygroscopic roots which
contain special type of spongy tissue called
**Velamen.** It prepares its own food and does
not depend on the host. Using the host plant
only they support and does not harm it in any
way.

* Many orchids, ferns, lianas, hanging mosses,
Peperomia, money plant and Usnea (Lichen)
are some of the examples of epiphytes.

*  Spanish Moss –Tillandsia grows on the bark
of Oak and Pine trees.

{{< box title="Do You Know" type="objective" >}}

**Proto Cooperation**

An interaction between
organisms of different
species in which both
organisms benefit but neither is dependent
on the relationship. Example: Soil bacteria /
fungi and plants growing in the soil.

{{< /box >}}



**Negative interactions**

When one of the interacting species is benefitted
and the other is harmed, it is called negative
interaction . Examples: predation, parasitism,
competition and amensalism.

**a. Predation:** It is an interaction between two
species, one of which captures, kills and eats
up the other. The species which kills is called
a **predator** and the species which is killed is
called a **prey.** The predator is benefitted while
the prey is harmed.

**Examples:**

*  A number of
plants like Drosera
(Sun dew Plant),
Nepenthes (Pitcher
Plant), Dionaea
(Venus fly trap),
Utricularia (Bladder
wort) and Sarracenia
are predators which
consume insects and
other small animals
for their food as a source of nitrogen. They
are also called as **insectivorous plants.**

![Figure 6.12: Pitcher plant – with insect](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic16.png )

*  Many herbivores are predators. Cattles,
Camels, Goats etc., frequently browse on
the tender shoots of herbs, shrubs and
trees. Generally annuals suffer more than
the perennials. Grazing and browsing may
cause remarkable changes in vegetation.
Nearly 25 percent of all insects are known
as phytophagous(feeds on plant sap and
other parts of plant)

![Figure 6.13: Insectivorous plant Utricularia](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic17.png )

*  Many defense mechanisms are evolved to
avoid their predations by plants. Examples:
Calotropis produces highly poisonous cardiac
glycosides, Tobacco produces nicotine, coffee
plants produce caffeine, Cinchona plant
produces quinine. Thorns of Bougainvillea,
spines of Opuntia, and latex of cacti also
protect them from predators.

**b. Parasitism:** It is an interaction between two
different species in which the smaller partner
(parasite) obtains food from the larger partner
(host or plant). So the parasitic species is
benefited while the host species is harmed. Based
on the host-parasite relationship, parasitism is
classified into two types they are holoparasite
and hemiparasite.

**Holoparasites**

The organisms which are dependent upon the
host plants for their entire nutrition are called
**Holoparasites.** They are also called **total parasites**.

![Figure 6.14: a) Holoparasite – Cuscuta b) A Partial stem parasite – Viscum c) Root parasite on the brinjal root Orobanche spp. ](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic18.png )

Examples:

* Cuscuta is a total stem parasite of the
host plant Acacia, Duranta and many
other plants. Cuscuta even gets flower
inducing hormone from its host plant.

* Balanophora, Orobanche and Rafflesia
are the total root parasites found on
higher plants.

**Hemiparasites**

The organisms which derive only water
and minerals from their host plant while
synthesizing their own food by photosynthesis
are called **Hemiparasites** They are also called
**partial parasites**.

**Examples:**

* *Viscum* and *Loranthus* are partial stem
parasites.

* *Santalum* (Sandal Wood) is a partial root
parasite.

The parasitic plants produce the **haustorial roots** inside the host plant to absorb nutrients
from the vascular tissues of host plants.

**c. Competition:** It is an interaction between
two organisms or species in which both the
organisms or species are harmed. Competition
is the severest in population that has irregular
distribution. Competition is classified into
intraspecific and interspecific.

**1. Intraspecific competition:** It is an interaction
between individuals of the same species. This
competition is very severe because all the
members of species have similar requirements of
food, habitat, pollination etc. and they also have
similar adaptations to fulfill their needs.


**2. Interspecific competition:** It is an interaction
between individuals of different species. In
grassland, many species of grasses grow well as
there is little competition when enough nutrients
and water is available. During drought shortage
of water occurs . A life and death competition
starts among the different species of grass lands.
Survival in both these competitions is determined
by the quantity of nutrients, availability of water
and migration to new areas. Different species of
herbivores, larvae and grass hopper competing
for fodder or forage plants. Trees, shrubs and
herbs in a forest struggle for sunlight, water and
nutrients and also for pollination and dispersal of
fruits and seeds. The Utricularia (Bladderwort)
competes with tiny fishes for small crustaceans
and insectS.

**d. Amensalism:** It is an interspecific interaction
in which one species is inhibited while the other
species is neither benefitted nor harmed. The
inhibition is achieved by the secretion of certain
chemicals called **allelopathic** substances.

Amensalism is also called **antibiosis.**

* Penicillium notatum produces penicillin to
inhibit the growth of a variety of bacteria
especially Staphylococcus.

* Trichoderma inhibits the growth of fungus
Aspergillus.

*  Roots and hulls of Black Walnut Juglans
nigra secretes an alkaloid Juglone which
inhibits the growth of seedlings of Apple,
Tomato and Alfalfa around it.

**Interspecific interactions/ Co-evolutionary dynamics**

**i. Mimicry:** It is a phenomenon in which
living organism modifies its form, appearance,
structure or behavior and looks like another
living organism as a self defence and increases
the chance of its survival. Floral mimicry is
for usually inviting pollinators but animal
mimicry is often protective. Mimicry is a result
of evolutionary significance due to shape and
sudden heritable mutation and preservation by
natural selection.


![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic19.png )

Example:

* The plant, Ophrys an orchid, the flower looks
like a female insect to attract the male insect
to get pollinated by the male insect and it is
otherwise called ‘floral mimicry ‘.


* Carausium morosus – stick insect or
walking stick. It is a protective mimicry
• Phyllium frondosum – leaf insect, another
example of protective mimicry.

**ii. Myrmecophily:** Sometimes, ants take their
shelter on some trees such as Mango, Litchi,
Jamun, Acacia etc. These ants act as body
guards of the plants against any disturbing
agent and the plants in turn provide food
and shelter to these ants. This phenomenon
is known as Myrmecophily. Example: Acacia
and acacia ants.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic20.png )

**iii. Co-evolution:** The interaction between
organisms, when continues for generations,
involves reciprocal changes in genetic and
morphological characters of both organisms.
This type of evolution is called Co-evolution.
It is a kind of co- adaptation and mutual
change among interactive species.
Examples:

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic21.png )

	
* Corolla length and proboscis length of
butterflies and moths ( Habenaria and Moth ).

* Bird’s beak shape and flower shape and size.

*  More examples: Horn bills and birds
of Scrub jungles ,Slit size of pollinia of
Apocynaceae members and leg size of
insects.

### 6.3 Ecological adaptations

The modifications in the structure of
organisms to survive successfully in an
environment are called adaptations of
organisms. Adaptations help the organisms to
exist under the prevailing ecological habitat.
Based on the habitats and the corresponding
adaptations of plants, they are classified
as hydrophytes, xerophytes, mesophytes,
epiphytes and halophytes.

**Hydrophytes**

The plants which are living in water or wet
places are called hydrophytes. According to
their relation to water and air, they are sub-
divided into following categories: i) Free
floating hydrophytes, ii) Rooted- floating
hydrophytes, iii) Submerged floating
hydrophytes, iv) Rooted -submerged
hydrophytes, v) Amphibious hydrophytes.
i. Free floating hydrophytes: These plants
float freely on the surface of water. They
remain in contact with water and air, but not
with soil. Examples: Eichhornia, Pistia and
Wolffia (smallest flowering plant).
ii. Rooted floating hydrophytes: In these
plants, the roots are fixed in mud, but their
leaves and flowers are floating on the surface
of water. These plants are in contact with soil,
water and air. Examples: *Nelumbo, Nymphaea, Potomogeton and Marsilea.*

**Lotus seeds show highest longevity in plant kingdom.**

**iii. Submerged floating hydrophytes:** These
plants are completely submerged in water and
not in contact with soil and air. Examples:
*Ceratophyllum and Utricularia.*


**iv. Rooted- submerged hydrophytes:** These
plants are completely submerged in water
and rooted in soil and not in contact with air.
*Examples: Hydrilla, Vallisneria and Isoetes.*

**v. Amphibious hydrophytes** (Rooted emergent
hydrophytes): These plants are adapted to both

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic22.png )

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic23.png )

aquatic and terrestrial modes of life. They grow
in shallow water. Examples: Ranunculus, Typha
and Sagittaria.

**Hygrophytes:** The plants which can grow
in moist damp and shady places are called
hygrophytes. Examples: Habenaria (Orchid),
Mosses (Bryophytes), etc.

### Morphological adaptations of Hydrophytes:
**In root**

* Roots are totally absent in Wolffia and
Salvinia or poorly developed in Hydrilla or
well developed in *Ranunculus.*

* The root caps are replaced by root pockets.
*Example: Eichhornia*

**In stem**


* The stem is long, slender, spongy and flexible
in submerged forms.

*  In free floating forms the stem is thick, short
stoloniferous and spongy; and in rooted
floating forms, it is a rhizome .

* Vegetative propagation is through runners,
stolon, stem and root cuttings , tubers,
dormant apices and offsets.

**In leaves**

* The leaves are thin, long and ribbon shaped in
*Vallisneria* or long and linear in Potamogeton
or finely dissected in *Ceratophyllum*

* The floating leaves are large and flat as in
Nymphaea and Nelumbo. In Eichhornia and
Trapa petioles become swollen and spongy.

* In emergent forms, the leaves show
heterophylly (Submerged leaves are
dissected and aerial leaves are entire).

**Example:**
*Ranunculus,Limnophila , heterophylla and Sagittaria*

**Anatomical adaptations**

* Cuticle is either completely absent or if
present it is thin and poorly developed

* Single layer of epidermis is present

* Cortex is well developed with aerenchyma

*	Vascular tissues are poorly developed. In
emergent forms vascular elements are well
developed.

*	Mechanical tissues are generally absent
except in some emergent forms. Pith cells
are sclerenchymatous.
 
 ![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic24.png )

 **Physiological adaptations of Hydrophytes:**

* Hydrophytes have the ability to withstand
anaerobic conditions .
* They possess special aerating organs.

**Xerophytes**

The plants which are living in dry or xeric
condition are known as Xerophytes. Xerophytic
habitat can be of two different types. They are:

**a. Physical dryness:** In these habitats, soil has a
little amount of water due to the inability of the
soil to hold water because of low rainfall

**b. Physiological dryness:** In these habitats,
water is sufficiently present but plants are unable
to absorb it because of the absence of capillary
spaces. Example: Plants in salty and acidic soil.

Based on adaptive characters xerophytes
are classified into three categories. They are
Ephemerals, Succulents and Non succulent
plants.

**i. Ephemerals:**
These are also
called drought
escapers
or **drought evaders.**
These
plants
complete their
life cycle within
a short period
**(single season).**
These are not true xerophytes. Examples:
Argemone, Mollugo, Tribulus and Tephrosia.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic25.png )

**ii. Succulents:** These are also called drought
**enduring plants**. These plants store water in
their plant parts during the dry period. These
plants develop certain adaptive characters to
resist extreme drought conditions. Examples:
*Opuntia, Aloe, Bryophyllum and Begonia.*

**iii. Non succulents:** These are also called
**drought resistant plants ( true xerophytes).**
They face both external and internal dryness.
They have many adaptations to resist dry
conditions. 
*Examples: Casuarina, Nerium, Zizyphus and Acacia.*

**ii. Succulents:** These are also called drought
**enduring plants.**These plants store water in
their plant parts during the dry period. These
plants develop certain adaptive characters to
resist extreme drought conditions. 
*Examples: Opuntia, Aloe, Bryophyllum and Begonia.*

**iii. Non succulents:** These are also called
**drought resistant plants ( true xerophytes).**
They face both external and internal dryness.
They have many adaptations to resist dry
conditions. *Examples: Casuarina, Nerium,*
*Zizyphus and Acacia.*

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic26.png )

**Morphological Adaptations**

**In root**

* Root system is well developed and is greater
than that of shoot system.

* Root hairs and root caps are also well developed.

In xerophytic plants with the leaves and
stem are covered with hairs are called
**trichophyllous plants**. Example: Cucurbits
(Melothria and Mukia )

**In stem**

* Stems are mostly hard and woody. They may
be aerial or underground

* The stems and leaves are covered with wax
coating or covered with dense hairs.

* In some xerophytes all the internodes in the
stem are modified into a fleshy leaf structure
called **phylloclades (Opuntia)** .

* In some of the others single or occasionally
two internodes modified into fleshy green
structure called **cladode** (Asparagus).
In some the petiole is modified into a fleshy
leaf like structurcalled phyllode (Acacia
melanoxylon)..

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic27.png )


a) A succulent xerophyte: Phylloclade – opuntia

b) Non succulent: Perennial - Capparis

c) Cladode of Asparagus

d) Phyllode – Acacia

In leaves

* Leaves are generally leathery and shiny to
reflect light and heat.

* In some plants like Euphorbia, Acacia,
Ziziphus and Capparis, the stipules are
modified into spines.

* The entire leaves are modified into spines
(Opuntia ) or reduced to scales (Asparagus).


**Anatomical adaptations**


* Presence of multilayered epidermis with
heavy cuticle to prevent water loss due to
transpiration.

* Hypodermis is well developed with
sclerenchymatous tissues.

* Sunken stomata are present only in the lower
epidermis with hairs in the sunken pits.


* Scotoactive type of stomata found in
succulent plants .

* Vascular bundles are well developed with
several layered bundle sheath.

* Mesophyll is well differentiated into
palisade and spongy parenchyma.

* In succulents the stem possesses a water
storage region.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic28.png )

**Physiological adaptations**

* Most of the physiological processes are
designed to reduce transpiration.

* Life cycle is completed within a short
period (Ephemerals).


### Mesophytes

The plants which are living in moderate
conditions (neither too wet nor too dry) are
known as **mesophytes**. These are common land
plants. Example: Maize and Hibiscus.

**Morphological adaptations**

* Root system is well developed with root
caps and root hairs

* Stems are generally aerial, stout and highly
branched.

* Leaves are generally large, broad, thin with
different shapes.


### Anatomical adaptations

* Cuticle in aerial parts are moderately
developed.

* Epidermis is well developed and stomata are
generally present on both the epidermis.

* Mesophyll is well differentiated into palisade
and spongy parenchyma.

* Vascular and mechanical tissues are fairly
developed and well differentiated.


**Physiological adaptations**

* All physiological processes are normal.

* Temporary wilting takes place at room
temperature when there is water scarcity.

**Tropophytes** are plants which behave
as xerophytes at summer and behave as
mesophytes (or) hydrophytes during rainy
season.

**Epiphytes**

Epiphytes are plants which grow perched on
other plants (Supporting plants). They use
the supporting plants only as shelter and not
for water or food supply. These epiphytes
are commonly seen in tropical rain forests.
Examples: Orchids, Lianas, Hanging Mosses
and Money plant.

**Morphological adaptations**

* Root system is extensively developed. These
roots may be of two types. They are Clinging
roots and Aerial roots.

* **Clinging roots** fix the epiphytes firmly on
the surface of the supporting objects.

**Aerial roots** are green coloured roots which
may hang downwardly and absorb moisture
from the atmosphere with the help of a
spongy tissue called **velamen**

* Stem of some epiphytes are succulent and
develop pseudobulb or tuber.

* Generally the leaves are lesser in number
and may be fleshy and leathery

* Myrmecophily is a common occurrence
in the epiphytic vegetation to prevent the
predators.

* The fruits and seeds are very small and
usually dispersed by wind, insects and birds.

### Anatomical adaptations

* Multilayered epidermis is present. Inner to
the velamen tissue, the peculiar exodermis
layer is present.

* Presence of thick cuticle and sunken stomata
greatly reduces transpiration.

* Succulent epiphytes contain well developed
parenchymatous cells to store water.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic29.png )


**Physiological adaptations**

Special absorption processes of water by
velamen tissue .

**Halophytes**

There are special type of Halophytic plants
which grow on soils with high concentration
of salts. Examples: *Rhizophora, Sonneratia and*
*Avicennia.*

Halophytes are usually found near the sea-
shores and Estuaries. The soils are physically
wet but physiologically dry. As plants cannot use
salt water directly they require filtration of salt
using physiological processes. This vegetation is
also known as **mangrove forest** and the plants
are called **mangroves.**

**Morphological adaptations**

* The temperate halophytes are herbaceous
but the tropical halophytes are mostly bushy

* In addition to the normal roots, many stilt
roots are developed

* A special type of negatively geotropic
roots called **pneumatophores** with
pneumathodes to get sufficient aeration
are also present. They are called breathing
roots. *Example: Avicennia*

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic30.png )


![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic31.png )

### Anatomical adaptations

* Epidermal cells of stem is heavy cutinized,
almost squarish and are filled with oil and
tannins.

* **‘Star’ shaped sclereids and ‘H’ shaped** heavy
thickened spicules that provide mechanical
strength to cortex are present in the stem.

* The leaves may be dorsiventral or isobilateral
with **salt secreting glands.**


### Physiological adaptations


* High osmotic pressure exists in some
plants .

* Seeds germinate in the fruits while on the
mother plant (Vivipary).

**DO YOU KNOW**

Out of three districts of Tamil
Nadu (Nagapattinam, Thanjavur
and Thiruvarur), Muthupet
(Thiruvarur district) was less damaged by
Gaja cyclone ( November 2018) due to the
presence of mangrove forest.

#### 6.4 Dispersal of Fruits and Seeds

Both fruits and seeds possess attractive colour,
odour, shape and taste needed for the dispersal
by birds, mammals, reptiles, fish, ants and
insects even earthworms. The seed consists
of an embryo, stored food material and a
protective covering called seed coat. As seeds
contain miniature but dormant future plants,
their dispersal is an important criterion for
distribution and establishment of plants over
a wide geographical area. The dissemination of
seeds and fruits to various distances from the
parent plant is called seed and fruit dispersal.
It takes place with the help of ecological factors
such as wind, water and animals.

Seed dispersal is a regeneration process
of plant populations and a common means of
colonizing new areas to avoid seedling level
competition and from natural enemies like
herbivores, frugivores and pathogens.

Fruit maturation and seed dispersal is
influenced by many ecologically favourable
conditions such as Season (Example: Summer),
suitable environment, and seasonal availability
of dispersal agents like birds, insects etc.


Seeds require agents for dispersal which
are crucial in plant community dynamics in
many ecosystems around the globe. They offer
many benefits to communities such as food and
nutrients, migration of seeds across habitats
and helps spreading plant genetic diversity.

### 6.4.1 Dispersal by Wind (Anemochory)

The individual seeds or the whole fruit may be
modified to help for the dispersal by wind. Wind
dispersal of fruits and seeds is quite common in
tall trees. The adaptation of the wind dispersed
plants are

*  Minute seeds: Seeds are minute, very
small, light and with inflated covering.
*Example: Orchids.*

* Wings: Seeds or whole fruits are flattened to
form a wing. Examples: Maple, Gyrocarpus,
*Dipterocarpus and Terminalia*

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic32.png )



* Feathery Appendages: Seeds or fruits may
have feathery appendages which greatly
increase their buoyancy to disperse to high
altitudes. Examples: Vernonia and Asclepias.

* C ensor mechanisms: The fruits of many
plants open in such a way that the seeds
can escape only when the fruit is violently
shaken by a strong wind. Examples:
Aristolochia and Poppy.


Guess!! Who am I…….? I am dispersed by
ant and I have caruncle.


### 6.4.2 Dispersal by Water (Hydrochory)

Dispersal of seeds and fruits by water usually
occurs in those plants which grow in or near
water bodies . Adaptation of hydrochory are


*  Obconical receptacle with prominent air
spaces. Example: Nelumbo.

* Presence of fibrous mesocarp and light
pericarp. Example: Coconut.

* Seeds are light, small, provided with aril
which encloses air.Example: Nymphaea.

* The fruit may be inflated. Examples:
Heritiera littoralis.

* Seeds by themselves would not float may be
carried by water current. Example: Coconut.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic33.png )

### 6.4.3 Dispersal by Animals (Zoochory)

Birds and mammals, including human beings
play an efficient and important role in the
dispersal of fruit and seeds. They have the
following devices.

**i. Hooked fruit:** The surface of the fruit or seeds
have hooks,(Xanthium), barbs (Andropogon),
spines (Aristida) by means of which they adhere
to the body of animals or clothes of human
beings and get dispersed.

**ii. Sticky fruits and seeds:**

**a.** Some fruits have sticky glandular hairs by
which they adhere to the fur of grazing animals.
**Example: Boerhaavia and Cleome.**

**b.** Some fruits have viscid layer which adhere to
the beak of the bird which eat them and when
they rub them on to the branch of the tree, they
disperse and germinate. 
*Example: Cordia and Alangium*

**iii.** Fleshy fruits: Some fleshy fruits with
conspicuous colours are dispersed by human
beings to distant places after consumption.
*Example: Mango and Diplocyclos*

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic34.png )


### 6.4.3 Dispersal by Explosive Mechanism (Autochory)

Some fruits burst suddenly with a force
enabling to throw seeds to a little distance away
from the plant. Autochory shows the following
adaptations.

* 	Mere touch of some plants causes the
ripened fruit to explode suddenly and seeds
are thrown out with great force. Example:
Impatiens (Balsam), Hura.

* Some fruits when they come in contact with
water particularly after a shower of rain,
burst suddenly with a noise and scatter the
seeds.Examples: Ruellia and Crossandra.

* Certain long pods explode with a loud
noise like cracker, scattering the seeds in
all directions. Example: Bauhinia vahlii
(Camel’s foot climber)

* As the fruit matures, tissues around seeds are
converted into a mucilaginous fluid, due to
which a high turgor pressure develops inside
the fruit which leads to the dispersal of seeds.

Example: *Ecballium elatrium* (Squirting cucumber) Gyrocarpus and Dipterocarpus.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic35.png )

### Human aided seed dispersal

Seed Ball : Seed ball
is an ancient Japanese
technique of encasing
seeds in a mixture of
clay and soil humus
(also in cow dung) and
scattering them on to
suitable ground, not planting of trees manually.
This method is suitable for barren and degraded
lands for tree regeneration and vegetation before
monsoon period where the suitable dispersal
agents become rare.

September 16 - International Ozone day

**Advantages of seed dispersal:**

Seeds escape from mortality near the
* parent plants due to predation by animals
or getting diseases and also avoiding
competition.

* Dispersal also gives a chance to occupy
favourable sites for growth.

* It is an important process in the movement
of plant genes particularly this is the only
method available for self-fertilized flowers
and maternally transmitted genes in
outcrossing plants.

* Seed dispersal by animals help in
conservation of many species even in
human altered ecosystems.

* Understanding of fruits and seed dispersal
acts as a key for proper functioning and
establishment of many ecosystems from
deserts to evergreen forests and also for the
maintenance of biodiversity conservation
and restoration of ecosystems.

**Summary**

Ecology is a division of biology and deals
with the study of environment in relation to
organisms. Ecology is mainly divided into
two branches Autecology and Synecology. The
environment (surrounding) includes physical,
chemical and biological components. These
factors can be classified into living (biotic)
and non-living (abiotic), which make the
environment of an organism. The ecological
factors are meaningfully grouped into four
classes, which are as follows: 1. Climatic factors
2. Edaphic factors 3. Topographic factors 4.
Biotic factors.

Climate is one of the important natural
factors controlling the plant life. The climatic
factors includes light, temperature, water,
wind, fire, etc. Edaphic factors, the abiotic
factors related to soil, include the physical and
chemical composition of the soil formed in a
particular area. The surface features of earth
are called topography. Topographic influence
on the climate of any area is determined by
the interaction of solar radiation, temperature,
humidity ,rainfall, latitude and altitude. The
interactions among living organisms, the plants
and animals are called biotic factors, which may
cause marked effects upon vegetation.

The modifications in the structure of
organisms to survive successfully in an
environment are called adaptations of
organisms. Based on the habitats and the
corresponding adaptations of plants, they are
classified into 1) Hydrophytes 2) Xerophytes
3) Mesophytes 4) Epiphytes and 5) Halophytes.

The dissemination of seeds and fruits to various
distances from the parent plant is called **seed and fruit dispersal**. It takes place with the help
of ecological factors such as wind, water and
animals.
