### Learning Objectives

The learner will be able to
* Understand the interaction between
organisms and their
environment.

* Describe biotic and
abiotic factors that
influence the dynamics of
populations.

* Describe how organisms
adapt themselves to environmental changes.
 
* Learn the structure of various fruits and
seeds related to their dispersal mechanism.

##### 6.1 Ecology

##### 6.2 Ecological factors

##### 6.3 Ecological adaptations

##### 6.4 Dispersal of seeds and fruits


Ecology is a division of biology which deals
with the study of environment in relation to
organisms. It can be studied by considering
individual organisms, population, community,
biome or biosphere and their environment.
While observing our different environments,
one can ask questions like 

* Why do plants or animals vary with places?

* What are the causes for variation in
biological diversity of different places?


* How soil, climate and other physical features
affect the flora and fauna or vice versa?

These questions can be better answered with
the study of ecology.

Ecology is essentially a practical science
involving experiments, continuous
observations to predict how organisms react
to particular environmental circumstances
and understanding the principles involved in
ecology.

### <u> 6.1 Ecology </u>

The term “ecology”
**(oekologie)** is derived from
two Greek words – **oikos**
(meaning house or dwelling
place and **logos** meaning
study) It was first proposed by
Reiter (1868). However, the
most widely accepted definition of ecology was
given by **Ernest Haeckel** (1869).

**Alexander von Humbolt** - Father of Ecology

**Eugene P. Odum** - Father of modern Ecology

**R. Misra** - Father of Indian Ecology


#### <u> 6.1.1 Definitions of ecology </u>

“The study of living organisms, both plants and
animals, in their natural habitats or homes.”

**- Reiter (1885)**

“Ecology is the study of the reciprocal
relationship between living organisms and their
environment.” **- Earnest Haeckel (1889)**


#### <u> 6.1.2 Ecological hierarchy </u>

The interaction of organisms with their
environment results in the establishment of
grouping of organisms which is called ecological
hierarchy or ecological levels of organization.
The basic unit of ecological hierarchy is an
individual organism. The hierarchy of ecological
systems is illustrated below:

#### <u> 6.1.3 Branches of Ecology: </u>

Ecology is mainly divided into two branches,
they are autecology and synecology

1. Autecology is the ecology of an individual
species and is also called species ecology.

2. Synecology is the ecology of a population or
community with one or more species and also
called as community ecology.

Many advances and developments in the field
ecology resulted in various new dimensions
and branches. Some of the advanced fields are
Molecular ecology, Eco technology, Statistical
ecology and Environmental toxicology

#### <u> 6.1.4 Habitat and Niche </u>

**Habitat**

Habitat is a specific physical place or locality
occupied by an organism or any species which
has a particular combination of abiotic or
environmental factors. But the environment of
any community is called **Biotope.**

**Niche**

An ecological niche refers to an organism’s place
in the biotic environment and its functional
role in an ecosystem. The term was coined by
the naturalist **Roswell Hill Johnson but Grinell**
(1917) was probably first to use this term. The 
habitat and niche of any organism is called
**Ecotope**

**The differences between habitat and niche are as follows.**

**<u>Applied ecology or environmental technology :</u>**

Application of the
Science of ecology is
otherwise called as **Applied ecology** or
**Environmental technology.** It helps us to
manage and conserve natural resources,
particularly ecosystems, forest and wild
life conservative and management.
Environmental management involves
Bio-diversity conservation, Ecosystem
restoration, Habitat management,
Invasive species management, Protected
areas management and also help us plan
landscapes and environmental impact
designing for the futuristic ecology.

#### <u> 6.1.5 Ecological equivalents </u>

Taxonomically different species occupying
similar habitats (Niches) in different geographical
regions are called **Ecological equivalents.**
