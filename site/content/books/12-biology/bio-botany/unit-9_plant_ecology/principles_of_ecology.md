Ecology is a division of biology which deals
with the study of environment in relation to
organisms. It can be studied by considering
individual organisms, population, community,
biome or biosphere and their environment.
While observing our different environments,
one can ask questions like 

* Why do plants or animals vary with places?

* What are the causes for variation in
biological diversity of different places?


* How soil, climate and other physical features
affect the flora and fauna or vice versa?

These questions can be better answered with
the study of ecology.

Ecology is essentially a practical science
involving experiments, continuous
observations to predict how organisms react
to particular environmental circumstances
and understanding the principles involved in
ecology.

### <u> 6.1 Ecology </u>

The term “ecology”
**(oekologie)** is derived from
two Greek words – **oikos**
(meaning house or dwelling
place and **logos** meaning
study) It was first proposed by
Reiter (1868). However, the
most widely accepted definition of ecology was
given by **Ernest Haeckel** (1869). 

![Unit 9 ](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic1.png )


**Alexander von Humbolt** - Father of Ecology

**Eugene P. Odum** - Father of modern Ecology

**R. Misra** - Father of Indian Ecology


#### <u> 6.1.1 Definitions of ecology </u>

“The study of living organisms, both plants and
animals, in their natural habitats or homes.”

**- Reiter (1885)**

“Ecology is the study of the reciprocal
relationship between living organisms and their
environment.” **- Earnest Haeckel (1889)**


#### <u> 6.1.2 Ecological hierarchy </u>

The interaction of organisms with their
environment results in the establishment of
grouping of organisms which is called ecological
hierarchy or ecological levels of organization.
The basic unit of ecological hierarchy is an
individual organism. The hierarchy of ecological
systems is illustrated below:


![Unit 9 - flowchart 1](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic2.png )

#### <u> 6.1.3 Branches of Ecology: </u>

Ecology is mainly divided into two branches,
they are autecology and synecology

1. Autecology is the ecology of an individual
species and is also called species ecology.

2. Synecology is the ecology of a population or
community with one or more species and also
called as community ecology.

Many advances and developments in the field
ecology resulted in various new dimensions
and branches. Some of the advanced fields are
Molecular ecology, Eco technology, Statistical
ecology and Environmental toxicology

#### <u> 6.1.4 Habitat and Niche </u>

**Habitat**

Habitat is a specific physical place or locality
occupied by an organism or any species which
has a particular combination of abiotic or
environmental factors. But the environment of
any community is called **Biotope.**

**Niche**

An ecological niche refers to an organism’s place
in the biotic environment and its functional
role in an ecosystem. The term was coined by
the naturalist **Roswell Hill Johnson but Grinell**
(1917) was probably first to use this term. The 
habitat and niche of any organism is called
**Ecotope**

**The differences between habitat and niche are as follows.**

**<u>Applied ecology or environmental technology :</u>**

Application of the
Science of ecology is
otherwise called as **Applied ecology** or
**Environmental technology.** It helps us to
manage and conserve natural resources,
particularly ecosystems, forest and wild
life conservative and management.
Environmental management involves
Bio-diversity conservation, Ecosystem
restoration, Habitat management,
Invasive species management, Protected
areas management and also help us plan
landscapes and environmental impact
designing for the futuristic ecology.

#### <u> 6.1.5 Ecological equivalents </u>

Taxonomically different species occupying
similar habitats (Niches) in different geographical
regions are called **Ecological equivalents.**

**Examples:**

* Certain species of epiphytic orchids of
Western Ghats of India differ from the
epiphytic orchids of South America. But
they are epiphytes.

* Species of the grass lands of Western Ghats
of India differ from the grass species of
temperate grass lands of Steppe in North
America. But they are all ecologically
primary producers and fulfilling similar
roles in their respective communities.

![Figure 6.1: Environmental factors affecting a plant](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic3.png )

#### <u> 6.2 Ecological factors </u>

Many organisms, co-exist in an environment.
The environment (surrounding) includes
physical, chemical and biological components.
When a component surrounding an organism
affects the life of an organism, it becomes a
factor. All such factors together are called
environmental factors or ecological factors.
These factors can be classified into living
(biotic) and non-living (abiotic) which make
the environment of an organism. However the
ecological factors are meaningfully grouped
into four classes, which are as follows:

i. Climatic factors

ii. Edaphic factors

iii. Topographic factors

iv. Biotic factors

We will discuss the above factors in a concise
manner.

{{< box title="Learning Objectives" type="objective" >}}

###### DO YOU KNOW? 


Flowers of poppy, chicory,
dog rose and many other
plants, blossom before the
break of dawn (4 – 5 am),
evening primrose open up with the onset
of dusk (5 – 6 pm) due to diurnal rhythm.

{{< /box >}}

#### <u> 6.2.1 Climatic Factors </u>

Climate is one of the important natural factors
controlling the plant life. The climatic factors
includes light, temperature, water, wind and
fire.

**a. Light**

Light is a well known factor needed for the
basic physiological processes of plants, such as
photosynthesis, transpiration, seed germination
and flowering. The portion of the sunlight which
can be resolved by the human eye is called
**visible light.** The visible part of light is madeup of wavelength from about 400 nm (violet)
to 700 nm **(red)**. The rate of photosynthesis is
maximum at **blue** (400 – 500 nm) and red (600 –
700 nm). The **green**(500 – 600 nm) wave length
of spectrum is less strongly absorbed by plants.

**Effects of light on plants**


![Figure 6.2: Various effects of light upon a green plant](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic4.png )

Based on the tolerance to intensities of light,
the plants are divided into two types. They are 

1. Heliophytes - Light loving plants.
Example: Angiosperms.


2. Sciophytes - Shade loving plants.
Example: Bryophytes and Pteridophytes.

In deep sea (>500m), the environment is
dark and its inhabitants are not aware of the
existence of celestial source of energy called
Sun. What, then is their source of energy?


{{< box title="Learning Objectives" type="objective" >}}

###### DO YOU KNOW? 

Palaeoclimatology–Helps to
reconstruct past climates of
our planet and flora, fauna
and ecosystem in which they
lived. Example: Air bubbles trapped in ice
for tens of thousands of years with fossilized
pollen, coral, plant and animal debris.

{{< /box >}}


**b. Temperature**

Temperature is one of the important factors
which affect almost all the metabolic activities
of an organism. Every physiological process in
an organism requires an optimum temperature
at which it shows the maximum metabolic rate.
Three limits of temperature can be recognized
for any organism. They are

1.**Minimum temperature**- Physiological
activities are lowest.

2. **Optimum temperature**- Physiological
activities are maximum.

3. **Maximum temperature** - Physiological
activities will stop.

Based on the temperature prevailing in
an area, **Raunkiaer** classified the world’s
vegetation into the following four types. They
are megatherms, mesotherms, microtherms
and hekistotherms. In thermal springs and deep
sea hydrothermal vents the average temperature
exceed 100<sup>o</sup>C.

Based on the range of **thermal tolerance,**
organisms are divided into two types.

**1. Eurythermal:** Organisms which can tolerate
a wide range of temperature fluctuations.
Example: Zostera (A marine Angiosperm) and
Artemisia tridentata.


**2. Stenothermal:** Organisms which can
tolerate only small range of temperature
variations. Example: Mango and Palm
(Terrestrial Angiosperms).

Mango plant does not grow in temperate
countries like Canada and Germany

#### <u>Thermal Stratification </u>

It is usually found in aquatic habitat. The
change in the temperature profile with
increasing depth in a water body is called
**thermal stratification**. There are three levels
of thermal stratifications.

![Figure 6.3: Thermal stratification of pond](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic5.png )

1. Epilimnion – The upper layer of warmer
water.

2. Metalimnion – The middle layer with a
zone of gradual decrease in temperature.

3. Hypolimnion - The bottom layer of colder water.

**Temperature based zonation**

Variations in **latitude** and **altitude** do affect the
temperature and the vegetation on the earth
surface. The latitudinal and altitudinal zonation
of vegetation is illustrated below:

**Latitude:** Latitude is an angle which ranges
from 00 at the equator to 900 at the poles.


**Altitude:** How high a place is located above
the sea level is called the altitude of the place.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic6.png )


**Timber line / Tree line :** It is an imaginary
line in a mountain or higher areas of land
that marks the level above which trees do
not grow. The altitudinal limit of normal tree
growth is about **3000 to 4000m.**

**Effects of temperature**

The following physiological processes are
influenced by temperature:

* Temperature affects the enzymatic action
of all the bio-chemical reactions in a plant
body.

* It influences CO2 and O2 solubility in the
biological systems. Increases respiration
and stimulates growth of seedlings.

* Low temperature with high humidity can
cause spread of diseases in plants.

* The varying temperature with moisture
determines the distribution of the
vegetation types.

**c. Water**


Water is one of the most important climatic
factors. It affects the vital processes of all living
organisms. It is believed that even life had
originated only in water during the evolution of
Earth. Water covers more than 70% of the earth’s
surface. In nature, water is available to plants in
three ways. They are **atmospheric moisture,**
**precipitation and soil water.**

{{< box title="Learning Objectives" type="objective" >}}

###### DO YOU KNOW? 

**Evergreen forests** – Found
where heavy rainfall occurs
throughout the year.

**Sclerophyllous forests** –
Found where heavy rainfall occurs during
winter and low rainfall during summer.

{{< /box >}}

The productivity and distribution of plants depend
upon the availability of water. Further the quality
of water is also important especially for the aquatic
organisms. The total amount of water salinity in
different water bodies are :i).5% in inland water
(Fresh water) ii).30 – 35% in sea water and iii).
More than 100% in hypersaline water **(Lagoons)**
Based on the range of tolerance of salinity,
organisms are divided into two types.

**1. Euryhaline:** Organisms which can live in
water with wide range of salinity. Examples:
Marine algae and marina angiosperms


**2. Stenohaline:** Organisms which can withstand 
only small range of salinity. Example: Plants of
estuaries.

![Table 6.2: Tolerance of Environmental factor](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic7.png )


**Examples of tolerance to toxicity**

i. Soyabean and tomato manage to tolerate
presence of cadmium poisoning by isolating
cadmium and storing into few group of cells
and prevent cadmium affecting other cells .
ii. Rice and Eichhornia (water hyacinth ) tolerate
cadmium by binding it to their proteins.

These plants otherwise can also be used to
remove cadmium from contaminated soil ,this
is known as **Phytoremediation.**

**d. Wind**


Air in motion is called wind. It is also a
vital ecological factor. The atmospheric air
contains a number of gases, particles and
other constituents. The composition of gases
in atmosphere is as follows: Nitrogen -78% ,
Oxygen -21%, Carbon-di-oxide -0.03%, Argon
and other gases - 0.93%. The other components
of wind are water vapour, gaseous pollutants,
dust, smoke particles, microorganisms,
pollen grains, spores, etc. **Anemometer** is the
instrument used to measure the speed of wind.

{{< box title="Learning Objectives" type="objective" >}}

###### DO YOU KNOW? 

**Green House Effect Albedo Effect**

Gases let out to atmosphere
causes climatic change.
Emission of dust and aerosols (small solids
or liquid particles in suspension in the
atmosphere) from industries, automobiles,
forest fire, So2 and DMS (dimethyl sulphur)
play an important role in disturbing the
temperature level of any region. Aerosols
with small particles is reflecting the
solar radiation entering the atmosphere.
This is known as **Albedo effect.** So it
reduces the temperature (cooling) limits,
photosynthesis and respiration. The
sulphur compounds are responsible for
**acid rain** due to acidification of rain water
and destroy the ozone.

{{< /box >}}

**Effects of wind**

*  Wind is an important factor for the
formation of rain

*  Causes wave formation in lakes and ocean,
promotes aeration of water

*  Strong wind causes soil erosion and reduces
soil fertility

*  Increases the rate of transpiration

* Helps in pollination in anemophilous plants

* It also helps in dispersal of many
fruits, seeds, spores, etc.


* Strong wind may cause up-rooting of big trees


*  Unidirectional wind stimulates the
development of flag forms in trees.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic8.png )

**e. Fire**

Fire is an exothermic factor caused due to the
chemical process of combustion, releasing heat
and light. It is mostly man-made and sometimes develops naturally due to the friction
between the tree surfaces. Fire is generally
divided into

1. Ground fire – Which is flameless and
subterranean.

2. Surface fire – Which consumes the herbs
and shrubs.

3. Crown fire – Which burns the forest canopy.
Effects of fire

* Fire has a dir ect lethal effect on plants

*  Burning scars are the suitable places for the
entry of parasitic fungi and insects

*  It brings out the alteration of light, rainfall,
nutrient cycle, fertility of soil, pH, soil flora
and fauna

*  Some fungi which grow in soil of burnt areas
called pyrophilous.
*Example: Pyronema confluens*

**Indicators of fire** – *Pteris* ( fern ) and
*Pyronema*(fungus) indicates the burnt up
and fire disturbed areas. So they are called
indicators of fire.


**Fire break**– It is a gap made in the vegetation
that acts as a barrier to slow down or stop the
progress of fire.


**A natural fire break**may occur when there
is a lack of vegetation such as River, lake and
canyon found in between vegetation may act
as a natural fire break.


**Rhytidome:** It is the structural defense by
plants against fire .The outer bark of trees
which extends to the last formed periderm is
called Rhytidome. It is composed of multiple
layers of suberized periderm, cortical and
phloem tissues. It protects the stem against
fire , water loss, invasion of insects and
prevents infections by microorganisms.


#### <u> 6.2.2 Edaphic factors </u>

Edaphic factors, the abiotic factors related
to soil, include the physical and chemical
composition of the soil formed in a particular
area. The study of soils is called Pedology.

**The soil**

Soil is the weathered superficial layer of the
Earth in which plants can grow. It is a complex
composite mass consisting of soil constituents,
soil water, soil air and soil organisms, etc.

**Soil formation**


Soil originates from rocks and develops gradually
at different rates, depending upon the ecological
and climatic conditions. Soil formation is
initiated by the weathering process. Biological
weathering takes place when organisms like
bacteria, fungi, lichens and plants help in the
breakdown of rocks through the production of
acids and certain chemical substances. 

**Soil types**

Based on soil formation (pedogenesis),
the soils are divided into

**1. Residual soils** –These are soils formed by
weathering and pedogenesis of the rock.

**2. Transported soils** – These are transported
by various agencies.

The important edaphic factors which affect
vegetation are as follows:

**1. Soil moisture:** Plants absorbs rain water
and moisture directly from the air

**2. Soil water:** Soil water is more important
than any other ecological factors affecting the
distribution of plants. Rain is the main source
of soil water. Capillary water held between
pore spaces of soil particles and angles
between them is the most important form of
water available to the plants.

**3. Soil reactions:** Soil may be acidic or
alkaline or neutral in their reaction. pH value
of the soil solution determines the availability
of plant nutrients. The best pH range of the soil
for cultivation of crop plants is **5.5 to 6.8.**


**4. Soil nutrients:**Soil fertility and productivity
is the ability of soil to provide all essential
plant nutrients such as minerals and organic
nutrients in the form of ions.


**5. Soil temperature:** Soil temperature of an
area plays an important role in determining
the geographical distribution of plants. Low
temperature reduces use of water and solute
absorption by roots.


**6. Soil atmosphere:** The spaces left between
soil particles are called pore spaces which
contains oxygen and carbon-di-oxide.

**7. Soil organisms:** Many organisms existing
in the soil like bacteria, fungi, algae,
protozoans, nematodes,
insects, earthworms, etc. are
called soil organisms. 

![Figure 6.7: Soil Profile](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic9.png )

**Soil Profile**

Soil is commonly stratified into horizons at
different depth. These layers differ in their
physical, chemical and biological properties.
This succession of super-imposed horizons is
called soil profile.

**Types of soil particles**

Based on the relative proportion of soil particles,
four types of soil are recognized.

![Table 6.3: Types of soil particles](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic10.png )

**Loamy soil is ideal soil for cultivation.** It
consists of 70% sand and 30% clay or silt or both.
It ensures good retention and proper drainage
of water. The porosity of soil provides adequate
aeration and allows the penetration of roots.

Based on the water retention, aeration and
mineral contents of soil, the distribution of
vegetation is divided into following types.

**1. Halophytes:** Plants living in saline soils

**2. Psammophytes:** Plants living in sandy soils

**3. Lithophytes:** Plants living on rocky surface

**4. Chasmophytes:** Plants living in rocky crevices

**5. Cryptophytes:**Plants living below the soil surface

**6. Cryophytes:**Plants living on surface of ice

**7. Oxylophytes:** Plants living in acidic soil

**8. Calciphytes:** Plants living in calcium rich
alkaline soil.

**Holard** – Total soil water content

**Chresard**–Water available to plants

**Echard** – Water not available to plants

**6.2.3 Topographic factors**


The surface features of earth are called
**topography.** Topographic influence on the
climate of any area is determined by the
interaction of solar radiation, temperature,
humidity, rainfall, latitude and altitude. It affects
the vegetation through climatic variations in
small areas (micro climate ) and even changes
the soil conditions. Topographic factors include
latitude, altitude, direction of mountain,
steepness of mountain etc.

**a. Latitudes and altitudes**

Latitudes represent distance from the equator.
Temperature values are maximum at the equator
and decrease gradually towards poles. Different
types of vegetation occur from equator to poles
which are illustrated below.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic11.png )

Height above the sea level forms the
**altitude.**At high altitudes, the velocity of wind
remains high, temperature and air pressure
decrease while humidity and intensity of light
increases. Due to these factors, vegetation at
different altitudes varies, showing distinct
zonation.

**b. Direction of Mountain**

North and south faces of mountain or hill possess
different types of flora and fauna because they
differ in their humidity, rainfall, light intensity,
light duration and temperature regions.

**Ecotone -** The transition zone between two
ecosystems. Example: The border between
forest and grassland.

**Edge effect –** Spices found in ecotone areas
are unique due to the effect of the two
habitats. This is called edge effect. Example:
Owl in the ecotone area between forest and
grassland.

The two faces of the mountain or hill receive
different amount of solar radiation, wind action
and rain. Of these two faces, the windward region
possesses good vegetation due to heavy rains and
the leeward region possesses poor vegetation due
to rain shadows (rain deficit).

Similarly in the soil of aquatic bodies like
ponds the center and edge possess different
depth of water due to soil slope and different
wave actions in the water body. Therefore,
different parts of the same area may possess
different species of organisms.

**c. Steepness of the mountain**

The steepness of the mountain or hill allows
the rain to run off. As a result the loss of water
causes water deficit and quick erosion of the top
soil resulting in poor vegetation. On the other
hand, the plains and valley are rich in vegetation
due to the slow drain of surface water and better
retention of water in the soil.

![](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic12.png )

#### <u> 6.2.4 Biotic factors  </u> 

The interactions among living organisms
such as plants and animals are called **biotic**
**factors**, which may cause marked effects upon
vegetation. The effects may be direct and indirect
and modifies the environment. The plants
mostly which lives together in a community
and influence one another. Similarly, animals in
association with plants also affect the plant life
in one or several ways. The different interactions
among them can be classified into following two
types they are positive interaction and negative
interaction

**Positive interactions**

When one or both the participating species are
benefited, it is positive interaction. Examples;
Mutualism and Commensalism.

**a. Mutualism:** It is an interaction between
two species of organisms in which both are
benefitted from the obligate association. The
following are common examples of mutualism.

**Nitrogen fixation**

**Rhizobium**(Bacterium) forms nodules in the
roots of leguminous plants and lives symbiotically.
The Rhizobium obtains food from leguminous
plant and in turn fixes atmospheric nitrogen into
nitrate, making it available to host plants.

![Table 6.4: Different interactions of plant](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic13.png )

**Other examples:**


* Water fern
(Azolla) and
Nitrogen fixing
Cyanobacterium
(Anabaena ).

* Anab a e n a
present in
c o r a l l o i d
roots of Cycas.
(Gymnosperm)

* Cyanobacterium (Nostoc) found in the
thalloid body of Anthoceros.(Bryophytes)

* Wasps present in fruits of fig.

* Lichen is a mutual association of an alga
and a fungus.

* Roots of terrestrial plants and fungal
hyphae- Mycorrhiza

**b. Commensalism:**It is an interaction between
two organisms in which one is benefitted and
the other is neither benefitted nor harmed.
The species that derives benefit is called the
**commensal**, while the other species is called the
host. The common examples of commensalism
are listed below:

![Figure 6.10: A nodulated legume plant root with bacteria](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic14.png )



**Epiphytes**

The plants
which are found
growing on
other plants
without harming
them are called
epiphytes. They
are commonly
found in tropical
rain forest.

![Figure 6.11: An epiphytic plant-Vanda](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic15.png )

The epiphytic higher plant **(Orchid)** gets
its nutrients and water from the atmosphere
with the help of the hygroscopic roots which
contain special type of spongy tissue called
**Velamen.** It prepares its own food and does
not depend on the host. Using the host plant
only they support and does not harm it in any
way.

* Many orchids, ferns, lianas, hanging mosses,
Peperomia, money plant and Usnea (Lichen)
are some of the examples of epiphytes.

*  Spanish Moss –Tillandsia grows on the bark
of Oak and Pine trees.

{{< box title="Do You Know" type="objective" >}}

**Proto Cooperation**

An interaction between
organisms of different
species in which both
organisms benefit but neither is dependent
on the relationship. Example: Soil bacteria /
fungi and plants growing in the soil.

{{< /box >}}



**Negative interactions**

When one of the interacting species is benefitted
and the other is harmed, it is called negative
interaction . Examples: predation, parasitism,
competition and amensalism.

**a. Predation:** It is an interaction between two
species, one of which captures, kills and eats
up the other. The species which kills is called
a **predator** and the species which is killed is
called a **prey.** The predator is benefitted while
the prey is harmed.

**Examples:**

*  A number of
plants like Drosera
(Sun dew Plant),
Nepenthes (Pitcher
Plant), Dionaea
(Venus fly trap),
Utricularia (Bladder
wort) and Sarracenia
are predators which
consume insects and
other small animals
for their food as a source of nitrogen. They
are also called as **insectivorous plants.**

![Figure 6.12: Pitcher plant – with insect](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic16.png )

*  Many herbivores are predators. Cattles,
Camels, Goats etc., frequently browse on
the tender shoots of herbs, shrubs and
trees. Generally annuals suffer more than
the perennials. Grazing and browsing may
cause remarkable changes in vegetation.
Nearly 25 percent of all insects are known
as phytophagous(feeds on plant sap and
other parts of plant)

![Figure 6.13: Insectivorous plant Utricularia](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic17.png )

*  Many defense mechanisms are evolved to
avoid their predations by plants. Examples:
Calotropis produces highly poisonous cardiac
glycosides, Tobacco produces nicotine, coffee
plants produce caffeine, Cinchona plant
produces quinine. Thorns of Bougainvillea,
spines of Opuntia, and latex of cacti also
protect them from predators.

**b. Parasitism:** It is an interaction between two
different species in which the smaller partner
(parasite) obtains food from the larger partner
(host or plant). So the parasitic species is
benefited while the host species is harmed. Based
on the host-parasite relationship, parasitism is
classified into two types they are holoparasite
and hemiparasite.

**Holoparasites**

The organisms which are dependent upon the
host plants for their entire nutrition are called
**Holoparasites.** They are also called **total parasites**.

![Figure 6.14: a) Holoparasite – Cuscuta b) A Partial stem parasite – Viscum c) Root parasite on the brinjal root Orobanche spp. ](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic18.png )
