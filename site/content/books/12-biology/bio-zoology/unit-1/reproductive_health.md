**Learning objectives**

➢ Understands the importance of sex
education and reproductive health.

➢ Learns the importance of amniocentesis as
a pre-natal diagnosis.

➢ Evaluates the effects of
maternal and infant
mortality.

➢ Identifies, compares and
explains different types of
contraceptive devices.

➢ Discusses the medical necessity and social
consequences of MTP.

➢ Explains the reasons of transmission and
prevention of STDs.

➢ Highlights the reasons of infertility.

➢ Develops a positive and healthy attitude
towards reproductive life.

Reproductive health represents a society with
people having physically and functionally
normal reproductive organs. Healthy people
have healthier babies and are able to care for
their family, and contribute more to the society
and community. Hence, health is a community
issue. Reproductive system is a complex system
controlled by the neuro-endocrine system,
hence, it is important to take necessary steps to
protect it from infectious diseases and injury.

**3.1. Need for reproductive health- Problems and strategies**

India is amongst the first few countries
in the world to initiate the ‘Family planning
programme’ since 1951 and is periodically
assessed every decade. These programmes are
popularly named as ‘Reproductive and Child
Health Care (RCH). Major tasks carried out
under these programmes are:

• Creating awareness and providing medical
assistance to build a healthy society.

• Introducing sex education in schools to
provide information about adolescence and
adolescence related changes.

• Educating couples and those in the
marriageable age groups about the
available birth control methods and
family planning norms.

{{< box title=" DID YOU KNOW" type="objective">}}

Globally, about 800 women
die every day of preventable
causes related to pregnancy
and childbirth; 20 per cent of these
women are from India. Similarly India's
infant mortality rate was 44 per 1,000 live.
Although, India has witnessed dramatic
growth over the last two decades,
maternal mortality still remains high
as in comparison to many developing
nations.

{{< /box >}}

• Creating awareness about care for pregnant
women, post-natal care of mother and child
and the importance of breast feeding.

• Encouraging and supporting
governmental and non-governmental
agencies to identify new methods and/or
to improve upon the existing methods of
birth control.

{{< box title="" type="">}}
Health care programmes such as
massive child immunization, supply of
nutritional food to the pregnant women,
Janani Suraksha Yojana, Janani Shishu
Suraksha Karyakaram, RMNCH+A
approach (an integrated approach for
reproductive, maternal, new born, child
and adolescent health), Pradhan Mantri
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan, etc., are
taken up at the national level by the
Government of India.
{{< /box >}}

**3.2. Amniocentesis and its statutory ban**

Due to small family norms and the skewed
choice for a male child, female population is
decreasing at an alarming rate. Amniocentesis
is a prenatal technique used to detect any
chromosomal abnormalities in the foetus and it
is being often misused to determine the sex of the foetus. Once the sex of the foetus is known,
there may be a chance of female foeticide.Hence,
a statutory ban on amniocentesis is imposed.

**3.3. Social impact of sex ratio, female foeticide and infanticide**

The sex ratio is the ratio of males to the
females in a population. In India, the child sex
ratio has decreased over the decade from 927
to 919 female for every 1000 males. To correct
this ratio, steps are needed to change the mind
set and attitudes of people, especially in the
young adults. Female foeticide and infanticide
is the manifestation of gender discrimination
in our society.
Female foeticide refers to ‘aborting the
female in the mother’s womb’; whereas female
infanticide is ‘killing the female child after her
birth’. These have resulted in imbalance in sex
ratio. In UNDP’s GII 2018 (United nations
developmental programmes gender inequality
index) reflected that India was ranked at 135
out of 187 countries due to availability of
very few economic opportunities to women
as compared to men.
In order to prevent female foeticide
and infanticide, Government of India has
taken various steps like PCPNDT Act
(Preconception and Prenatal diagnostic
technique act-1994) enacted to ban the
identification of sex and to prevent the
use of prenatal diagnostic techniques for
selective abortion. Various measures are
taken by the Government to ensure survival,
provision of better nutrition, education,
protection and empowerment of girls by
eliminating the differences in the sex ratio,
infant mortality rate and improving their
nutritional and educational status. POCSO
Act (Prevention of children from sexual
offences), Sexual harassment at workplace
(Prevention, prohibition and redressal) Act
and the changes in the Criminal law based on the recommendations of Justice Verma
Committee, 2013 aims at creating a safe and
secure environment for both females and
males.

**3.4. Population explosion and birth control**

Increased health facilities and better living
conditions have enhanced longevity. According
to a recent report from the UN, India’s
population has already reached 1.26 billion
and is expected to become the largest country
in population size, surpassing China around
2022. To overcome the problem of population
explosion, birth control is the only available
solution. People should be motivated to have
smaller families by using various contraceptive
devices. Advertisements by the Government
in the media as well as posters/bills, etc.,
with a slogan Naam iruvar namakku iruvar
(we two, ours two) and Naam iruvar namakku
oruvar (we two, ours one) have also motivated
to control population growth in Tamilnadu.
Statutory rising of marriageable age of the
female to 18 years and that of males to
21 years and incentives given to couples
with small families are the other measures
taken to control population growth in
our country.

**Birth control methods**

The voluntary use of contraceptive
procedures to prevent fertilization or prevent
implantation of a fertilized egg in the
uterus is termed as birth control. An ideal
contraceptive should be user friendly, easily
available, with least side effects and should not
interfere with sexual drive. The contraceptive
methods are of two types – temporary and
permanent. Natural, chemical, mechanical
and hormonal barrier methods are the
temporary birth control methods.

1. Natural methodis used to prevent meeting
of sperm with ovum. i.e., Rhythm method
(safe period), coitus interruptus, continuous
abstinence and lactational amenorrhoea.
a. Periodic abstinence/rhythm method
Ovulation occurs at about the 14th day
of the menstrual cycle. Ovum survives
for about two days and sperm remains
alive for about 72 hours in the female
reproductive tract. Coitus is to be avoided
during this time.
b. Continuous abstinence is the simplest
and most reliable way to avoid pregnancy
is not to have coitus for a defined period
that facilitates conception.
c. Coitus interruptus is the oldest family
planning method. The male partner
withdraws his penis before ejaculation,
thereby preventing deposition of semen
into the vagina.
d. Lactational amenorrhoea Menstrual
cycles resume as early as 6 to 8 weeks from
parturition. However, the reappearance
of normal ovarian cycles may be
delayed for six months during breast-
feeding. This delay in ovarian cycles is
called lactational amenorrhoea. It serves
as a natural, but an unreliable form of
birth control. Suckling by the baby during
breast-feeding stimulates the pituitary
to secrete increased prolactin hormone
in order to increase milk production.
This high prolactin concentration in the
mother’s blood may prevent menstrual
cycle by suppressing the release of GnRH
(Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone)
from hypothalamus and gonadotropin
secretion from the pituitary.

2. Barrier methods In these methods, the
ovum and sperm are prevented from meeting
so that fertilization does not occur.
a. Chemical barrier Foaming tablets,
melting suppositories, jellies and creams
are used as chemical agents that inactivate
the sperms in the vagina.
b. Mechanical barrier Condoms are a
thin sheath used to cover the penis in male whereas in female it is used to cover
vagina and cervix just before coitus so as to
prevent the entry of ejaculated semen into
the female reproductive tract. This can
prevent conception. Condoms should be
discarded after a single use. Condom also
safeguards the user from AIDS and STDs.
Condoms are made of polyurethane, latex
and lambskin.
Diaphragms, cervical caps and vaults
are made of rubber and are inserted into
the female reproductive tract to cover the
cervix before coitus in order to prevent
the sperms from entering the uterus.

c. Hormonal barrier:

It prevents the ovaries from releasing the
ova and thickens the cervical fluid which
keeps the sperm away from ovum.
Oral contraceptives — Pills are used
to prevent ovulation by inhibiting the
secretion of FSH and LH hormones. A
combined pill is the most commonly
used birth control pill. It contains
synthetic progesterone and estrogen
hormones. Saheli, contraceptive pill
by Central Drug Research Institute
(CDRI) in Lucknow, India contains
a non-steroidal preparation called
Centchroman.

d. Intrauterine Devices (IUDs):

Intrauterine devices are inserted by
medical experts in the uterus through
the vagina. These devices are available as
copper releasing IUDs, hormone releasing
IUDs and non-medicated IUDs. IUDs
increase phagocytosis of sperm within the
uterus. IUDs are the ideal contraceptives
for females who want to delay pregnancy.
It is one of the popular methods of
contraception in India and has a success
rate of 95 to 99%.
Copper releasing IUDs differ from each
other by the amount of copper. Copper IUDs such as Cu T-380 A, Nova T, Cu 7,
Cu T 380 Ag, Multiload 375, etc. release
free copper and copper salts into the
uterus and suppress sperm motility. They
can remain in the uterus for five to ten
years.
Hormone-releasing IUDs such as
Progestasert and LNG – 20 are often
called as intrauterine systems (IUS).
They increase the viscosity of the cervical
mucus and thereby prevent sperms from
entering the cervix.
Non-medicated IUDs are made of plastic
or stainless steel. Lippes loop is a double
S-shaped plastic device.

3.Permanent birth control methods are adopted by the individuals who do not want
to have any more children.

Surgical sterilisation methods are the
permanent contraception methods advised for
male and female partners to prevent any more
pregnancies. It blocks the transport of the
gametes and prevents conception. Tubectomy
is the surgical sterilisation in women. In this
procedure, a small portion of both fallopian
tubes are cut and tied up through a small
incision in the abdomen or through vagina.
This prevents fertilization as well as the entry
of the egg into the uterus. Vasectomy is the
surgical procedure for male sterilisation. In
this procedure, both vas deferens are cut and
tied through a small incision on the scrotum
to prevent the entry of sperm into the urethra.
Vasectomy prevents sperm from heading off
to penis as the discharge has no sperms in it.

**3.5. Medical termination of pregnancy (MTP)**

Medical method of abortion is a
voluntary or intentional termination of
pregnancy in a non-surgical or non-invasive
way. Early medical termination is extremely
safe upto 12 weeks (the first trimester) of


{{< box title="CASE STUDY" type="objective">}}
Approximately half of unintended pregnancies are due to contraceptive
failure, largely owing to inconsistent or incorrect use of contraceptive
methods. The effectiveness of long-acting reversible contraception
(intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants) is superior to that of contraceptive pills,
patch, or ring and is not altered in adolescents and young women. Educating young women
about the usage of intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants would dramatically
reduce the number of unintended pregnancies among women seeking family planning.
{{< /box >}}


pregnancy and generally has no impact on a
women’s fertility. Abortion during the second
trimester is more risky as the foetus becomes
intimately associated with the maternal
tissue. Government of India legalized MTP
in 1971 for medical necessity and social
consequences with certain restrictions like sex
discrimination and illegal female foeticides
to avoid its misuse. MTP performed illegally
by unqualified quacks is unsafe and could be
fatal. MTP of the first conception may have
serious psychological consequences 

**3.6. Sexually transmitted diseases (STD)**

Sexually transmitted
diseases (STD) or
Venereal diseases (VD) or
Reproductive tract infections
(RTI) are called as Sexually
transmitted infections (STI). Normally STI
are transmitted from person to person during
intimate sexual contact with an infected partner.
Infections like Hepatitis-B and HIV are
transmitted sexually as well as by sharing

{{< box title=" DID YOU KNOW" type="objective">}}
According to World Health
Organization (WHO), 2017
more than one million people
globally acquires a sexually
transmitted infection every day. India has the
third largest HIV epidemic in the world, with 2.1 million people living with HIV.
{{< /box >}}


of infusion needles, surgical instruments,
etc with infected people, blood transfusion
or from infected mother to baby. People in
the age of 15 to 24 years are prone to these
infections. The bacterial STI are gonorrhoea,
syphilis, chancroid, chlamydiasis and
lymphogranuloma venereum. The viral
STI are genital herpes, genital warts,
Hepatitis-B and AIDS. Trichomoniasis is a
protozoan STI, and candidiasis is a fungal STI.
STI caused by bacteria, fungi and protozoa
or parasites, can be treated with antibiotics
or other medicines, whereas STI caused by
virus cannot be treated but the symptoms
can be controlled by antiviral medications.
Latex condoms usage greatly reduces the risk,
but does not completely eliminate the risk of
transmission of STI.

**Prevention of STDs**

    a. Avoid sex with unknown partner/multiple partners.
    b. Use condoms.
    c. In case of doubt, consult a doctor for
    diagnosis and get complete treatment.

{{< box title=" DID YOU KNOW" type="objective">}}
TNHSP (Tamilnadu health
systems project), a unit
of the Health and family
welfare department of the
Government of Tamilnadu
does free screening for cervical and
breast cancer.

**Cervical cancer**

Cervical cancer is caused by a sexually
transmitted virus called Human Papilloma
virus (HPV). HPV may cause abnormal
growth of cervical cells or cervical dysplasia.
The most common symptoms and signs of
cervical cancer are pelvic pain, increased vaginal
discharge and abnormal vaginal bleeding. The
risk factors for cervical cancer include
1. Having multiple sexual partners
2. Prolonged use of contraceptive pills
Cervical cancer can be diagnosed by a
Papanicolaou smear (PAP smear) combined with
an HPV test. X-Ray, CT scan, MRI and a PET scan
may also be used to determine the stage of cancer.
The treatment options for cervical cancer include
radiation therapy, surgery and chemotherapy.
Modern screening techniques can detect
precancerous changes in the cervix. Therefore
screening is recommended for women above
30 years once in a year. Cervical cancer can
be prevented with vaccination. Primary
prevention begins with HPV vaccination of
girls aged 9 – 13 years, before they become
sexually active. Modification in lifestyle can
also help in preventing cervical cancer. Healthy
diet, avoiding tobacco usage, preventing early
marriages, practicing monogamy and regular
exercise minimize the risk of cervical cancer.

**3.7. Infertility**

Inability to conceive or produce children
even after unprotected sexual cohabitation
is called infertility. That is, the inability of a
man to produce sufficient numbers or quality
of sperm to impregnate a woman or inability
of a woman to become pregnant or maintain
a pregnancy.

The causes for infertility are tumours
formed in the pituitary or reproductive organs,
inherited mutations of genes responsible for the
biosynthesis of sex hormones, malformation
of the cervix or fallopian tubes and inadequate
nutrition before adulthood. Long-term stress
damages many aspects of health especially
the menstrual cycle. Ingestion of toxins
(heavy metal cadmium), heavy use of alcohol,
tobacco and marijuana, injuries to the gonads
and aging also cause infertility.

**Other causes of infertility**

• Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), uterine
fibroids and endometriosis are the most
common causes of infertility in women.

• Low body fat or anorexia in women. i.e. a
psychiatric eating disorder characterised
by the fear of gaining weight.

• Undescended testes and swollen veins
(varicocoele) in scrotum.

• Tight clothing in men may raise the
temperature in the scrotum and affect
sperm production.

• Under developed ovaries or testes.

• Female may develop antibodies against
her partner's sperm.

• Males may develop an autoimmune
response to their own sperm.

{{< box title="" type="objective">}}
All women are born with ovaries, but some
do not have functional uterus. This condition
is called Mayer-Rokitansky syndrome.
{{< /box >}}


**3.8. Assisted reproductive technology (ART)**

A collection of procedures,
which includes the handling
of gametes and/or embryos
outside the body to achieve
pregnancy is known as Assisted
Reproductive Technology.
It increases the chance of pregnancy in infertile
couples. ART includesintra-uterine insemination
(IUI), in vitro fertilization, (IVF) Embryo
transfer (ET), Zygote intra-fallopian transfer
(ZIFT), Gamete intrafallopian transfer(GIFT),
Intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection(ICSI),
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis, oocyte and
sperm donation and surrogacy.

**Intra-uterine insemination (IUI)**

This is a procedure to treat infertile men
with low sperm count. The semen is collected
either from the husband or from a healthy
donor and is introduced into the uterus through
the vagina by a catheter after stimulating the
ovaries to produce more ova. The sperms swim
towards the fallopian tubes to fertilize the egg,
resulting in normal pregnancy.

**In vitro fertilization (IVF) or Test tube baby**

In this technique, sperm and eggs
are allowed to unite outside the body in a
laboratory. One or more fertilized eggs may be transferred into the woman’s uterus, where they
may implant in the uterine lining and develop.
Excess embryos may be cryopreserved (frozen)
for future use. Initially, IVF was used to treat
women with blocked, damaged, or absent
fallopian tubes. Today, IVF is used to treat
many causes of infertility. The basic steps in an
IVF treatment cycle are ovarian stimulation,
egg retrieval, fertilization, embryo culture, and
embryo transfer.
Egg retrieval is done by minor
surgery under general anesthesia, using
ultrasound guide after 34 to 37 hours of hCG
(human chorionic gonadotropin) injection.
The eggs are prepared and stripped
from the surrounding cells. At the same
time, sperm preparation is done using
a special media. After preparing the
sperms, the eggs are brought together.
10,000-1,00,000 motile sperms are needed for
each egg. Then the zygote is allowed to divide to
form 8 celled blastomere and then transferred
into the uterus for a successful pregnancy.
The transfer of an embryo with more than
8 blastomeres stage into uterus is called
Embryo transfer technique.

{{< box title=" DID YOU KNOW" type="objective">}}

**Cryopreservation**

(or freezing) of embryos
is often used when there
are more embryos than
needed for a single IVF
transfer. Embryo cryopreservation can
provide an additional opportunity for
pregnancy, through a Frozen embryo
transfer (FET), without undergoing
another ovarian stimulation and retrieval.
{{< /box >}}
**Zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT)**

As in IVF, the zygote upto 8 blastomere
stage is transferred to the fallopian tube by
laparoscopy. The zygote continues its natural
divisions and migrates towards the uterus
where it gets implanted.
Intra uterine transfer (IUT)
Embryo with more than 8 blastomeres
is inserted into uterus to complete its further
development.

**Gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT)**

Transfer of an ovum collected from a
donor into the fallopian tube. In this the eggs
are collected from the ovaries and placed
with the sperms in one of the fallopian tubes.
The zygote travels toward the uterus and gets
implanted in the inner lining of the uterus.
Intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)
In this method only one sperm is injected
into the focal point of the egg to fertilize. The
sperm is carefully injected into the cytoplasm
of the egg. Fertilization occurs in 75 - 85%
of eggs injected with the sperms. The zygote
is allowed to divide to form an 8 celled
blastomere and then transferred to the uterus
to develop a protective pregnancy.

**Surrogacy**

Surrogacy is a method of assisted
reproduction or agreement whereby a woman
agrees to carry a pregnancy for another person,
who will become the newborn child's parent
after birth. Through in vitro fertilization (IVF),
embryos are created in a lab and are transferred
into the surrogate mother's uterus.

**Male infertility**

Azoospermia is defined as the absence of
spermatozoa in the ejaculate semen on atleast
two occasions and is observed approximately
in 1% of the population.
Micro-testicular sperm extraction (TESE)
Microsurgical sperm retrieval from the testicle
involves a small midline incision in the scrotum,
through which one or both testicles can be seen.
Under the microscope, the seminiferous tubules
are dilated and small amount of testicular tissue
in areas of active sperm production are removed
and improved for sperm yield compared to
traditional biopsy techniques.

**3.9. Detection of foetal disorders during early pregnancy**

**Ultrasound scanning**

Ultrasound has no known risks other
than mild discomfort due to pressure from
the transducer on the abdomen or vagina.
No radiation is used during this procedure.
Ultrasonography is usually performed in the
first trimester for dating, determination of
the number of foetuses, and for assessment
of early pregnancy complications.

{{< box title="" type="">}}
There are several types of ultrasound
imaging techniques. As the most common
type, the 2-D ultrasound provides a flat
picture of one aspect of the baby. The 3-D
image allows the health care provider to see
the width, height and depth of the images,
which can be helpful during the diagnosis.
The latest technology is 4-D ultrasound,
which allows the health care provider to
visualize the unborn baby moving in real
time with a three-dimensional image.
{{< /box >}}


**Amniocentesis**

Amniocentesis involves taking a small
sample of the amniotic fluid that surrounds
the foetus to diagnose for chromosomal
abnormalities (Fig. 3.1).

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf30.png )

Amniocentesis is generally performed
in a pregnant woman between the 15th and
20th weeks of pregnancy by inserting a long,
thin needle through the abdomen into the
amniotic sac to withdraw a small sample of
amniotic fluid. The amniotic fluid contains
cells shed from the foetus.

**Chorionic villus sampling (CVS)**

CVS is a prenatal test that involves taking
a sample of the placental tissue to test for
chromosomal abnormalities.

**Foetoscope**

Foetoscope is used to monitor the foetal
heart rate and other functions during late
pregnancy and labour. The average foetal heart
rate is between 120 and 160 beats per minute.
An abnormal foetal heart rate or pattern may
mean that the foetus is not getting enough
oxygen and it indicates other problems.

A hand-held doppler device is often used
during prenatal visits to count the foetal heart
rate. During labour, continuous electronic
foetal monitoring is often used.

**Summary**

Reproductive health refers to a total well-
being in all aspects of reproduction. Providing
medical facilities and care to the problems like
menstrual irregularities, pregnancy related
aspects, medical termination of pregnancy, STI,
birth control, infertility, post natal child and
maternal management are the important aspect
of the Reproductive and Child Health Care
programmes.
An overall improvement in reproductive
health has taken place in our country as indicated
by reduced maternal and infant mortality rates,
assistance to infertile couples, etc. Improved health
facilities and better living conditions promote an
explosive growth of population. Such a growth
necessitated intense propagation of contraceptive
methods. Various contraceptive options are
available now such as natural, traditional, barrier,
IUDs, pills, injectables, implants and surgical
methods. Though contraceptives are not regular requirements for reproductive health, one is
adviced to use them to avoid pregnancy or to
delay or space pregnancy.
Diseases or infections transmitted through
coitus are called Sexually transmitted infections
(STIs). Pelvic inflammatory diseases (PIDs), still
birth, infertility are some of the complications
of STDs. Early detection facilitates better cure of
these diseases. Avoiding coitus with unknown/
multiple partners, use of condoms during coitus
are some of the simple precautions to avoid
contracting STIs.
Inability to conceive or produce children even
after unprotected sexual cohabitation is called
infertility. Various methods are now available to
help such couples. In vitro fertilization followed by
transfer of embryo into the female genital tract is
one such method.
