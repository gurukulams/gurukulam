Every organ system in the human
body works continuously to maintain
homeostasis for the survival of the individual.
The human reproductive system is essential for
the survival of the species. An individual may
live a long healthy life without producing an
offspring, but reproduction is inevitable for the
existence of a species.
The reproductive system has four
main functions namely,
• to produce the gametes namely
sperms and ova
• to transport and sustain these gametes
• to nurture the developing offspring
• to produce hormones
The major reproductive events in human
beings are as follows:
• Gametogenesis: Formation of gametes by
spermatogenesis and oogenesis.
• Insemination: Transfer of sperms by the
male into the female genital tract.
• Fertilization: Fusion of male and
female gametes to form zygote, called
Fertilization.
• Cleavage: Rapid mitotic divisions of
the zygote which convert the single celled  zygote into a multicellular structure
called blastocyst.
• Implantation: Attachment of blastocyst
to the uterine wall.
• Placentation: Formation of placenta
which is the intimate connection between
foetus and uterine wall of the mother for
exchange of nutrients.
• Gastrulation: Process by which
blastocyst is changed into a gastrula with
three primary germ layers.
• Organogenesis: Formation of specific
tissues, organs and organ systems from
three germ layers.
• Parturition: Expulsion of the foetus from
the mother’s womb.
These functions are carried out by the
primary and accessory reproductive organs.
The primary reproductive organs namely
the ovary and testis are responsible for
producing the ova and sperms respectively.
Hormones secreted by the pituitary gland and
the gonads help in the development of the
secondary sexual characteristics, maturation
of the reproductive system and regulation
of normal functioning of the reproductive
system. The accessory organs help in
transport and to sustain the gametes and to
nurture the developing offspring.


**2.1 Human reproductive system**

The male reproductive system comprises
of a pair of testes, accessory ducts, glands and
external genitalia (Fig. 2.1).
Testes are the primary male sex organs.
They are a pair of ovoid bodies lying in the
scrotum (Fig.2.2 a). The scrotum is a sac of
skin that hangs outside the abdominal cavity.
Since viable sperms cannot be produced
at normal body temperature, the scrotum
is placed outside the abdominal cavity to
provide a temperature 2-3o

C lower than the
normal internal body temperature. Thus,
the scrotum acts as a thermoregulator for
spermatogenesis.
Each testis is covered by an outermost
fibrous tunica albuginea and is divided
by septa into about 200 - 250 lobules each
containing 2-4 highly coiled testicular
tubules or seminiferous tubules. These highly
convoluted tubules which form 80 percent of
the testicular substance are the sites for sperm
production.
The stratified epithelium of the seminiferous
tubule is made of two types of cells namely sertoli
cells or nurse cells and spermatogonic cells
or male germ cells. Sertoli cells are elongated
and pyramidal and provide nourishment to
the sperms till maturation. They also secrete
inhibin, a hormone which
is involved in the negative
feedback control of sperm
production. Spermatogonic
cells divide meiotically and
differentiate to produce
spermatozoa.
Interstitial cells or
Leydig cells are embedded
in the soft connective
tissue surrounding the
seminiferous tubules.
These cells are endocrine in nature and secret

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf11.png )

**CRYPTORCHISM** 

The failure of one or both testes to descend down into the scrotal sacs is
known as cryptorchism (crypto – hidden + orchis – testicle). It occurs in 1 – 3 percent of new born males. A surgical correction at a young age can rectify the defect, else these individuals may become sterile and are unable to produce viable sperms.


androgens namely the testosterone hormone
which initiates the process of spermatogenesis.
These cells are endocrine in nature and
are characteristic features of the testes of
mammals. Other immunologically competent
cells are also present.
The accessory ducts associated
with the male reproductive system
include rete testis, vasa efferentia,
epididymis and vas deferens
(Fig. 2.2 b). The seminiferous
tubules of each lobule converge to
form a tubulus rectus that conveys
the sperms into the rete testis. The
rete testis is a tubular network on
the posterior side of the testis. The
sperms leave the rete testis and enter
the epididymis through the vasa
efferentia. The epididymis is a single
highly coiled tube that temporarily
stores the spermatozoa and they
undergo physiological maturation
and acquire increased motility and
fertilizing capacity. The epididymis
leads to the vas deferens and joins
the duct of the seminal vesicle to
form the ejaculatory duct which
passes through the prostate and
opens into the urethra. The urethra
is the terminal portion of the male
reproductive system and is used to
convey both urine and semen at
different times. It originates from the
urinary bladder and extends through
the penis by an external opening
called urethral meatus.
The accessory glands of the
male reproductive system include the paired seminal vesicles and bulbourethral
glands also called Cowper’s gland and a single
prostate gland. The seminal vesicles secrete an
alkaline fluid called seminal plasma containing
fructose sugar, ascorbic acid, prostaglandins and

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf12.png )

a coagulating enzyme called vesiculase which
enhances sperm motility. The bulbourethral
glands are inferior to the prostate and their
secretions also help in the lubrication of the penis.
The prostate encircles the urethra and is just
below the urinary bladder and secretes a slightly
acidic fluid that contains citrate, several enzymes
and prostate specific antigens. Semen or seminal
fluid is a milky white fluid which contains
sperms and the seminal plasma (secreted from
the seminal vesicles, prostate gland and the
bulbourethal glands). The seminal fluid acts as a
transport medium, provides nutrients, contains
chemicals that protect and activate the sperms
and also facilitate their movement.
The penis is the male external genitalia
functioning as a copulatory organ. It is made
of a special tissue that helps in the erection of
penis to facilitate insemination. The enlarged
end of the penis called glans penis is covered
by a loose fold of skin called foreskin or
prepuce.
The female reproductive system is far more
complex than the male because in addition
to gamete formation, it has to nurture the
developing foetus. The female reproductive
system consists of a pair of ovaries along with
a pair of oviducts, uterus, cervix, vagina and

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf13.png )

the external genitalia located in the pelvic
region (Fig. 2.3 a). These parts along with the
mammary glands are integrated structurally and
functionally to support the process of ovulation,
Fertilization, pregnancy, child birth and child
care.
Ovaries are the primary female sex organs
that produce the female gamete, ovum. The
ovaries are located one on each side of the lower
abdomen. The ovary is an elliptical structure
about 2-4 cm long. Each ovary is covered by a
thin cuboidal epithelium called the germinal
epithelium which encloses the ovarian stroma.
The stroma is differentiated as the outer cortex and
inner medulla. Below the germinal epithelium is
a dense connective tissue, the tunica albuginea.
The cortex appears dense and granular due
to the presence of ovarian follicles in various
stages of development. The medulla is a
loose connective tissue with abundant blood
vessels, lymphatic vessels and nerve fibres.
The ovary remains attached to the pelvic
wall and the uterus by an ovarian ligament
called mesovarium.
The fallopian tubes (uterine tubes or
oviducts), uterus and vagina constitute the
female accessory organs (Fig. 2.3 b). Each
fallopian tube extends from the periphery
of each ovary to the uterus. The
proximal part of the fallopian
tube bears a funnel shaped
infundibulum. The edges of the
infundibulum have many finger
like projections called fimbriae

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/note1.png )

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf14.png )


which help in collection of the ovum after
ovulation. The infundibulum leads to a wider
central portion called ampulla. The last part
of the oviduct is the isthmus which is short
and thick walled connecting the ampulla and
infundibulum to the uterus.
The uterus or womb is a hollow, thick-walled,
muscular, highly vascular and inverted pear
shaped structure lying in the pelvic cavity
between the urinary bladder and rectum. The
major portion of the uterus is the body and the
rounded region superior to it, is the fundus. The
uterus opens into the vagina through a narrow
cervix. The cavity of the cervix called the
cervical canal communicates with the vagina
through the external orifice and with the uterus
through the internal orifice. The cervical canal
along with vagina forms the birth canal.
The wall of the uterus has three layers of
tissues. The outermost thin membranous
serous layer called the perimetrium,
the middle thick muscular layer called
myometrium and the inner glandular layer
called endometrium. The endometrium
undergoes cyclic changes during the
menstrual cycle while myometrium exhibits
strong contractions during parturition.
Vagina is a large fibromuscular tube that
extends from the cervix to the exterior. It is
the female organ of copulation. The female
reproductive structures that lie external to
the vagina are called as the external genitalia or vulva comprising
of labia majora, labia
minora, hymen and
clitoris.
The Bartholin’s glands
(also called greater
vestibular glands) are
located posterior to
the left and right of the
opening of the vagina.
They secrete mucus to
lubricate the vagina and
are homologous to the bulbourethral glands
of the male. The Skene’s glands are located
on the anterior wall of the vagina and around
the lower end of the urethra. They secrete a
lubricating fluid and are homologous to the
prostate gland of the males.
The external opening of the vagina is partially
closed by a thin ring of tissue called the hymen.
The hymen is often torn during the first coitus
(physical union). However in some women it
remains intact. It can be stretched or torn due to
a sudden fall or jolt and also during strenuous
physical activities such as cycling, horseback
riding, etc., and therefore cannot be considered
as an indicator of a woman’s virginity.
The mammary glands are modified sweat
glands present in both sexes. It is rudimentary
in the males and functional in the females. A
pair of mammary glands is located in the
thoracic region. It contains glandular tissue
and variable quantities of fat with a median
nipple surrounded by a pigmented area called
the areola. Several sebaceous glands called
the areolar glands are found on the surface
and they reduce cracking of the skin of the
nipple. Internally each mammary gland
consists of 2-25 lobes, separated by fat and
connective tissues (Fig. 2.4). Each lobe is made
up of lobules which contain acini or alveoli
lined by epithelial cells. Cells of the alveoli
secrete milk. The alveoli open into mammary
tubules. The tubules of each lobe join to form

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf15.png )

a mammary duct. Several mammary ducts
join to form a wider mammary ampulla
which is connected to the lactiferous duct in
the nipple. Under the nipple, each lactiferous
duct expands to form the lactiferous sinus
which serves as a reservoir of milk. Each
lactiferous duct opens separately by a minute
pore on the surface of the nipple.
Normal development of the breast
begins at puberty and
progresses with changes
during each menstrual
cycle. In non-pregnant
women, the glandular
structure is largely
underdeveloped and
the breast size is largely
due to amount of fat
deposits. The size of
the breast does not have
an influence on the
efficiency of lactation.

**2.2 Gametogenesis**

Gametogenesis is the process of formation
of gametes i.e., sperms and ovary from the
primary sex organs in all sexually reproducing
organisms. Meiosis plays the most significant
role in the process of gametogenesis (Fig.2.5).

**Spermatogenesis**

Spermatogenesis is the sequence of
events in the seminiferous tubules of the
testes that produce the male gametes, the
sperms. During development, the primordial
germ cells migrate into the testes and become
immature germ cells called sperm mother
cells or spermatogonia in the inner surfaces
of the seminiferous tubules (Fig. 2.6 a). The
spermatogonia begin to undergo mitotic
division at puberty and continue throughout
life.
In the first stage of spermatogenesis, the
spermatogonia migrate among sertoli cells
towards the central lumen of the seminiferous
tubule and become modified and enlarged
to form primary spermatocytes which are
diploid with 23 pairs i.e., 46 chromosomes.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf16.png )

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf17.png )

Some of the primary spermatocytes
undergo first meiotic division to form two
secondary spermatocytes which are haploid
with 23 chromosomes each. The secondary
spermatocytes undergo second meiotic
division to produce four haploid spermatids.
The spermatids are transformed into mature
spermatozoa (sperms) by the process
called spermiogenesis. Sperms are finally
released into the cavity of seminiferous
tubules by a process called spermiation.
The whole process of spermatogenesis
takes about 64 days. At any given time,
different regions of the seminiferous tubules
contain spermatocytes in different stages
of development (Fig. 2.6 b). The sperm
production remains nearly constant at a rate
of about 200 million sperms per day.
Spermatogenesis starts at the age of
puberty and is initiated due to the increase
in the release of Gonadotropin Releasing
Hormone (GnRH) by the hypothalamus.
GnRH acts on the anterior pituitary gland and
stimulates the secretion of two gonadotropins
namely Follicle Stimulating Hormone
(FSH) and Lutenizing Hormone (LH). FSH
stimulates testicular growth and enhances the
production of Androgen Binding Protein
(ABP) by the sertoli cells and helps in the
process of spermiogenesis. LH acts on the
Leydig cells and stimulates the synthesis of
testosterone which in turn stimulates the
process of spermatogenesis.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf18.png )

**Structure of human spermatozoan**

The human sperm is a microscopic,
flagellated and motile gamete (Fig. 2.7).
The whole body of the sperm is enveloped
by plasma membrane and is composed of a
head, neck and a tail. The head comprises
of two parts namely acrosome and nucleus.
Acrosome is a small cap like pointed
structure present at the tip of the nucleus
and is formed mainly from the Golgi body
of the spermatid. It contains hyaluronidase,
a proteolytic enzyme, popularly known as
sperm lysin which helps to penetrate the
ovum during Fertilization. The nucleus is flat
and oval. The neck is very short and is present
between the head and the middle piece.
It contains the proximal centriole towards
the nucleus which plays a role in the first
division of the zygote and the distal centriole
gives rise to the axial filament of the sperm.
The middle piece possesses mitochondria
spirally twisted around the axial filament
called mitochondrial spiral or nebenkern.
It produces energy in the form of ATP
molecules for the movement of sperms. The tail is the longest part
of the sperm and is
slender and tapering.
It is formed of a
central axial filament
or axoneme and an
outer protoplasmic
sheath. The lashing
movements of the
tail push the sperm
forward. The human
male ejaculates about
200 to 300 million
sperms during coitus.
It is estimated that
around 60 percent
of sperms must have
normal shape of which
at least 40 per cent
must show vigorous
motility for normal fertility.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf19.png )

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/note2.png )

**Oogenesis**

Oogenesis is the process of development
of the female gamete or ovum or egg in the
ovaries. During foetal development, certain
cells in the germinal epithelium of the foetal
ovary divide by mitosis and produce millions of
egg mother cells or oogonia. No more oogonia
are formed or added after birth. The oogonial
cells start dividing and enter into Prophase I of
meiotic division I to form the primary oocytes
which are temporarily arrested at this stage.
The primary oocytes then get surrounded by
a single layer of granulosa cells to form the
primordial or primary follicles (Fig. 2.8 a).
A large number of follicles degenerate during the
period from birth to puberty, so at puberty only
60,000 to 80,000 follicles are left in each ovary.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/note3.png )

The primary follicle gets surrounded
by many layers of granulosa cells and a new
theca layer to form the secondary follicle. A
fluid filled space, the antrum develops in the
follicle and gets transformed into a tertiary
follicle. The theca layer gets organized into an
inner theca interna and an outer theca externa.
At this time, the primary oocyte within the
tertiary follicle grows in size and completes its
first meiotic division and forms the secondary
oocyte. It is an unequal division resulting in
the formation of a large haploid secondary
oocyte and a first polar body. The first polar
body disintegrates. During Fertilization, the
secondary oocyte undergoes second meiotic
division and produces a large cell, the ovum
and a second polar body. The second polar body
also degenerates. The tertiary follicle eventually
becomes a mature follicle or Graafian follicle.
If Fertilization does not take place, second
meiotic division is never completed and the
egg disintegrates. At the end of gametogenesis
in females, each primary oocyte gives rise to
only one haploid ovum.

**Structure of ovum**

Human ovum is non-cleidoic, alecithal
and microscopic in nature. (Fig. 2.8 (b)). Its
cytoplasm called ooplasm contains a large
nucleus called the germinal vesicle. The ovum
is surrounded by three coverings namely an
inner thin transparent vitelline membrane,
middle thick zona pellucida and outer thick
coat of follicular cells called corona radiata.
Between the vitelline membrane and zona
pellucida is a narrow perivitelline space.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf20.png )

**2.3 Menstrual cycle**

The menstrual or ovarian cycle occurs
approximately once in every 28/29 days
during the reproductive life of the female from
menarche (puberty) to menopause except
during pregnancy. The cycle of events starting
from one menstrual period till the next one is
called the menstrual cycle during which cyclic
changes occurs in the endometrium every
month. Cyclic menstruation is an indicator of
normal reproductive phase (Fig. 2.9).

**Menstrual cycle comprises of the following phases**

1. Menstrual phase
2. Follicular or proliferative phase
3. Ovulatory phase
4. Luteal or secretory phase

**1. Menstrual phase**

The cycle starts with the menstrual phase
when menstrual flow occurs and lasts for 3-5
days. Menstrual flow is due to the breakdown of
endometrial lining of the uterus, and its blood
vessels due to decline in the level of progesterone
and oestrogen. Menstruation occurs only if the
released ovum is not fertilized. Absence of
menstruation may be an indicator of pregnancy.
However it could also be due to stress, hormonal
disorder and anaemia.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf21.png )

**2. Follicular or proliferative phase**

The follicular phase extends from the 5th
day of the cycle until the time of ovulation.
During this phase, the primary follicle in the
ovary grows to become a fully mature Graafian
follicle and simultaneously, the endometrium
regenerates through proliferation. These changes
in the ovary and the uterus are induced by the
secretion of gonadotropins like FSH and LH,
which increase gradually during the follicular
phase. It stimulates follicular development and
secretion of oestrogen by the follicle cells.

**3. Ovulatory phase**

Both LH and FSH attain peak level in
the middle of the cycle (about the 14th day).
Maximum secretion of LH during the mid
cycle called LH surge induces the rupture of
the Graafian follicle and the release of the ovum
(secondary oocyte) from the ovary wall into
the peritoneal cavity. This process is called
as ovulation.

**4. Luteal or secretory phase**

During luteal phase, the remaining part
of the Graafian follicle is transformed into
a transitory endocrine gland called corpus
luteum. The corpus luteum secretes large
amount of progesterone which is essential
for the maintenance of the endometrium.
If Fertilization takes place, it paves way for

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf22.png )

the implantation of the fertilized ovum. The
uterine wall secretes nutritious fluid in the
uterus for the foetus. So, this phase is also
called as secretory phase. During pregnancy
all events of menstrual cycle stop and there is
no menstruation.

In the absence of Fertilization, the corpus
luteum degenerates completely and leaves a scar
tissue called corpus albicans. It also initiates
the disintegration of the endometrium leading
to menstruation, marking the next cycle.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/note4.png )

**Menstrual hygiene**

Menstrual hygiene is vital for good
health, well-being, dignity, empowerment
and productivity of women. The impact of
poor menstrual hygiene on girls is increased
stress levels, fear and embarrassment during
menstruation. This can keep girls inactive
during such periods leading to absenteeism
from school.
Clean and safe absorbable clothing
materials, sanitary napkins, pads, tampons
and menstrual cups have been identified
as materials used to manage menstruation.
Changing sanitary material 4-5 hours as per
the requirement, provides comfort, cleanliness
and protection from infections. It also helps in
enhancing the quality of life of women during
this period. Used sanitary napkins should be
wrapped in paper and disposed. It should not
be thrown in open areas or drain pipe of toilets.
Flushing of sanitary napkins in the drain pipes
causes choking of the drainage line leading to
water pollution.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/note5.png )

**Menopause**

Menopause is the phase in a women’s
life when ovulation and menstruation stops.
The average age of menopause is 45-50 years.
It indicates the permanent cessation of the
primary functions of the ovaries.

**2.4 Fertilization and implantation**

Fertilization occurs when a haploid sperm
fuses with a haploid ovum to form a fertilized
egg or diploid zygote.

The sperms deposited in the female
reproductive tract undergo capacitation, which
is a biochemical event that enables the sperm
to penetrate and fertilise the egg. Fertilization
occurs only if the ovum and sperms are
transported simultaneously to the ampullary
isthmic junction of the fallopian tube.
Before a sperm can enter the egg,
it must penetrate the multiple layers of
granulosa (follicular) cells which are around
the ovum forming the corona radiata
(Fig. 2.10). The follicular cells are held together
by an adhesive cementing substance called
hyaluronic acid. The acrosomal membrane
disintegrates releasing the proteolytic enzyme,
hyaluronidase during sperm entry through
the corona radiata and zona pellucida. This is
called acrosomal reaction. Once Fertilization
is accomplished, cortical granules from the
cytoplasm of the ovum form a barrier called
the Fertilization membrane around the ovum
preventing further penetration of other sperms.
Thus polyspermy is prevented.
The first cleavage produces two identical
cells called blastomeres. These produce 4 cells,
then 8 and so on. After 72 hours of Fertilization,
a loose collection of cells forms a berry shaped
cluster of 16 or more cells called the morula
(Fig. 2.11).
Under the influence of progesterone,
smooth muscles of the fallopian tube relax
and the dividing embryo takes 4-5 days to
move through the fallopian tube into the
uterine cavity and finally gets implanted in
the uterine wall. At this point the embryo
consists of a fluid filled hollow ball of about
100 cells, called the blastocyst. The blastocyst
is composed of a single layer of large flattened
cells called trophoblast and a small cluster
of 20-30 rounded cells called the inner cell
mass. The inner cell mass of the blastocyst
develops into the embryo and becomes
embedded in the endometrium of the uterus.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf23.png )

This process is called implantation and it
results in pregnancy.
If the fertilized ovum is implanted outside
the uterus it results in ectopic pregnancy.
About 95 percent of ectopic pregnancies
occur in the fallopian tube. The growth of
the embryo may cause internal bleeding,
infection and in some cases even death due to
rupture of the fallopian tube.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf24.png )

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/note6.png )

**2.5 Maintenance of pregnancy**

and embryonic development
The inner cell mass in the blastula is
differentiated into epiblast and hypoblast
immediately after implantation. The hypoblast
is the embryonic endoderm and the epiblast is the ectoderm. The cells remaining in
between the epiblast and the endoderm form
the mesoderm. Thus the transformation of the
blastocyst into a gastrula with the primary germ
layers by the movement of the blastomeres is
called gastrulation. Each germ layer gives rise
to specific tissues, organs and organ systems
during organogenesis.
The extra embryonic membranes namely
the amnion, yolk sac, allantois and chorion
protect the embryo from dessication, mechanical
shock and help in the absorption of nutrients
and exchange of gases (Fig. 2.12). The amnion
is a double layered translucent membrane filled
with the amniotic fluid. It provides a buoyant
environment to protect the developing embryo
from injury, regulates the temperature of the
foetus and provides a medium in which the
foetus can move. The yolk sac forms a part of
the gut and is the source of the earliest blood
cells and blood vessels.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf25.png )

The allantois forms a small out pocketing
of embryonic tissue at the caudal end of the yolk
sac. It is the structural base for the umbilical
cord that links the embryo to the placenta and
ultimately it becomes part of the urinary bladder.
The chorion is the outermost membrane which
encloses the embryo and all other membranes
and also helps in the formation of the placenta.
The trophoblast cells in the blastocyst
send out several finger like projections called chorionic villi carrying foetal blood and are
surrounded by sinuses that contain maternal
blood. The chorionic villi and the uterine
tissues form the disc-shaped placenta. Placenta
is a temporary endocrine organ formed during
pregnancy and it connects the foetus to the
uterine wall through the umbilical cord. It is
the organ by which the nutritive, respiratory
and excretory functions are fulfilled. The
embryo’s heart develops during the fourth week
of pregnancy and circulates blood through the
umbilical cord and placenta as well as through
its own tissues.
The primary germ layers serve as the
primitive tissues from which all body organs
develop. The ectoderm gives rise to the central
nervous system (brain and spinal cord),
peripheral nervous system, epidermis and
its derivatives and mammary glands. The
connective tissue, cartilage and bone, muscles,
organs of urinogenital system (kidney, ureter
and gonads) arise from the mesoderm. The
endodermal derivatives are epithelium of
gastrointestinal and respiratory tract, liver,
pancreas, thyroid and parathyroids.
Human pregnancy lasts for about 280
days or 40 weeks and is called the gestation
period. It can be divided for convenience into
three trimesters of three months each. The first
trimester is the main period of organogenesis,
the body organs namely the heart, limbs,
lungs, liver and external genital organs are well
developed. By the end of the second trimester,
the face is well formed with features, eyelids and
eyelashes, eyes blink, body is covered with fine
hair, muscle tissue develops and bones become
harder. The foetus is fully developed and is
ready for delivery by the end of nine months
(third trimester).
During pregnancy, the placenta acts as
a temporary endocrine gland and produces
large quantities of human Chorionic
Gonadotropin (hCG), human Chorionic
Somatomammotropin (hCS) or human Placental Lactogen (hPL), oestrogens and
progesterone which are essential for a normal
pregnancy. A hormone called relaxin is also
secreted during the later phase of pregnancy
which helps in relaxation of the pelvic ligaments
at the time of parturition. It should be noted that
hCG, hPL and relaxin are produced only during
pregnancy. In addition, during pregnancy the
level of other hormones like oestrogen and
progesterone, cortisol, prolactin, thyroxine, etc.,
is increased several folds in the maternal blood.
These hormones are essential for supporting
foetal growth.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/note7.png )

**2.6 Parturition and lactation**

Parturition is the completion of pregnancy
and giving birth to the baby. The series of
events that expels the infant from the uterus
is collectively called “labour”. Throughout
pregnancy the uterus undergoes periodic
episodes of weak and strong contractions.
These contractions called Braxter-Hick’s
contractions lead to false labour. As the
pregnancy progresses, increase in the oestrogen
concentration promotes uterine contractions.
These uterine contractions facilitate moulding
of the foetus and downward movement of
the foetus. The descent of the foetus causes
dilation of cervix of the uterus and vaginal
canal resulting in a neurohumoral reflex called
Foetal ejection reflex or Ferguson reflex. This
initiates the secretion of oxytocin from the
neurohypophysis which in turn brings about
the powerful contraction of the uterine muscles
and leads to the expulsion of the baby through
the birth canal. This sequence of events is called
as parturition or childbirth.
Relaxin is a hormone secreted by the
placenta and also found in the corpus luteum.
It promotes parturition by relaxing the pelvic
joints and by dilatation of the cervix with
continued powerful contractions. The amnion
ruptures and the amniotic fluid flows out
through the vagina, followed by the foetus. The
placenta along with the remains of the umbilical
cord called “after birth” is expelled out after
delivery.
Lactation is the production of milk by
mammary glands. The mammary glands show
changes during every menstrual cycle, during
pregnancy and lactation. Increased level of
oestrogens, progesterone and human Placental
Lactogen (hPL) towards the end of pregnancy
stimulate the hypothalamus towards prolactin
– releasing factors. The anterior pituitary
responds by secreting prolactin which plays a
major role in lactogenesis.

Oxytocin causes the “Let-Down” reflex-
the actual ejection of milk from the alveoli

of the mammary glands. During lactation,
oxytocin also stimulates the recently emptied
uterus to contract, helping it to return to
pre - pregnancy size.

The mammary glands secrete a yellowish
fluid called colostrum during the initial
few days after parturition. It has less lactose
than milk and almost no fat, but it contains
more proteins, vitamin A and minerals.

Colostrum is also rich in IgA antibodies. This
helps to protect the infant’s digestive tract
against bacterial infection. Breast milk is the
ideal food for infants as it contains all the
constituents in suitable concentration and is
easily digestible. It is fully sufficient till about
6 months of age and all infants must be breast
fed by the mother to ensure the growth of a
healthy baby.

**Summary**

Reproduction is a process which helps in
the continuity and maintenance of a species.
Human beings are sexually reproducing and
viviparous. The reproductive events include
gametogenesis, insemination, Fertilization,
cleavage, implantation, placentation,
gastrulation, organogenesis and parturition.

The female reproductive system consists
of a pair of ovaries, a pair of oviducts, uterus,
cervix, vagina and external genitalia. The male
reproductive system consists of a pair of testes,
a pair of duct system, accessory glands and
external genitalia called penis.
The process of formation of gametes in
the male is called spermatogenesis and in the
female is called oogenesis. The reproductive
cycle in females is called menstrual cycle and
it is initiated at puberty. The ovum released
during the menstrual cycle is fertilized by the
sperm and the zygote is formed.
Zygote undergoes repeated mitotic division
and the blastocyst is implanted on the walls of
the uterus. It takes about 280 days or 40 weeks
for the entire development of the human foetus
and it is delivered out through the process of
child birth or parturition. The new born baby is
breast fed by the mother.
