Microbes such as bacteria, fungi,
protozoa, certain algae, viruses, viroids and
prions are some of the major components
of the biological system on Earth. Several
microorganisms are beneficial and contribute
to human welfare. Microbes are present
everywhere – in soil, water, air and within
bodies of animals and plants. Microbes like
bacteria and fungi can be grown on nutritive
media to form colonies which can be visibly
seen. Some of the microbes useful to human
welfare are discussed here.

**8.1 Microbes in household products**

In every day life, microbes and their
products are used in the preparation of idli,
dosa, cheese, curd, yogurt, dough, bread,
vinegar, etc., Bacteria like Lactobacillus
acidophilus, L. lactis and Streptococcus lactis
commonly called lactic acid bacteria (LAB)
are probiotics which check the growth of
pathogenic microbes in the stomach and
other parts of the digestive tract.
The LAB bacteria grows in milk and
convert it into curd, thereby digesting the milk
protein casein. A small amount of curd added
to fresh milk as a starter or inoculum contains
millions of Lactobacilli, which under suitable temperature (≤40<sup>0</sup>C) multiply and convert milk into curd. Curd is more nutritious than
milk as it contains a number of organic acids
and vitamins.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/note3.18.png )

Yogurt is produced by bacterial
fermentation of milk, and lactic acid is
produced as a byproduct. Microorganisms
such as Streptococcus thermophilus and
Lactobacillus bulgaricus coagulate the milk
protein and convert the lactose in the milk
to lactic acid. The flavour in yogurt is due to
acetaldehyde.

Cheese is a dairy product produced in a
wide range of flavours, textures and is formed
by coagulation of the milk protein, casein.
During cheese production, milk is usually
acidified and the enzyme rennet is added to
cause coagulation. The solids are separated and
pressed to form cheese. Most cheese are made
with a starter bacteria, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus
or Streptococcus.

Paneer (cottage cheese) is fresh cheese
common in South Asia, especially in India.
It is made by curdling milk with lemon juice,
vinegar and other edible acids. Large holes in
Swiss cheese is due to the production of large
amount of carbon-di-oxide by the bacterium
Propionibacterium shermanii.

The dough used in the preparation of idlis and
dosas are fermented by the bacteria Leuconostoc
mesenteroides whereas the dough used in
bread making is fermented by Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (Baker’s Yeast). Fermentation of
glucose mainly forms ethyl alcohol and carbon-di-oxide, which is responsible for leavening of

dough. When leavened dough is baked, both
carbon-di-oxide and ethyl alcohol evaporate
making the bread porous and soft.
Single cell protein (SCP)
Single cell protein refers to edible
unicellular microorganisms like Spirulina.
Protein extracts from pure or mixed cultures
of algae, yeasts, fungi or bacteria may be used
as ingredient or as a substitute for protein rich
foods and is suitable for human consumption
or as animal feed.

**8.2 Microbes in industrial products**

Microbes are used to synthesize a number
of products valuable to human beings. Products
like beverages, antibiotics, organic acids, amino
acids, vitamins, biofuels, single cell protein,
enzymes, steroids, vaccines, pharmaceutical
drugs, etc., are produced in industries.
Production on a large scale requires growing
microbes in very large vessels called fermentors.
A fermentor (bioreactor) is a closed vessel with
adequate arrangement for aeration, agitation,
temperature, pH control and drain or overflow
vent to remove the waste biomass of cultured
microorganisms along-with their products.

**8.2.1 Antibiotic production**

Antibiotics are chemical substances
produced by microorganisms which can kill
or retard the growth of other disease causing
microbes even in low concentration. Antibiotic
means “against life”. Antibiotics are used to treat
diseases such as plague, meningitis, diphtheria,
syphilis, leprosy, tuberculosis etc., Selman
Waksman discovered Streptomycin and was the
first to use the term “antibiotic” in 1943.
While working on Staphylococci bacteria,
Alexander Fleming observed a green mould
growing in one of his unwashed culture plates
around which Staphylococci could not grow.
He found that it was due to a chemical produced
by the mould and he named it as penicillin,
which was the first antibiotic discovered by
Alexander Fleming in 1926 (Fig. 8.1). Penicillin
is produced by the fungi Penicillium notatum
and Penicillium chrysogenum. It is bactericidal
(antibiotics that kill bacteria) in action and
inhibits the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall.
Penicillin is also referred as the “queen
of drugs” and its full potential as an effective
antibiotic was established much later by
Earnest Chain and Howard Florey when they
treated the wounded soldiers in World War II
with penicillin. Fleming, Chain and Florey
were awarded the Nobel prize in 1945 for the
discovery of penicillin.

Tetracycline is a broad spectrum
bacteriostatic antibiotic (antibiotics that limit the
growth of bacteria) that inhibits microbial protein
synthesis. Chlortetracycline is the first antibiotic
of this group, isolated from the cultures of
Streptomyces aureofaciens. Streptomycin is
a broad spectrum antibiotic isolated from
the actinomycetes, Streptomyces griseus. It is
bactericidal against both gram positive and
gram negative bacteria, especially against
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Antibiotics, such
as erythromycin, chloromycetin, griseofulvin,
neomycin, kenamycin, bacitracin, etc., are also
isolated as microbial products.

**Antibiotic resistance**

Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria
develop the ability to defeat the drug designed
to kill or inhibit their growth. It is one of the
most acute threat to public health. Antibiotic
resistance is accelerated by the misuse and
over use of antibiotics, as well as poor infection
prevention control. Antibiotics should be used
only when prescribed by a certified health
professional. When the bacteria become
resistant, antibiotics cannot fight against them
and the bacteria multiply. Narrow spectrum
antibiotics are preferred over broad spectrum
antibiotics. They effectively and accurately target
specific pathogenic organisms and are less likely
to cause resistance. "Superbug" is a term used to describe strains of bacteria that are resistant to the majority of antibiotics commonly used today.

**8.2.2 Fermented beverages**

Microbes especially yeast is being used
from time immemorial for the production
of beverages like wine, beer, whisky, brandy
and rum. Wine is among the oldest alcoholic
beverages known and is produced by
fermentation of fruit juice by yeast. Zymology
is an applied science which deals with the
biochemical process of fermentation and its
practical uses.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae commonly
called brewer’s yeast is used for fermenting
malted cereals and fruit juices to produce
various alcoholic beverages. Wine and beer
are produced without distillation, whereas
whisky, brandy and rum are obtained by
fermentation and distillation.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/note3.20.png )

Oenology is the science and study of
wine and wine making. Wine is made from
the fermentation of grape juice. Grape juice is
fermented by various strains of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae into alcohol. Grape wine is of two types,
red wine and white wine. For red wine, black
grapes are used including skins and sometimes
the stems also are used. In contrast white wine is
produced only from the juice of either white or
red grapes without their skin and stems.

Beer is produced from germinated barley
malt grain by Saccharomyces carlsbergensis
or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rum is made
from fermented sugarcane or molasses or
directly from sugarcane juice by Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. Whisky is a type of distilled alcoholic
beverage made from fermented grain mash by
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/note3.21.png )


In some parts of South India, a traditional
drink called pathaneer is obtained from
fermenting sap of palms and coconut trees.
A common source is tapping of unopened
spadices of coconut. It is a refreshing drink,
which on boiling produces jaggery or palm
sugar. When pathaneer is left undisturbed for
few hours it gets fermented to form toddy with
the help of naturally occurring yeast, to form a
beverage that contains 4 percent alcohol. After
24 hours toddy becomes unpalatable and is
used for the production of vinegar.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the major
producer of ethanol (C2H5OH). It is used for
industrial, laboratory and fuel purposes. So
ethanol is referred to as industrial alcohol.
Bacteria such as Zymomonas mobilis and Sarcina
ventriculi are also involved in ethanol production.
The principal substrates for the commercial
production of industrial alcohol include molasses
or corn, potatoes and wood wastes. The process
of ethanol production starts by milling a feed
stock followed by the addition of dilute or fungal
amylase (enzyme) from Aspergillus to break
down the starch into fermentable sugars. Yeast
is then added to convert the sugars to ethanol
which is then distilled off to obtain ethanol which
is upto 96 percent in concentration. The two
most common type of biofuels in use today are
ethanol and biodiesel, both of them represent the
first generation of biofuel technology. Ethanol is
often used as a fuel, mainly as a biofuel additive
for gasoline.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/note3.23.png )



**8.2.3 Chemicals, enzymes and other bioactive molecules**

Microbes are not only used for commercial
and industrial production of alcohol, but also
used for production of chemicals like organic
acids and enzymes. Examples of organic acid
producers are Aspergillus niger for citric acid,
Acetobacter aceti for acetic acid, Rhizopus
oryzae for fumaric acid, Clostridium
butyricum for butyric acid and Lactobacillus
for lactic acid.

Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and
bacteria are used for commercial production
of enzymes. Lipases are used in detergent
formulations and are used for removing oily
stains from the laundry. Bottled juices are
clarified by the use of pectinase, protease and
cellulase. Rennet can also be used to separate
milk into solid curds for cheese making.
Streptokinase produced by the bacterium
Streptococcus and genetically engineered
Streptococci are used as “clot buster” for removing clots from the blood vessels of
patients who have undergone myocardial
infarction.
Cyclosporin A, an immunosuppressant
used in organ transplantation is produced
from the fungus Trichoderma polysporum. It is also used for its anti-inflammatory, anti-
fungal and anti-parasitic properties. Statins produced by the yeast Monascus purpureus
have been used to lower blood cholesterol
levels. It acts by competitively inhibiting
the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of
cholesterol. Recombinant human insulin
has been produced predominantly using
E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae for
therapeutic use in human.

**8.3 Microbes in sewage treatment and energy generation**

Sewage is the waste generated every day
in cities and towns containing human excreta.
It contains large amounts of organic matter and
microbes, which are pathogenic to humans and
are bio-degradable pollutants. Domestic waste
consists of approximately 99 percent water,
suspended solids and other soluble organic and
inorganic substances. Sewage should not be
discharged directly into natural water bodies
like rivers and streams. Before disposal, sewage
should be treated in sewage treatment plants to
make it less polluting.

Microbes(mass of bacteria floc) are allowed
to grow in aerated water (secondary treatment).
They consume major part of organic matter in
the effluent and reduce the BOD in the waste
water( The details on waste water treatment are
discussed in chapter 12).

**8.3.1 Microbial fuel cell(MFC)**

A microbial fuel cell is a bio-electrochemical
system that drives an electric current by using
bacteria and mimicking bacterial interaction
found in nature (Fig. 8.2). Microbial fuel cells
work by allowing bacteria to oxidize and reduce
organic molecules. Bacterial respiration is basically
one big redox reaction in which electrons are
being moved around. A MFC consists of an anode
and a cathode separated by a proton exchange
membrane. Microbes at the anode oxidize the
organic fuel generating protons which pass
through the membrane to the cathode and the
electrons pass through the anode to the external
circuit to generate current.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.20.png )


**8.4 Microbes in the production of biogas**

Biogas is a mixture of different gases
produced by the breakdown of organic matter in
the absence of oxygen. Biogas can be produced
from raw materials such as agricultural wastes,
manure, municipal wastes, plant material,
sewage, food waste, etc., Biogas is produced
under anaerobic condition, when the organic
materials are converted through microbiological
reactions into gas and organic fertilizer. Biogas
primarily consists of methane (63 percent), along
with CO2 and hydrogen. Methane producing
bacteria are called methanogens and one such
common bacterium is Methanobacterium.
Biogas is devoid of smell and burns with a blue
flame without smoke. The Methanogens are also
present in anaerobic sludge and rumen of cattle.
In rumen, these bacteria help in the breakdown
of cellulose. The excreta of cattle called dung is
commonly called “Gobar”. Gobar gas is generated
by the anaerobic decomposition of cattle dung. It
consists of methane, CO2 with some hydrogen,
nitrogen and other gases in trace amounts.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.21.png )


In a biogas plant, anaerobic digestion is
carried out in an air tight cylindrical tank known as
digester (Fig. 8.3). It is made up of concrete bricks
and cement or steel. Bio-wastes are collected
and slurry of dung is fed into this digester. It
has a side opening into which organic materials
for digestion are incorporated for microbial
activity. Anaerobic digestion is accomplished
in three stages: solubilisation, acidogenesis and
methanogenisis. The outlet is connected to a pipe
to supply biogas. The slurry is drained through
another outlet and is used as fertilizer. Biogas is
used for cooking and lighting. The technology of
biogas production was developed in India mainly
due to the efforts of Indian Agricultural Research
Institute (IARI) and Khadi and Village Industries
Commission (KVIC).

**8.5 Bioremediation**

The use of naturally occurring or
genetically engineered
microorganisms to reduce
or degrade pollutants is called bioremediation. Bioremediation is
less expensive and more sustainable than
other remediations available. It is grouped
into in situ bioremediation (treatment of
contaminated soil or water in the site)
and ex situ bioremediation (treatment of
contaminated soil or water that is removed
from the site and treated).

**8.5.1 Microorganisms involved in bioremediation**

Aerobic microbes degrade the pollutants
in the presence of oxygen. They mainly degrade
pesticides and hydrocarbons. Pseudomonas
putida is a genetically engineered microorganism
(GEM). Ananda Mohan Chakrabarty obtained
patent for this recombinant bacterial strain.
It is multi- plasmid hydrocarbon-degrading
bacterium which can digest the hydrocarbons
in the oil spills (Fig. 8.4).


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.22.png )

Nitrosomonas europaea is also capable of
degrading benzene and a variety of halogenated
organic compounds including trichloroethylene
and vinyl chloride. Ideonella sakaiensis is
currently tried for recycling of PET plastics
(Fig. 8.5). These bacteria use PETase and
MHETase enzymes to breakdown PET plastic
into terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol.
Anaerobic microbes degrade the
pollutants in the absence of oxygen.
Dechloromonas aromatica has the ability
to degrade benzene anaerobically and to
oxidize toluene and xylene. Phanerochaete
chrysosporium an anaerobic fungus exhibits
strong potential for bioremediation of
pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, dyes, trinitrotoluene, cyanides, carbon
tetrachloride, etc., Dehalococcoides species
are responsible for anaerobic bioremediation
of toxic trichloroethene to non-toxic ethane.
Pestalotiopsis microspora is a species of
endophytic fungus capable of breaking down
and digesting polyurethane. This makes the
fungus a potential candidate for bioremediation
projects involving large quantities of plastics.

**Summary**

All microbes are not pathogenic, many of them are
beneficial to human beings. We use microbes and
their derived products almost every day. Lactic acid
bacteria convert milk into curd. Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (yeast) is used in bread making. Idly
and dosa are made from dough fermented by
microbes. Bacteria and fungi are used in cheese
making. Industrial products like lactic acid, acetic
acid and alcohol are produced by microbes.
Antibiotics are produced from useful microbes
to kill the disease causing harmful microbes. For
more than a hundred years, microbes are being
used to treat sewage by the process of activated
sludge formation. Bio-gas produced by microbes
is used as a source of energy in rural areas. In
bio-remediation naturally occurring or genetically
engineered microorganisms are used to reduce or
degrade pollutants.
