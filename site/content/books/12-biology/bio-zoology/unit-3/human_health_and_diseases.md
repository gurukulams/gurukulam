## Learning Objectives

➢ Learns about various bacterial,
viral, fungal, protozoan and
helminth diseases.

➢ Understands the life
cycle of
malarial parasite.

➢ Understands the
basic concepts of
immunology.

➢ Differentiates between innate immunity
and acquired immunity, primary
immune response and secondary
immune response, active and passive
immunity.

➢ Realizes the importance of immunization.

➢ Learns to comprehend the concept of
hypersensitivity.

➢ Learns the ill effects of drugs and alcohol.

➢ Realizes the responsibility for their
behaviour, health care and life styles.

➢ Understands the importance of
mental health.

The World Health Organization [WHO]
defines health as ‘a state of complete
physical, mental and social wellbeing and not
merely absence of diseases’. We can also say
“HEALTH IS WEALTH”, when people are
healthy they are more efficient at work. Health
increases longevity of people and reduces
infant and adult mortality. Personal hygiene,
regular exercise and balanced diet are very
important to maintain good health.

**7.1 Common diseases in human beings**

Disease can be defined as a disorder or
malfunction of the mind or body. It involves
morphological, physiological and psychological
disturbances which may be due to environmental

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/flow1.png )

factors or pathogens or genetic anomalies or life
style changes. Diseases can be broadly grouped
into infectious and non infectious types.
Diseases which are transmitted from one
person to another are called infectious diseases
or communicable diseases. Such disease
causing organisms are called pathogens
and are transmitted through air, water, food,
physical contact and vectors. The disease
causing pathogen may be virus, bacteria, fungi,
protozoan parasites, helminthic parasites, etc.,
Infectious diseases are common and everyone
suffers from such diseases at some time or the
other. Most of the bacterial diseases are curable
but all viral diseases are not. Some infectious
disease like AIDS may be fatal.
Non-infectious diseases are not
transmitted from an infected person
to a healthy person. In origin they may
be genetic (cystic fibrosis), nutritional
(vitamin deficiency diseases) and degenerative
(arthritis, heart attack, stroke). Among
non - infectious diseases, cancer is one of the
major causes of death.

**7.1.1 Bacterial and viral diseases Bacterial diseases**

Though the number of bacterial
species is very high, only a few bacteria are
associated with human diseases and are called
pathogenic bacteria. Such pathogens may

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/note3.1.png )

emit toxins and affects the body. Common
pathogenic bacteria and the bacterial diseases
are given in table 7.1.
Bacteria spread through air, water or
by inhaling the droplets/aerosols or even

living cells. Outside the living cells they
cannot carry out the characteristics of a
living organism. Viruses invade living cells,
forcing the cells to create new viruses. The
new viruses break out of the cell, killing it
and invade other cells in the body, causing
diseases in human beings. Rhino viruses cause
one of the most infectious human ailment
called the “Common cold”.
Viral diseases are generally grouped
into four types on the basis of the symptoms
produced in the body organs.

i. Pneumotropic diseases (respiratory
tract infected by influenza)

ii. Dermotropic diseases (skin and
subcutaneous tissues affected by chicken pox
and measles)

iii. Viscerotropic diseases (blood and
visceral organs affected by yellow fever and
dengue fever)

iv. Neurotropic diseases (central
nervous system affected by rabies and polio).
Some common viral diseases of human beings
are given in table 7.2.

**7.1.2 Protozoan diseases**

About 15 genera of protozoans live as
parasites within the human body and cause
diseases.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/note3.4.png )

Amoebiasis also called amoebic dysentery
or amoebic colitis is caused by Entamoeba
histolytica, which lives in the human large
intestine and feeds on mucus and bacteria
(Fig. 7.1). Infective stage of this parasite is the
trophozoite, which penetrates the walls of the
host intestine (colon) and secretes histolytic
enzymes causing ulceration, bleeding,
abdominal pain and stools with excess mucus.
Symptoms of amoebiasis can range from
diarrhoea to dysentery with blood and mucus
in the stool. House flies (Musca domestica)
acts as a carrier for transmitting the parasite
from contaminated faeces and water.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.1.png )

African sleeping sickness is caused
by Trypanosoma species. Trypanosoma is
generally transmitted by the blood sucking
Tsetse flies. Three species of Trypanosoma
cause sleeping sickness in man.

1.T. gambiense is transmitted by Glossina
palpalis (Tsetse fly) and causes Gambian or
Central African sleeping sickness (Fig. 7.2).

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.2.png )

2.T. rhodesiense is transmitted by Glossina
morsitans causing Rhodesian or East
African sleeping sickness.

3.T. cruzi is transmitted by a bug called
Triatoma megista and causes Chagas disease
or American trypanosomiasis.
Kala – azar or visceral leishmaniasis
is caused by Leishmania donovani, which
is transmitted by the vector Phlebotomus
(sand fly). Infection may occur in the endothelial
cells, bone marrow, liver, lymph glands and
blood vessels of the spleen. Symptoms of Kala
azar are weight loss, anaemia, fever, enlargement
of spleen and liver.
Malaria is caused by different types of
Plasmodium species such as P. vivax, P. ovale,
P. malariae and P. falciparum (Table 7.3).
Plasmodium lives in the RBC of human in its
mature condition it is called as trophozoite. It
is transmited from one person to another by the
bite of the infected female Anopheles mosquito.

**Life cycle of Plasmodium**

Plasmodium vivax is a digenic parasite,
involving two hosts, man as the secondary host and female Anopheles mosquito as the primary
host. The life cycle of Plasmodium involves three
phases namely schizogony, gamogony and
sporogony (Fig. 7.3).
The parasite first enters the human blood
stream through the bite of an infected female
Anopheles mosquito. As it feeds, the mosquito
injects the saliva containing the sporozoites. The
sporozoite within the blood stream immediately
enters the hepatic cells of the liver. Further in
the liver they undergo multiple asexual fission
(schizogony) and produce merozoites. After
being released from liver cells, the merozoites
penetrate the RBC’s.
Inside the RBC, the merozoite begins
to develop as unicellular trophozoites. The
trophozoite grows in size and a central vacuole
develops pushing them to one side of cytoplasm
and becomes the signet ring stage. The
trophozoite nucleus then divides asexually to
produce the schizont. The large schizont shows
yellowish - brown pigmented granules called
Schuffners granules. The schizont divides
and produces mononucleated merozoites.
Eventually the erythrocyte lyses, releasing the
merozoites and haemozoin toxin into the blood
stream to infect other erythrocytes. Lysis of
red blood cells results in cycles of fever and
other symptoms. This erythrocytic stage is
cyclic and repeats itself approximately every
48 to 72 hours or longer depending on
the species of Plasmodium involved. The
sudden release of merozoites triggers an
attack on the RBCs. Occasionally, merozoites
differentiate into macrogametocytes and
microgametocytes. When these are ingested by
a mosquito, they develop into male and female
gametes respectively.
In the mosquito's gut, the infected
erythrocytes lyse and male and female
gametes fertilize to form a diploid zygote
called ookinete. The ookinete migrates to the
mosquito's gut wall and develop into an oocyte.
The oocyte undergoes meiosis by a process
called sporogony to form sporozoites. These

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.3.png )

sporozoites migrate to the salivary glands of
the mosquito. The cycle is now completed and
when the mosquito bites another human host,
the sporozoites are injected and the cycle begins
a new.
The pathological changes caused by
malaria, affects not only the erythrocytes
but also the spleen and other visceral organs.
Incubation period of malaria is about 12 days.

The early symptoms of malaria are headache,
nausea and muscular pain. The classic
symptoms first develop with the synchronized
release of merozoites, haemozoin toxin and
erythrocyte debris into the blood stream
resulting in malarial paroxysms – shivering
chills, high fever followed by sweating. Fever
and chills are caused partly by malarial toxins
that induce macrophages to release tumour
necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin.

**Prevention**

It is possible to break the transmission
cycle by killing the insect vector. Mosquitoes
lay their eggs in water. Larvae hatch and
develop in water but breathe air by moving to
the surface. Oil can be sprayed over the water
surface, to make it impossible for mosquito
larvae and pupae to breathe.
Ponds, drainage ditches and other
permanent bodies of water can be stocked
with fishes such as Gambusia which feed on
mosquito larvae. Preparations containing
Bacillus thuringiensis can be sprayed to kill
the mosquito larvae since it is not toxic to
other forms of life. The best protection against
malaria is to avoid being bitten by mosquito.
People are advised to use mosquito nets, wire
gauging of windows and doors to prevent
mosquito bites.
In the 1950’s the World Health
Organisation (WHO) introduced the Malaria
eradication programme. This programme
was not successful due to the resistance of
Plasmodium to the drugs used to treat it and
resistance of mosquitoes to DDT and other
insecticides.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/note3.5.png )

**7.1.3 Fungal diseases**

Fungi was recognized as a causative
agent of human diseases much earlier than
bacteria. Dermatomycosis is a cutaneous infection caused by fungi belonging to the
genera Trichophyton, Microsporum and
Epidermophyton.
Ringworm is one of the most common
fungal disease in humans (Fig. 7.4).
Appearance of dry, scaly lesions on the skin,
nails and scalp are the main symptoms of the
disease. Heat and moisture help these fungi
to grow and makes them to thrive in skin
folds such as those in the groin or between
the toes. Ringworms of the feet is known
as Athlete’s foot caused by Tinea pedis
(Fig. 7.5). Ringworms are generally acquired
from soil or by using clothes, towels and comb
used by infected persons.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.4.png )

**7.1.4 Helminthic diseases**

Helminthes are mostly endoparasitic in
the gut and blood of human beings and cause
diseases called helminthiasis. The two most
prevalent helminthic diseases are Ascariasis and
Filariasis.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.5.png )

Ascaris is a
monogenic parasite
and exhibits sexual
d i m o r p h i s m .
Ascariasis is a
disease caused by the
intestinal endoparasite
Ascaris lumbricoides
commonly called
the round worms
(Fig. 7.6). It is
transmitted through
ingestion of
embryonated eggs through contaminated food
and water. Children playing in contaminated
soils are also prone to have a chance of transfer
of eggs from hand to mouth. The symptoms
of the disease are abdominal pain, vomiting,
headache, anaemia, irritability and diarrhoea.
A heavy infection can cause nutritional
deficiency and severe abdominal pain and
causes stunted growth in children. It may also
cause enteritis, hepatitis and bronchitis.
Filariasis is caused by Wuchereria
bancrofti, commonly called filarial worm. It is
found in the lymph vessels and lymph nodes of
man (Fig. 7.7). Wuchereria bancrofti is sexually

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.6.png )

dimorphic, viviparous and digenic. The life
cycle is completed in two hosts, man and the
female Culex mosquito The female filarial worm
gives rise to juveniles called microfilariae
larvae. In the lymph glands, the juveniles
develop into adults. The accumulation of the
worms block the lymphatic system resulting
in inflammation of the lymph nodes. In some
cases, the obstruction of lymph vessels causes
elephantiasis or filariasis of the limbs, scrotum
and mammary glands (Fig. 7.8).

**7.2 Maintenance of personal and public hygiene**

Hygiene is a set of practices performed to
conserve good health. According to the World
Health Organization (WHO), hygiene refers to
“conditions and practices that help to maintain
health and prevent the spread of diseases."
Personal hygiene refers to maintaining
one’s body clean by bathing, washing hands,
trimming fingernails, wearing clean clothes
and also includes attention to keeping surfaces
in the home and workplace, including toilets,
bathroom facilities, clean and pathogen-free.
Our public places teem with infection,
contamination and germs. It seems that every
surface we touch and the air we breathe are with
pollutants and microbes. It’s not just the public
places that are unclean, but we might be amazed
at the number of people who do not wash their
hands before taking food, after visiting the
restroom, or who sneeze without covering their
faces. Many infectious diseases such as typhoid,
amoebiasis and ascariasis are transmitted
through contaminated food and water.
Advancement in science and technology
provide effective controlling measures for
many infectious and non-infectious diseases.
The use of vaccines and adopted immunization
programmes have helped to eradicate small pox
in India. Moreover a large number of infectious
diseases like polio, diphtheria, pneumonia
and tetanus have been controlled by the use of
vaccines and by creating awareness among the people.

**7.3 Basic concepts of immunology**

Immunology is the study of immune
system. This system protects an indvidual
from various infective agents. It refers to
all the mechanisms used by the body for
protection from environmental agents that
are foreign to the body.
When the immune system does not
function efficiently in an individual, it leads to
infection causing disease. The overall ability
of body to fight against the disease causing
pathogen is called immunity. It is also called
disease resistance and the lack of immunity
is known as susceptibility. Immunity is highly
specific.
Normally many of the responses of the
immune system initiate the destruction and
elimination of invading organisms and any
toxic molecules produced by them. These
immune reactions are destructive in nature
and are made in response only to molecules
that are foreign to the host and not to those of
host itself. This ability to distinguish foreign
molecules from self is another fundamental
feature of the immune system. However,
occasionally, it fails to make its distinction
and reacts destructively against the host's
own molecules; such autoimmune diseases
can be fatal to the organism.

Almost all the macromolecules e.g.
proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids, etc., as long as they are foreign to recipient organism
can induce immune response. Any substance
capable of eliciting immune response is called
an ANTIGEN (ANTIbody GENerator). There
are two broad classes of immunity responses
namely, innate immunity and acquired
immunity (Fig. 7.9).

**7.3.1 Innate immunity**

Innate immunity is the natural
phenomenon of resistance to infection which
an individual possesses right from the birth.
The innate defense mechanisms are non-specific
in the sense that they are effective against a
wide range of potentially infectious agents. It is
otherwise known as non-specific immunity or
natural immunity.
A number of innate defense mechanisms are
operative non-specifically against a large number
of microorganisms as shown in the Table 7.4 and
Fig. 7.10.
