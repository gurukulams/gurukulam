Mendel’s theory dispelled the mystery
of why traits seemed to appear and
disappear magically from one generation to
the next. Mendel’s work reveals the patterns of
heredity and reflect the transmission of evolved
information from parents to offspring. This
information is located on the chromosomes.
One of the most advanced realizations of
human knowledge was that our unique
characteristics are encoded within molecules
of DNA. The discovery that DNA is the genetic
material left several questions unanswered.
How is the information in DNA used? Scientists
now know that DNA directs the construction
of proteins. Proteins determine the shapes of
cells and the rate of chemical reactions, such
as those that occur during metabolism and
photosynthesis. The hereditary nature of every
living organism is defined by its genome,
which consists of a long sequence of nucleic
acids that provide the information needed to
construct the organism. The genome contains
the complete set of hereditary information for
any organism. The genome may be divided into
a number of different nucleic acid molecules.
Each of the nucleic acid molecule may contain
large number of genes. Each gene is a sequence
within the nucleic acid that represents a single
protein. In this chapter we will discuss the
structure of DNA, its replication, the process
of making RNA from DNA (transcription), the
genetic code that determines the sequence of
amino acid in protein synthesis (translation),
regulation of gene expression and the essentials
of human genome sequencing.


##### <u> 5.1 Gene as the functional unit of inheritance </u>

A gene is a basic physical and functional
unit of heredity. The concept of the gene
was first explained by **Gregor Mendel** in
**1860’s**. He never used the term ‘gene’. He
called it ‘factor’. In 1909, the Danish biologist
Wilhelm Johannsen, coined the term ‘gene’,
that was referred to discrete determiners of
inherited characteristics.

According to the classical concept of
gene introduced by Sutton in 1902, genes
have been defined as discrete particles that
follow Mendelian rules of inheritance,
occupy a definite locus in the chromosome
and are responsible for the expression of
specific phenotypic character. They show the
following properties:

* Number of genes in each organism is
more than the number of chromosomes;
hence several genes are located on the
same chromosome.


* The genes are arranged in a single linear
order like beads on a string.

* Each gene occupies a specific position
called locus.


* Genes may exist in several alternate forms
called alleles.

* Genes may undergo sudden change
in positions and composition called
mutations.

* Genes are capable of self-duplication
producing their own copies.

**One gene-one enzyme hypothesis**

The experiments of George Beadle
and Edward Tatum in the early 1940’s
on Neurospora crassa (the red bread
mould) led them to propose one gene-
one enzyme hypothesis, which states that
one gene controls the production of one
enzyme.


**One gene-one polypeptide hypothesis**

It was observed that an enzyme
may be composed of more than one
polypeptide chain and a gene can code
for only one polypeptide chain. Thus one
gene-one polypeptide hypothesis states
that one gene controls the production of
only one polypeptide chain of an enzyme
molecule.

##### <u> 5.2 In search of the genetic material </u>

As early as 1848, Wilhelm Hofmeister,
a German botanist, had observed that cell
nuclei organize themselves into small,
rod like bodies during mitosis called
chromosomes. In 1869, Friedrich Miescher,
a Swiss physician, isolated a substance from
the cell nuclei and called it as nuclein. It
was renamed as nucleic acid by Altman
(1889), and is now known as DNA. By 1920,
it became clear that chromosomes are made
up of proteins and DNA. Many experiments
were carried out to study the actual carriers
of genetic information. Griffith's experiment
proved that DNA is the genetic material
which has been dealt in class XI. Bacterial
transformation experiments provided the
first proof that DNA is the genetic material.
However, he could not understand the
cause of bacterial transformation, and the
biochemical nature of genetic material was
not defined from his experiments.
Later, Oswald Avery, Colin Macleod and
Maclyn McCarty in 1944 repeated Griffith’s
experiments in an ‘in vitro’ system in order

![Fig. 5.1 Transformation experiment of Avery et. al., (1944)](/books/12-biology/botany/Ecology/pic9.png )

to identify the nature of the transforming
substance responsible for converting a non-
virulent strain into virulent strain. They
observed that the DNA, RNA and proteins
isolated from the heat-killed S-strain
when added to R-strain changed their
surface character from rough to smooth
and also made them pathogenic **(Fig. 5.1)**.
But when the extract was treated with
**DNase** (an enzyme which destroys DNA)
the transforming ability was lost. **RNase**
(an enzyme which destroys RNA) and
**proteases** (an enzyme which destroys protein)
did not affect the transformation. Digestion
with DNase inhibited transformation
suggesting that the DNA caused the
transformation. These experiments suggested
that DNA and not proteins is the genetic
material. The phenomenon, by which DNA
isolated from one type of cell (S – strain),
when introduced into another type (R-strain),
is able to retain some of the properties of the
S - strain is referred to as **transformation**.
