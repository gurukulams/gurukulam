Mendel’s theory dispelled the mystery
of why traits seemed to appear and
disappear magically from one generation to
the next. Mendel’s work reveals the patterns of
heredity and reflect the transmission of evolved
information from parents to offspring. This
information is located on the chromosomes.
One of the most advanced realizations of
human knowledge was that our unique
characteristics are encoded within molecules
of DNA. The discovery that DNA is the genetic
material left several questions unanswered.
How is the information in DNA used? Scientists
now know that DNA directs the construction
of proteins. Proteins determine the shapes of
cells and the rate of chemical reactions, such
as those that occur during metabolism and
photosynthesis. The hereditary nature of every
living organism is defined by its genome,
which consists of a long sequence of nucleic
acids that provide the information needed to
construct the organism. The genome contains
the complete set of hereditary information for
any organism. The genome may be divided into
a number of different nucleic acid molecules.
Each of the nucleic acid molecule may contain
large number of genes. Each gene is a sequence
within the nucleic acid that represents a single
protein. In this chapter we will discuss the
structure of DNA, its replication, the process
of making RNA from DNA (transcription), the
genetic code that determines the sequence of
amino acid in protein synthesis (translation),
regulation of gene expression and the essentials
of human genome sequencing.


##### <u> 5.1 Gene as the functional unit of inheritance </u>

A gene is a basic physical and functional
unit of heredity. The concept of the gene
was first explained by **Gregor Mendel** in
**1860’s**. He never used the term ‘gene’. He
called it ‘factor’. In 1909, the Danish biologist
Wilhelm Johannsen, coined the term ‘gene’,
that was referred to discrete determiners of
inherited characteristics.

According to the classical concept of
gene introduced by Sutton in 1902, genes
have been defined as discrete particles that
follow Mendelian rules of inheritance,
occupy a definite locus in the chromosome
and are responsible for the expression of
specific phenotypic character. They show the
following properties:

* Number of genes in each organism is
more than the number of chromosomes;
hence several genes are located on the
same chromosome.


* The genes are arranged in a single linear
order like beads on a string.

* Each gene occupies a specific position
called locus.


* Genes may exist in several alternate forms
called alleles.

* Genes may undergo sudden change
in positions and composition called
mutations.

* Genes are capable of self-duplication
producing their own copies.

**One gene-one enzyme hypothesis**

The experiments of George Beadle
and Edward Tatum in the early 1940’s
on Neurospora crassa (the red bread
mould) led them to propose one gene-
one enzyme hypothesis, which states that
one gene controls the production of one
enzyme.


**One gene-one polypeptide hypothesis**

It was observed that an enzyme
may be composed of more than one
polypeptide chain and a gene can code
for only one polypeptide chain. Thus one
gene-one polypeptide hypothesis states
that one gene controls the production of
only one polypeptide chain of an enzyme
molecule.

##### <u> 5.2 In search of the genetic material </u>

As early as 1848, Wilhelm Hofmeister,
a German botanist, had observed that cell
nuclei organize themselves into small,
rod like bodies during mitosis called
chromosomes. In 1869, Friedrich Miescher,
a Swiss physician, isolated a substance from
the cell nuclei and called it as nuclein. It
was renamed as nucleic acid by Altman
(1889), and is now known as DNA. By 1920,
it became clear that chromosomes are made
up of proteins and DNA. Many experiments
were carried out to study the actual carriers
of genetic information. Griffith's experiment
proved that DNA is the genetic material
which has been dealt in class XI. Bacterial
transformation experiments provided the
first proof that DNA is the genetic material.
However, he could not understand the
cause of bacterial transformation, and the
biochemical nature of genetic material was
not defined from his experiments.
Later, Oswald Avery, Colin Macleod and
Maclyn McCarty in 1944 repeated Griffith’s
experiments in an ‘in vitro’ system in order

![Fig. 5.1 Transformation experiment of Avery et. al., (1944)](/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic9.png)

to identify the nature of the transforming
substance responsible for converting a non-
virulent strain into virulent strain. They
observed that the DNA, RNA and proteins
isolated from the heat-killed S-strain
when added to R-strain changed their
surface character from rough to smooth
and also made them pathogenic **(Fig. 5.1)**.
But when the extract was treated with
**DNase** (an enzyme which destroys DNA)
the transforming ability was lost. **RNase**
(an enzyme which destroys RNA) and
**proteases** (an enzyme which destroys protein)
did not affect the transformation. Digestion
with DNase inhibited transformation
suggesting that the DNA caused the
transformation. These experiments suggested
that DNA and not proteins is the genetic
material. The phenomenon, by which DNA
isolated from one type of cell (S – strain),
when introduced into another type (R-strain),
is able to retain some of the properties of the
S - strain is referred to as **transformation**.

#### <u> 5.3 DNA is the genetic material </u>

Many biologists despite the earlier
experiments of Griffith, Avery and others,
still believed that protein, not DNA, was the
hereditary material in a cell. As eukaryotic
chromosomes consist of roughly equal
amounts of protein and DNA, it was said
that only a protein had sufficient chemical
diversity and complexity to encode the
information required for genetic material.
In 1952, however, the results of the
Hershey-Chase experiment finally provided
convincing evidence that DNA is the genetic
material.

### 5.3.1 Hershey and Chase experiment on T2 bacteriophage

**Alfred Hershey** and **Martha Chase** (1952)
conducted experiments on bacteriophages
that infect bacteria. Phage T2 is a virus that
infects the bacterium *Escherichia coli*. When
phages (virus) are added to bacteria, they
adsorb to the outer surface, some material
enters the bacterium, and then later each
bacterium lyses to release a large number of
progeny phage. Hershey and Chase wanted to
observe whether it was DNA or protein that
entered the bacteria. All nucleic acids contain
phosphorus, and proteins contain sulphur
(in the amino acid cysteine and methionine).
Hershey and Chase designed an experiment
using radioactive isotopes of Sulphur (35S)
and phosphorus (32P) to keep separate track of
the viral protein and nucleic acids during the
infection process. The phages were allowed
to infect bacteria in culture medium which
containing the radioactive isotopes 35S or 32P.
The bacteriophage that grew in the presence of
35S had labelled proteins and bacteriophages
grown in the presence of 32P had labelled DNA.
The differential labelling thus enabled them to
identify DNA and proteins of the phage.
Hershey and Chalse mixed the labelled
phages with unlabeled E. coli and allowed
bacteriophages to attack and inject their
genetic material. Soon after infection
(before lysis of bacteria), the bacterial cells
were gently agitated in a blender to loosen the
adhering phase particles. It was observed that
only 32P was found associated with bacterial
cells and 35S was in the surrounding medium
and not in the bacterial cells. When phage
progeny was studied for radioactivity, it was
found that it carried only 32P and not 35S
**(Fig. 5.2)**. These results clearly indicate
that only DNA and not protein coat entered
the bacterial cells. Hershey and Chase
thus conclusively proved that it was DNA,
not protein, which carries the hereditary
information from virus to bacteria.

#### 5.4 Chemistry of Nucleic Acids

Having identified the genetic material as
the nucleic acid DNA (or RNA), we proceed
to examine the chemical structure of these
molecules. Generally nucleic acids are a
long chain or polymer of repeating subunits
called nucleotides. Each nucleotide subunit is
composed of three parts: a nitrogenous base,
a five carbon sugar (pentose) and a phosphate
group.

#### Pentose sugar

There are two types of nucleic acids
depending on the type of pentose sugar.
Those containing deoxyribose sugar are called
**Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid (DNA)** and those
with ribose sugar are known as **Ribonucleic**
Acid (RNA). DNA is found in the nucleus
of eukaryotes and nucleoid of prokaryotes.
The only difference between these two
sugars is that there is one oxygen atom less in
deoxyribose.

#### Nitrogenous bases

The bases are nitrogen containing
molecules having the chemical properties
of a base (a substance that accepts H+ ion or
proton in solution). DNA and RNA both have
four bases (two purines and two pyrimidines)
in their nucleotide chain. Two of the bases,
Adenine (A) and Guanine (G) have double
carbon–nitrogen ring structures and are
called purines. The bases, Thymine (T),
Cytosine (C) and Uracil (U) have single ring
structure and these are called pyrimidines.
Thymine is unique for DNA, while Uracil is
unique for RNA.

#### The phosphate functional group

It is derived from phosphoric acid
(H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>), has three active OH-
groups of which two are involved in strand formation. The
phosphate functional group (PO4) gives DNA
and RNA the property of an acid (a substance
that releases an H+ ion or proton in solution)
at physiological pH, hence the name
**nucleic acid.** The bonds that are formed from
phosphates are esters. The oxygen atom of the
phosphate group is negatively charged after
the formation of the phosphodiester bonds.
This negatively charged phosphate ensures
the retention of nucleic acid within the cell or
nuclear membrane.

#### Nucleoside and nucleotide

The nitrogenous base is chemically
linked to one molecule of sugar (at the
1-carbon of the sugar) forming a **nucleoside**.
When a phosphate group is attached to the
5' carbon of the same sugar, the nucleoside
becomes a **nucleotide**. The nucleotides are
joined (polymerized) by condensation
reaction to form a polynucleotide chain. The
hydroxyl group on the 3' carbon of a sugar of
one nucleotide forms an ester with the
phosphate of another nucleotide. The
chemical bonds that link the sugar
components of adjacent nucleotides are called
phosphodiester bond (5'--> 3'), indicating
the polarity of the strand.

The ends of the DNA or RNA are distinct.
The two ends are designated by the symbols
5' and 3'. The symbol 5' refers to carbon in the
sugar to which a phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub>) functional
group is attached. The symbol 3' refers to
carbon in the sugar to which hydroxyl (OH)
functional group is attached. In RNA, every
nucleotide residue has an additional <sup>-</sup>
OH group at 2' position in the ribose.
Understanding the 5'--> 3' direction of a
nucleic acid is critical for understanding the
aspects of replication and transcription.

Based on the X - ray diffraction analysis of
**Maurice Wilkins** and **Rosalind Franklin**, the
double helix model for DNA was proposed by
James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953. The
highlight was the base pairing between the
two strands of the polynucleotide chain. This
proposition was based on the observations
of Erwin Chargaff that Adenine pairs with
Thymine (A = T) with two hydrogen bonds
and Guanine pairs with Cytosine (G ≡ C)
with three hydrogen bonds. The ratios
between Adenine with Thymine and Guanine
with Cytosine are constant and equal. The
base pairing confers a unique property to
the polynucleotide chain. They are said to be
complementary to each other, that is, if the
sequence of bases in one strand (template) is
known, then the sequence in the other strand
can be predicted. The salient features of DNA
structure has already been dealt in class XI.

### 5.5 RNA world

A typical cell contains about ten times as
much RNA as DNA. The high RNA content
is mainly due to the variety of roles played by
RNA in the cell. **Fraenkel-Conrat** and **Singer**
(1957) first demonstrated that **RNA** is the
genetic material in RNA containing viruses
like TMV (Tobacco Mosaic Virus) and they
separated RNA from the protein of TMV
viruses. Three molecular biologists in the early
1980’s (Leslie Orgel, Francis Brick and Carl
Woese) independently proposed the **‘RNA world’** 
as the first stage in the evolution of
life, a stage when RNA catalysed all molecules
necessary for survival and replication. The
term ‘RNA world’ first used by **Walter Gilbert**
in 1986, hypothesizes RNA as the first genetic
material on earth. There is now enough
evidence to suggest that essential life processes
(such as metabolism, translation, splicing etc.,)
evolved around RNA. RNA has the ability to act
as both genetic material and catalyst. There are
several biochemical reactions in living systems
that are catalysed by RNA. This catalytic
RNA is known as **ribozyme.** But, RNA being
a catalyst was reactive and hence unstable.
This led to evolution of a more stable form of
DNA, with certain chemical modifications.
Since DNA is a double stranded molecule
having complementary strand, it has resisted
changes by evolving a process of repair. Some
RNA molecules function as gene regulators by
binding to DNA and affect gene expression.
Some viruses use RNA as the genetic material.
Andrew Fire and Craig Mellow (recipients of
Nobel Prize in 2006) were of the opinion that
RNA is an active ingredient in the chemistry of
life. The types of RNA and their role have been
discussed in class XI.

### <u> 5.6 Properties of genetic material </u>

The experiment by Hershey and Chase
clearly indicates that it is DNA that acts
as a genetic material. However, in some
viruses like Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV),
bacteriophage θB, RNA acts as the genetic
material. A molecule that can act as a genetic
material should have the following properties:

*  Self Replication: It should be able to
replicate. According to the rule of base
pairing and complementarity, both nucleic
acids (DNA and RNA) have the ability to
direct duplications. Proteins fail to fulfill
this criteria

* Stability: It should be stable structurally and
chemically. The genetic material should be
stable enough not to change with different
stages of life cycle, age or with change in
physiology of the organism. Stability as one
of property of genetic material was clearly
evident in Griffith’s transforming principle.
Heat which killed the bacteria did not
destroy some of the properties of genetic
material. In DNA the two strands being
complementary, if separated (denatured) by
heating can come together (renaturation)
when appropriate condition is provided.
Further 2' OH group present at every
nucleotide in RNA is a reactive
group that makes RNA liable and
easily degradable. RNA is also
known to be catalytic and reactive.
Hence, DNA is chemically more
stable and chemically less reactive
when compared to RNA. Presence
of thymine instead of uracil in
DNA confers additional stability
to DNA.


*  **Information storage:** It should be
able to express itself in the form
of **‘Mendelian characters’.** RNA
can directly code for protein
synthesis and can easily express
the characters. DNA, however
depends on RNA for synthesis
of proteins. Both DNA and RNA
can act as a genetic material, but
DNA being more stable stores
the genetic information and RNA
transfers the genetic information.


* **Variation through mutation:**

 It should be able to mutate. Both
DNA and RNA are able to mutate.
RNA being unstable, mutates at a
faster rate. Thus viruses having
RNA genome with shorter life span can
mutate and evolve faster.

The above discussion indicates that both
RNA and DNA can function as a genetic
material. DNA is more stable, and is preferred
for storage of genetic information.

### <u> 5.7 Packaging of DNA helix </u>

The distance between two consecutive
base pairs is 0.34nm (0.34×10-9m) of the
DNA double helix in a typical mammalian
cell. When the total number of base pairs is
multiplied with the distance between two
consecutive base pairs (6.6 × 10<sup>9</sup> × 0.34 ×10<sup>-9</sup> m/bp), the length of DNA double helix is
approximately 2.2 m. (The total length of the

![Fig. 5.3 Condensation of DNA - A - DNA, B-Nucleosomes and Histones, C- Chromatin fiber, D- Coiled chromatin fiber, E- Coiled coil, F- metaphase chromatid](/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic12.png)

double helical DNA = total number of base
pairs × distance between two consecutive
base pairs). If the length of E. coli DNA is
1.36 mm, the number of base pairs in E. coli is
4 ×10<sup>6</sup> bp (1.36 × 10<sup>3</sup>m/0.34 ×10<sup>-9</sup>). The
length of the DNA double helix is far greater
than the dimension of a typical mammalian
nucleus (approximately 10-6 m). How is such a
long DNA polymer packaged in a cell?


Chromosomes are carriers of genes which
are responsible for various characters from
generation to generation. Du Praw (1965)
proposed a single stranded model (unineme),
as a long coiled molecule which is associated
with histone proteins in eukaryotes. Plants
and animals have more DNA than bacteria
and must fold this DNA to fit into the cell
nucleus. In prokaryotes such as E. coli though
they do not have defined nucleus, the DNA
is not scattered throughout the cell. DNA
(being negatively charged) is held with some
proteins (that have positive charges) in a
region called the nucleoid. The DNA as a
nucleoid is organized into large loops held
by protein. DNA of prokaryotes is almost
circular and lacks chromatin organization,
hence termed **genophore.**


In eukaryotes, this organization is much more
complex. Chromatin is formed by a series of
repeating units called **nucleosomes.** Kornberg
proposed a model for the nucleosome, in
which 2 molecules of the four histone proteins
H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 are organized to
form a unit of eight molecules called **histone**
**octamere.** The negatively charged DNA
is wrapped around the positively charged
histone octamere to form a structure called
**nucleosome.** A typical nucleosome contains
200 bp of DNA helix. The histone octameres
are in close contact and DNA is coiled on
the outside of nucleosome. Neighbouring
nucleosomes are connected by linker DNA
(H1) that is exposed to enzymes. The DNA
makes two complete turns around the histone
octameres and the two turns are sealed off by
an H1 molecule. Chromatin lacking H1 has a
**beads-on-a-string** appearance in which DNA
enters and leaves the nucleosomes at random
places. H1 of one nucleosome can interact
with H1 of the neighbouring nucleosomes
resulting in the further folding of the fibre.
The chromatin fiber in interphase nuclei and
mitotic chromosomes have a diameter that
vary between 200-300 nm and represents
inactive chromatin. 30 nm fibre arises from the
folding of nucleosome, chains into a solenoid
structure having six nucleosomes per turn. This
structure is stabilized by interaction between
different H1 molecules. DNA is a **solenoid**and
packed about 40 folds. The hierarchical nature
of chromosome structure is illustrated in
**(Fig. 5.3).** Additional set of proteins are
required for packing of chromatin at higher
level and are referred to as non-histone
chromosomal proteins (NHC). In a typical
nucleus, some regions of chromatin are
loosely packed (lightly stained) and are
referred to as euchromatin. The chromatin
that is tightly packed (stained darkly) is
called heterochromatin. Euchromatin is
transcriptionally active and heterochromatin
is transcriptionally inactive.

### <u> 5.8 DNA Replication </u>

Replication of DNA takes place during the
S phase of cell cycle. During replication, each
DNA molecule gives rise to two DNA strands,
identical to each other as well as to the parent
strand. Three hypotheses of DNA replication
have been proposed. They are conservative
replication, dispersive replication, and semi-
conservative replication.

In conservative replication, the original
double helix serves as a template. The original
molecule is preserved intact and an entirely
new double stranded molecule is synthesized.
In dispersive replication, the original molecule
is broken into fragments and each fragment

![Fig. 5.4 Semiconservative DNA replication](/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic13.png)

serves as a template for the synthesis of
complementary fragments. Finally two new
molecules are formed which consist of both
old and new fragments.

Semi-conservative replication was
proposed by Watson and Crick in 1953. This
mechanism of replication is based on the
DNA model. They suggested that the two
polynucleotide strands of DNA molecule
unwind and start separating at one end.
During this process, covalent hydrogen bonds
are broken. The separated single strand then
acts as template for the synthesis of a new
strand. Subsequently, each daughter double
helix carries one polynucleotide strand from
the parent molecule that acts as a template
and the other strand is newly synthesised
and complementary to the parent strand
**(Fig. 5.4).**


### <u> 5.8.1 Experimental proof of DNA replication </u>

The mode of DNA replication was
determined in 1958 by Meselson and Stahl.
They designed an experiment to distinguish
between semi conservative, conservative and
dispersive replications. In their experiment,
they grew two cultures of E.coli for many
generations in separate media. The ‘heavy’
culture was grown in a medium in which
the nitrogen source (NH4Cl) contained the
heavy isotope 15N and the ‘light’ culture was
grown in a medium in which the nitrogen

![Fig. 5.5 Meselson and Stahl experiment to support semiconservative mode of DNAreplication](/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic14.png)

source contained light isotope 14N for many
generations. At the end of growth, they
observed that the bacterial DNA in the heavy
culture contained only 15N and in the light
culture only 14N. The heavy DNA could be
distinguished from light DNA (15N from 14N)
with a technique called **Cesium Chloride**
**(CsCl) density gradient centrifugation.** In
this process, heavy and light DNA extracted
from cells in the two cultures settled into two
distinct and separate bands (hybrid DNA)
(Fig. 5.5).

The heavy culture (15N) was then transferred
into a medium that had only NH4Cl, and took
samples at various definite time intervals
(20 minutes duration). After the
first replication, they extracted DNA
and subjected it to density gradient
centrifugation. The DNA settled into a
band that was intermediate in position
between the previously determined heavy
and light bands. After the second replication
(40 minutes duration), they again extracted
DNA samples, and this time found the DNA
settling into two bands, one at the light band
position and one at intermediate position.
These results confirm Watson and Crick’s
semi conservative replication hypothesis.

####  <u>  5.8.2 Enzymes and mechanism of replication </u>

In prokaryotes, replication process
requires three types of DNA polymerases
(DNA polymerase I, II, and III). DNA
polymerase III is the main enzyme involved
in DNA replication. DNA polymerase I
(also known as Kornberg enzyme) and
DNA polymerase II are involved in DNA
repair mechanism. Eukaryotes have five
types of DNA polymerases that catalyses
the polymerization of nucleotides at the
3' OH of the new strand within a short
period of time. E.coli that has 4.6 X 10<sup>6</sup>bp
completes its replication process within
38 minutes. Replication takes place faster at
the same time accurately. Any error will lead
to mutation. However replication errors are
corrected by repair enzymes such as nucleases.
Deoxy nucleotide triphosphate acts as substrate
and also provides energy for polymerization
reaction.

Replication begins at the initiation site called
the site of **‘origin of replication’** (ori). In
prokaryotes, there is only one origin of
replication, whereas in eukaryotes with giant
DNA molecules, there can be several origins of
replication (replicons). Since the two strands of
DNA cannot be separated throughout at a time
(due to large requirement of energy) the
replication occurs within a small opening of the
DNA helix called as replication fork. Unwinding
of the DNA strand is carried out by DNA
helicase. Thus, in one strand (template strand
with polarity 3' --> 5') the replication is
continuous and is known as the leading strand
while in the other strand (coding strand with
polarity 5'--> 3') replication is discontinuous,
known as the **lagging strand (Fig. 5.6).** The
discontinuously synthesized fragments of the
lagging strand (called the **Okazaki fragments**)
are joined by the enzyme DNA ligase.

![Fig 5.6 Mechanism of replication showing a replication fork](/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic15.png)

As they move away in both directions, newly
synthesized complementary nucleotides are
paired with the existing nucleotides on the
parent strand and covalently bonded together
by **DNA polymerase**. Formation of new strand
requires a primer (a short stretch of RNA)for
initiation. The primer produces a 3'-OH end on
the sequence of ribonucleotides, to which deoxy
ribonucleotides are added. The RNA primer is
ultimately removed leaving a gap in the newly
synthesized DNA strand. It is removed from
5' end one by one by the exonuclease activity
of DNA polymerase. Finally, when all the
nucleotides are in position, gaps are sealed by
the enzyme **DNA ligase.**

At the point of origin of replication, the
helicases and topoisomerases (DNA gyrase)
unwind and pull apart the strands, forming a
Y-Shaped structure called the (**replication fork.**)
There are two replication forks at each origin.
The two strands of a DNA helix have an
antiparallel orientation. The enzyme DNA
polymerase can only catalyse the addition of a
nucleotide to the new strands in the 5' ---> 3'
direction, as it can only add nucleotides to the
3' carbon position.

#### <u> 5.9 Transcription </u>

Francis Crick proposed the Central dogma
of protein synthesis in molecular biology
states that genetic information flows as
follows:

![](/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic16.png)

The process of copying genetic information
from one strand of DNA into RNA is
termed transcription. This process takes
place in presence of DNA dependent RNA
polymerase. In some retroviruses that contain
RNA as the genetic material (e.g, HIV), the flow
of information is reversed. RNA synthesizes
DNA by reverse transcription, then transcribed
into mRNA by transcription and then into
proteins by translation.


For a cell to operate, its genes must be
expressed. This means that the gene products,
whether proteins or RNA molecules must be
made. The RNA that carries genetic information
encoding a protein from genes into the cell is
known as messenger RNA (mRNA). For a gene
to be transcribed, the DNA which is a double
helix must be pulled apart temporarily, and
RNA is synthesized by RNA polymerase. This
enzyme binds to DNA at the start of a gene and
opens the double helix. Finally, RNA molecule
is synthesized. The nucleotide sequence in the
RNA is complementary to the DNA template
strand from which it is synthesized.


Both the strands of DNA are not copied
during transcription for two reasons. 1. If both
the strands act as a template, they would code
for RNA with different sequences. This in turn
would code for proteins with different amino
acid sequences. This would result in one segment
of DNA coding for two different proteins, hence
complicate the genetic information transfer
machinery. 2. If two RNA molecules were
produced simultaneously, double stranded RNA
complementary to each other would be formed.
This would prevent RNA from being translated
into proteins.

#### <u> 5.9.1 Transcription unit and gene </u>

A transcriptional unit in DNA is defined by
three regions, a **promoter, the structural gene**
and a **terminator**. The promoter is located
towards the 5' end of the coding strand. It is a
DNA sequence that provides binding site for
RNA polymerase. The presence of promoter
in a transcription unit, defines the template
and coding strands. The terminator region
located towards the 3' end of the coding strand
contains a DNA sequence that causes the RNA
polymerase to stop transcribing. In eukaryotes
the promoter has AT rich regions called
**TATA box (Goldberg-Hogness box)** and in

![](/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic17.png)

prokaryotes this region is called **Pribnow box**.
Besides promoter, eukaryotes also require an
enhancer.


The two strands of the DNA in the structural
gene of a transcription unit have opposite
polarity. DNA dependent RNA polymerase
catalyses the polymerization in only one
direction, the strand that has the polarity
3' 5' acts as a template, and is called the
**template strand**. The other strand which has
the polarity 5' 3' has a sequence same as
RNA (except thymine instead of uracil) and is
displaced during transcription. This strand is
**called coding strand (Fig. 5.7).**


The structural gene may be **monocistronic**
(eukaryotes) or **polycistronic (prokaryotes)**. In
eukaryotes, each mRNA carries only a single
gene and encodes information for only a single
protein and is called monocistronic mRNA. In
prokaryotes, clusters of related genes, known as
operon, often found next to each other on the
chromosome are transcribed together to give a
single mRNA and hence are polycistronic.

Before starting transcription, RNA polymerase
binds to the promoter, a recognition sequence in
front of the gene. Bacterial (prokaryotic) RNA
polymerase consists of two major components,
the core enzyme and the sigma subunit. The
core enzyme (2α, β, β1 and ω) is responsible
for RNA synthesis whereas a sigma subunit is
responsible for recognition of the promoter.
Promoter sequences vary in different organisms.

RNA polymerase opens up the DNA to form the
transcription bubble. The core enzyme moves
ahead, manufacturing RNA leaving the sigma
subunit behind at the promoter region. The end
of a gene is marked by a terminator sequence
that forms a hair pin structure in the RNA. The
sub-class of terminators require a recognition
protein, known as rho (ρ), to function.

### <u> 5.9.2 Process of transcription </u>

In prokaryotes, there are three major types of
RNAs: mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA. All three RNAs
are needed to synthesize a protein in a cell. The
mRNA provides the template, tRNA brings amino
acids and reads the genetic code, and rRNAs play
structural and catalytic role during translation.
There is a single DNA-dependent RNA polymerase
that catalyses transcription of all types of RNA. It
binds to the promoter and initiates transcription
(Initiation). The polymerases binding sites are
called promoters. It uses nucleoside triphosphate as
substrate and polymerases in a template depended
fashion following the rule of complementarity.
After the initiation of transcription, the polymerase
continues to elongate the RNA, adding one
nucleotide after another to the growing RNA
chain. Only a short stretch of RNA remains bound
to the enzyme, when the polymerase reaches a
terminator at the end of a gene, the nascent RNA
falls off, so also the RNA polymerase.

The question is, how the RNA polymerases
are able to catalyse the three steps initiation,
elongation and termination? The RNA


![](/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic18.png)

polymerase is only capable of catalyzing the
process of elongation. The RNA polymerase
associates transiently with initiation factor sigma
(σ) and termination factor rho (r) to initiate
and terminate the transcription, respectively.
Association of RNA with these factors instructs
the RNA polymerase either to initiate or
terminate the process of transcription **(Fig. 5.8).**


In bacteria, since the mRNA does not
require any processing to become active
and also since transcription and translation
take place simultaneously in the same
compartment (since there is no separation of
cytosol and nucleus in bacteria), many times
the translation can begin much before the
mRNA is fully transcribed. This is because
the genetic material is not separated from
other cell organelles by a nuclear membrane
consequently; transcription and translation
can be coupled in bacteria.
In Eukaryotes, there are at least three RNA
polymerases in the nucleus (in addition to RNA
polymerase found in the
organelles). There is a clear
division of labour. The RNA
polymerase I transcribes
rRNAs (28S, 18S and
5.8S), whereas the RNA
polymerase III is responsible
for transcription of tRNA,
5S rRNA and snRNA.
The RNA polymerase
II transcribes precursor
of mRNA, the hnRNA
(heterogenous nuclear
RNA). In eukaryotes, the
monocistronic structural
genes have interrupted coding sequences
known as exons (expressed sequences) and non-
coding sequences called introns (intervening
sequences). The **introns** are removed by a process
called **splicing.** hnRNA undergoes additional
processing called **capping and tailing**. In capping
an unusual nucleotide, methyl guanosine
triphosphate is added at the 5' end, whereas
adenylate residues (200-300) (Poly A) are added
at the 3' end in tailing **(Fig. 5.9)**. Thereafter,
this processed hnRNA, now called mRNA is
transported out of the nucleus for translation.

The split gene feature of eukaryotic genes
is almost entirely absent in prokaryotes.
Originally each exon may have coded for
a single polypeptide chain with a specific
function. Since exon arrangement and intron
removal are flexible, the exon coding for
these polypeptide subunits act as domains
combining in various ways to form new genes.
Single genes can produce different functional
proteins by arranging their exons in several
different ways through alternate splicing

patterns, a mechanism known to play an
important role in generating both protein and
functional diversity in animals. Introns would
have arosen before or after the evolution of
eukaryotic gene. If introns arose late how did
they enter eukaryotic gene? Introns are mobile
DNA sequences that can splice themselves
out of, as well as into, specific ‘target sites’
acting like mobile transposon-like elements
(that mediate transfer of genes between
organisms – Horizontal Gene Transfer -
HGT). HGT occurs between lineages of
prokaryotic cells, or from prokaryotic to
eukaryotic cells and between eukaryotic cells.
HGT is now hypothesized to have played a
major role in the evolution of life on earth.

#### 5.10 Genetic Code

DNA is the genetic material that carries
genetic information in a cell and from
generation to generation. At this stage, an
attempt will be made to determine in what
manner the genetic information exists in DNA
molecule? Are they written in coded language
on a DNA molecule? If they occur in the
language of codes
what is the nature
of genetic code?
The translation of
proteins follows
the triplet rule;
a sequence of
three mRNA base
(a codon) designates
one of the 20
different kinds of
amino acids used in
protein synthesis.

Genetic code is the
sequence relationship
between nucleotide in
genes (or mRNA) and
the amino acids in the
proteins they encode.
There are 64 possible
triplets, and 61 of them are used to represent
amino acids. The remaining three triplet codons
are termination signals for polypeptide chains.
Since there are only 20 amino acids involved
in protein synthesis, most of them are encoded
by more than one triplet. Two things make this
multiple (degenerate) coding possible. First,
there is more than one tRNA for most amino
acids. Each tRNA has a different anticodon.
Second, this pairing is highly specific for the
first two portions on the codon, permitting
Watson and Crick base pairs (A – U and G - C)
to be formed. But at the third position there is
a great deal of flexibility as to which base pairs
are acceptable. Most part of the genetic code is
universal, being the same in prokaryotes and
eukaryotes.

The order of base pairs along DNA molecule
controls the kind and order of amino acids
found in the proteins of an organism. This
specific order of base pairs is called genetic
code, the blue print establishing the kinds of
proteins to be synthesized which makes an
organism unique.

**Marshall Nirenberg, Severo Ochoa**
(enzyme polynucleotide phosphorylase called
Ochoa’s enzyme), **Hargobind Khorana, Francis**
Crick and many others have contributed
significantly to decipher the genetic code. The
order in which bases are arranged in mRNA
decides the order in which amino acids are
arranged in proteins. Finally a checker board
for genetic code was prepared **(table 5.1)**.

The salient features of genetic code are as
follows:

* The genetic codon is a triplet code and
61 codons code for amino acids and
3 codons do not code for any amino acid
and function as stop codon (Termination).


* The genetic code is universal. It means
that all known living systems use nucleic
acids and the same three base codons
(triplet codon) direct the synthesis of protein
from amino acids. For example, the mRNA
(UUU) codon codes for phenylalanine in all
cells of all organisms. Some exceptions are
reported in prokaryotic, mitochondrial and
chloroplast genomes. However similarities
are more common than differences.

* A non-overlapping codon means that the
same letter is not used for two different
codons. For instance, the nucleotide
sequence GUU GUC represents only two
codons.


*  It is comma less, which means that the
message would be read directly from one
end to the other i.e., no punctuation are
needed between two codes.


* A degenerate code means that more than
one triplet codon could code for a specific
amino acid. For example, codons GUU,
GUC, GUA and GUG code for valine.


*  Non-ambiguous code means that one
codon will code for one amino acid.


*  The code is always read in a fixed direction
i.e. from 5'→3' direction called polarity.


*  AUG has dual functions. It acts as a
initiator codon and also codes for the
amino acid methionine.

* UAA, UAG and UGA) codons are
designated as termination (stop) codons
and also are known as “non-sense” codons.

### <u> 5.10.1 Mutation and genetic code </u>

Comparative studies of mutations (sudden
change in a gene) and corresponding
alteration in amino acid sequence of specific
protein have confirmed the validity of the
genetic code. The relationship between genes
and DNA are best understood by mutation
studies. The simplest type of mutation at the
molecular level is a change in nucleotide that
substitutes one base for another. Such changes
are known as base substitutions which may
occur spontaneously or due to the action of
mutagens. A well studied example is sickle
cell anaemia in humans which results from a
point mutation of an allele of β-haemoglobin
gene (βHb). A haemoglobin molecule
consists of four polypeptide chains of two
types, two α chains and two β-chains. Each
chain has a heme group on its surface. The
heme groups are involved in the binding of
oxygen. The human blood disease, sickle cell
anaemia is due to abnormal haemoglobin.
This abnormality in haemoglobin is due to
a single base substitution at the sixth codon
of the beta globin gene from GAG to GTG in
β -chain of haemoglobin. It results in a change
of amino acid glutamic acid to valine at the
6th position of the β -chain. This is the classical
example of point mutation that results in the
change of amino acid residue glutamic acid to
valine **(Fig. 5.10)**. The mutant haemoglobin

#### <u> Wobble Hypothesis </u>

It is a hypothesis proposed by Crick
(1966) which states that tRNA anticodon
has the ability to wobble at its 5’ end by
pairing with even non-complementary
base of mRNA codon. According to this
hypothesis, in codon-anticodon pairing
the third base may not be complementary.
The third base of the codon is called
wobble base and this position is called
wobble position. The actual base pairing
occurs at first two positions only. The
importance of Wobbling hypothesis
is that it reduces the number of tRNAs
required for polypeptide synthesis and it
overcomes the effect of code degeneracy.

In the above example though the
codon and the anti codon do not match
perfectly, yet the required amino acid
is brought perfectly. This enables the
economy of tRNA, GUU, GUC, GUA and
GUG code for the amino acid - Valine.

undergoes polymerisation under oxygen
tension causing the change in the shape of
the RBC from biconcave to a sickle shaped
structure.


The effect of point mutation can be
understood by the following example.


**ABC DEF GHI JKL**


If we insert a letter **O between DEF**
and GHI the arrangement would be


**ABC DEF OGH IJK L**


If we insert **OQ** at the same place the
arrangement would be

**ABC DEF OQG HIJ KL**

The above information shows that insertion
or deletion of one or two bases, changes the
reading frame from the point of insertions or
deletions. Such mutations are referred to as
frame shift insertion or deletion mutations.
This forms the genetic basis of proof that codon
is a triplet and is read in a continuous manner

### 5.11. tRNA – the adapter molecule

The transfer RNA, (tRNA) molecule of a
cell acts as a vehicle that picks up the amino
acids scattered through the cytoplasm and
also reads specific codes of mRNA molecules.
Hence it is called an **adapter molecule.** This
term was postulated by Francis Crick.


The two dimensional clover leaf model of
tRNA was proposed by Robert Holley. The
secondary structure of tRNA depicted in
Fig. 5.11 looks like a clover leaf. In actual
structure, the tRNA is a compact molecule
which looks like an inverted L. The clover
leaf model of tRNA shows the presence of
three arms namely DHU arm, middle arm
and TΨC arm. These arms have loops such
as amino acyl binding loop, anticodon loop
and ribosomal binding loop at their ends.
In addition it also shows a small lump called
