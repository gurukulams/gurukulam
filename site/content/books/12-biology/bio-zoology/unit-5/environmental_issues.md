Aclean environment is very necessary
to live a peaceful and healthy life. But
our environment is getting dirty day by day
because of our negligence. Earth is currently
facing a lot of environmental concerns like air
pollution, water pollution, and noise pollution,
global warming, acid rain, biomagnification,
eutrophication, deforestation, waste disposal,
ozone layer depletion and climate change.
Over the last few decades, the exploitation of
our planet and degradation of our environment
have gone up at an alarming rate. As our
actions have not been in favour of protecting
this planet, we have seen natural disasters
striking us more often in the form of flash
floods, tsunami and cyclones.

“Every individual should be environmentally
aware, regardless of whether they work with
environmental issues or not.”

## <u>12.1 Pollution </u>

Pollution is any undesirable change in the
physical, chemical and biological characteristics
of the environment due to natural causes and
human activities. The agents which cause
pollution are called pollutants. Pollution is
classified according to the types of environment
that is affected. They are mainly air, water and
soil pollution.

### <u> 12.1.1 Classification of Pollutants </u>

**In terms of eco-system, pollutants can be classified into two basic groups – Non- degradable and degradable.** Based on the time
taken to breakdown into their ingredients,
degradable pollutants are classified as rapidly
degradable (non-persistent) and slowly
degradable (persistent).

**a) Rapidly degradable or non-persistent pollutants:**
These can be broken down by
natural processes. Domestic sewage and
vegetable waste are examples of such pollutants.

**b) Slowly degradable or persistent pollutants:**
 These are pollutants that remain
in the environment for many years in an
unchanged condition and take decades or
longer to degrade, as in the case of DDT.

**c) Non-degradable pollutants:** These
cannot be degraded by natural processes.
Once they are released into the environment,
they are difficult to be eliminated and
continue to accumulate (biomagnification).
Toxic elements like lead, mercury, cadmium,
chromium and nickel are such common
pollutants.

### 12.2 Air Pollution

Earth is surrounded by a gaseous envelope
which is called atmosphere. The gaseous
blanket of the atmosphere acts as a thermal
insulator and regulates the temperature of
the earth by selectively absorbing The UV
rays of solar radiation. The adverse effects
of pollution include depletion of Ozone
by Chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs, used as
refrigerants and global warming by elevated
CO2 (industries, deforestation, and partial
combustion).

The alterations or changes in the composition
of the earth’s atmosphere by natural or human
activities (anthropogenic factors) are referred as
**Air Pollution.** Pollutants include the abundant
presence of solid, liquid or gaseous substances
produced by human or natural activity. The
nature and concentration of a pollutant
determines the severity of detrimental effects

![](/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic57.png)

on organisms and human health. Along with
atmospheric factors (humidity, precipitation,
wind, air currents, altitude) prevailing at a place
and time, its effects can be far reaching and
catastrophic.

Air pollutants can be

* discharge of dusts or particulate matter
(PM: 2.5-10 μm)
* discharge of gases (SO<sup>2</sup>, NO<sup>2</sup>, CO, CO<sup>2</sup>)

Carbon monoxide (CO) is produced mainly
due to incomplete combustion of fossil fuels.
Automobiles are major causes of CO pollution
in large cities and towns Automobile exhausts,
fumes from factories, emission from power
plants, forest fires and burning of fire-wood
contribute to CO pollution.
With rapid urbanization, major amount of
carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide (SO2) is
released in the atmosphere. From automobiles,
aeroplanes, power plants and other human
activities that involving the burning of fossil
fuels (coal, oil etc.,) CO<sup>2</sup> is the main pollutant
that is leading to **global warming.**

**Nitrogen oxides** are also major air
pollutants. Fossil fuel combustion and
automobiles exhausts are the source of
nitrogen oxides. Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen
oxides are the major causes of acid rain.
Particulate matters are tiny particles of
solid matter suspended in a gas or liquid.
Combustion of fossil fuels, fly ash produced
in thermal power plants, forest fires, asbestos
mining units, cement factories are the main
sources of particulate matter pollution.


### <u> 12.2.1 Sources </u>

The main sources of air pollution are:
* **• Transport sources (Fig12.1)** – cars, buses,
airplanes, trucks, trains

* **Stationary sources** – power plants,
incinerators, oil refineries, industrial
facilities, and factories

* **Area sources**– agricultural - wood /
stubble burning, fireplaces

* **Natural sources** – wind-blown dust,
wildfires, volcanoes.


## <u> 12.2.2 Effects of Air Pollution </u>

* Affects all organisms as they depend on the
atmosphere for respiration.

* Causes irritation in the throat, nose, lungs
and eyes. It causes breathing problems and
aggravates existing health conditions such
as emphysema and asthma.

*  Contaminated air reduces the body’s
defense mechanism and decreases the
body’s capacity to fight other infections
in the respiratory system.

* Frequent exposure to polluted air increases
the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
Breathing air that is filled with fine
particulate matter can induce hardening of
the arteries, triggering cardiac arrhythmia
or even a heart attack.

* People who exercise outdoors can
sometimes be susceptible to adverse effects
of air pollution because it involves deeper
and faster breathing. Hence it is advisable to
walk or jog in the mornings in places with
ample tree cover.

* Gas leaks can be lethal or affect the quality
of air in the affected area.

* CO in the atmosphere interferes with O2
transport since haemoglopin has greater
affinity for carbon monoxide. At low
concentration it causes headache and
blurred vision. In higher concentration, it
can lead to coma and death.

## <u> 12.2.3 Other notable effects of Air Pollution </u>

**Smog** is a type of air pollution caused by tiny
particles in the air. The word comes from a
mixture of the words smoke and fog .

Today, smog generally refers to photochemical
smog, which is created when sunlight reacts
with nitrogen oxides and volatile organic
compounds found in fossil fuel emissions
from automobiles, factories, and power plants.
These reactions create ground-level ozone and
particulate matter, reducing visibility. Smog can
make breathing more difficult, especially for
people with asthma.

Smog also affects plants and animals. It
damages crops as well as causes health problems
in pets, farm animals and human beings. Smog
has also been known to cause corrosive damage
to buildings and vehicles.

**Peroxyacetyl nitrate** (PAN) is a secondary
pollutant present in photochemical smog. It
is thermally unstable and decomposes into
peroxyethanol radicals and nitrogen dioxide
gas causing eye irritation.

**Global warming:** Increase in the
concentrations of greenhouse gases such as
CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, CFCs, and ozone
causes greenhouse effect, warming of the earth,
resulting in sea level rise, submerging of islands
and sea shores of various parts of the world.
Ozone depletion: Thinning of the
stratospheric ozone layer is known as ozone
depletion. Such depletion causes the ‘ozone hole’,
resulting in poor screening of the harmful UV
rays and increase in incidences of skin cancer.
Some of the common agents that deplete ozone
are CFCs.

**Acid rain:** Acid rain is a form of precipitation
that contains acidic components, such as
sulphuric acid or nitric acid. It damages trees,
crops and harms marine animals (coral reefs)
and induces corrosion.

## <u> 12.2.4 Control of Air Pollution </u>

Certain measures help to remove pollutants,
reduce their presence or prevent their entry into
the atmosphere.
* Trees are the best remedy for urban
particulate and gaseous pollution

* Forests act as carbon sinks and lungs of
the planet

* Catalytic converters in vehicles help to
reduce polluting gases drastically

* Diesel exhaust filters in automobiles cuts
particulates

* Electrostatic precipitators reduce release
of industrial pollutants

* Cost effective air pollution treatment
systems like indoor plants and high
performance biofilters can improve
indoor air quality

heritage site, is facing deterioration and
damage by industrial gases due to several
industrial units around Agra. The white
marble has decolorized to yellow.

### <u> 12.2.5 Legal Protection</u>

* The Air (Prevention and Control of
Pollution) Act was enacted in 1981 and
amended in 1987 for the prevention,
control and abatement of Air pollution in
India.

* Traffic Emissions Standards: The
Government has decided to enforce Bharat
Stage VI norms from 2020.

*  The Green Bench and the National Green
Tribunal (NGT) give judicial safeguard to
environmental protection.

Steps taken by the Central and the State
governments in India:

* Road traffic rationing, encourage public
transport, carpooling

* Increase green cover alongside roads
(planting avenue trees)

* Promoting Swachh Bharat Abhiyan

* Enactment and Enforcement of stricter
environmental laws

* Maintenance of air standards by proper
enforcement and monitoring

### <u> 12.3 Water Pollution </u>

#### 12.3.1 Quality of Water

Water is essential for life and for the health of
the environment. As a valuable natural resource,
it comprises marine, estuarine, freshwater
(river and lakes) and groundwater environments
that stretch across coastal and inland areas.
Water has two dimensions that are closely linked:
quantity and quality. Water quality is commonly
defined by its physical, chemical, biological and
aesthetic (appearance and smell) characteristics.
A healthy environment is one in which the water
quality supports a rich and varied community of
organisms and protects public health.

#### 12.3.2 Water Pollution

Water pollution occurs when there is a
change in the chemical, physical or biological
quality of water that has harmful effect(s) on
living organisms that consume it or live in it.
Water pollution adversely affects water
bodies due to the large amounts of natural
or man-made materials let into it. When it
becomes unfit for its intended use, water is
considered polluted.

#### 12.3.3 Sources of Water Pollution

Even though water bodies or sources can be
polluted by natural causes, water pollution is
usually caused by human activities. There are
three main types of sources: point sources,
non-point sources, leaks and spills.

**Point sources:** Discharge of pollutants at
specific locations through pipelines or sewers
into the water body. Factory effluents, sewage,
underground mines, oil wells, oil tankers
and agriculture are common point sources
(Fig. 12.2 a).

**Non-point sources:** Sources that cannot be
traced to a single site of discharge like acid
rain, dumping of the plastics in water bodies,
agriculture chemical run off are common
examples **(Fig. 12.2 b).**

![Fig 12.2 Sources of water pollution](/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic59.png)

**Leaks and Spills:** This occurs mostly due to
ship collision, off shore oil rigs, oil leakages
and discharges into sea **(Fig. 12.2 c).**

Sources of water pollution can also be classified
in three ways. They are municipal wastes,
industrial wastes, and agricultural wastes.

![](/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic60.png)

1. Municipal waste water is from homes and
commercial establishments.

2. Industrial discharge (effluents) may
contain varieties of compounds such
as heavy metals (cadmium, chromium,
lead), and organic / inorganic chemicals
containing waste water, sometimes in toxic
concentrations. These discharges can affect
temperatures of the water bodies as well as
dissolved oxygen level.

3. Agricultural wastes include fertiliser and
pesticide runoff from agricultural fields,
food processing waste, tree and saw dust
from logging operations and bacteria from
sewage or livestock operations.
Water pollutants reach water bodies like
rivers, streams and the marine system by
precipitation, run-off and the groundwater by
seepage or percolation.

### <u> 12.3.4 Effect of Water pollution on Ecosystems </u>

**1. Destruction of ecosystems:**Ecosystems,
especially aquatic systems, can be severely
affected or destroyed by water pollution.
Water pollutants affect existing niches and
habitats and the survival of organisms. Soil
fertility is affected and the system becomes
uninhabitable.


**2. Disruption of food-chains:** Water
pollution disrupts the natural food chains
as well as food webs. Pollutants such as
lead and cadmium are taken up by primary
consumers where they can be lethal or
get stored. Later, when these animals are
consumed by secondary consumers, the
food chain can get disrupted at any trophic
level or result in enhanced concentration
of these pollutants (biomagnification). Hot
water from industries when released into
the water bodies affects aquatic density and
diversity.

### <u> 12.3.5. Effect of Water pollution on Organisms </u>

1. Water pollution can be lethal to aquatic
organisms and others that depend on these
water bodies.

Accidental oil spills from tanker ships can cause
substantial environmental damage. Oil spreads
on the water surface, prevents the entry of light
and oxygen into the water. This increases BOD
and COD, resulting in mass death of organisms
and degradation of water quality. It also clogs
fish gills and the feathers of aquatic birds.

{{< box >}}

On January 28, 2017, two cargo ships
collided off the Ennore coast in Chennai
causing oil to spill into the sea. Due to wave
action and the southern current, the spill
spread over to 34 km down south affecting
the coast. Beach sand also got spoiled by
the oil sludge. It took more than a thousand
volunteers to clean the oil sludge.

{{< /box >}}

2. Humans and other organisms can get
affected by diseases such as hepatitis and
typhoid by consuming contaminated
water and food. Excess of fluoride in
drinking water causes fluorosis. In many
poor nations, outbreak of water borne
diseases and epidemics are a result of
contaminated water and poor or absence
of water treatment processes.

3. Water pollution can cause eutrophication
due to nutrient enrichment. This causes
algal blooms which affect the quality
of water bodies **(Fig. 12.3).** Red tides, if
occur, can be lethal to aquatic organisms.

![Fig. 12.3 Algal bloom](/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic61.png)

### <u> 12.3.6 Control Measures </u>
1. Right to clean water is a fundamental
right under the Indian Constitution
(Article 21).

2. Water (Prevention and Control of
Pollution) Act, 1974, sections 17 to 40
prohibit the pollution of a stream or well
by disposal of polluting matter.

3. The Central/State Pollution Control
Boards have the power to advise the
central/state government on various
matters concerned with the prevention
and control of pollution of water.

4. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and
Climate Change (MoEFCC) is the nodal
agency of the Central Government for
the planning, promotion, co-ordination
and for overseeing the implementation
of India’s environmental and forestry
policies and programmes.

5. National river conservation plan (NRCP)
was enacted in 1995 to improve the water
quality of the rivers, which are the major
fresh water resources in our country. This
important assignment taken up under the
NRCP includes,

To capture the raw sewage flowing into the
river through open drains and divert them
for treatment.
Setting up sewage treatment plants for
treating the diverted sewage.
Construction of low cost sanitation toilets
to prevent open defecation on river banks.
Prevention

*  Regulate or control of pollutant(s)
discharge at the point of generation.

*  Wastewater can be pretreated by scientific
methods before discharge to municipal
treatment sources.

*  Setting up of Sewage Treatment Plants
(STP) and Effluent Treatment Plants (ETP).

*  Regulate or restrict the use of synthetic
fertilisers and pesticides.

*  Public awareness and peoples’ involvement
is essential.

**Assessment by CPCB**

The number of polluted stretches in
India’s rivers has increased to 351 from
302 (in 2006), and the number of critically
polluted stretches – where water quality
indicators are the poorest – has gone
up to 45 from 35 (Source: The Hindu,
17 September, 2018).

### <u> Case study </u>

**Namami Gange (National Mission for Clean Ganga) Programme** is an
Integrated Conservation Mission approved
as the ‘Flagship Programme’ of the Union
Government in June 2014 with a budget
outlay of 20,000 crores to accomplish the
twin objectives of effective abatement of
pollution, conservation and rejuvenation of
River Ganga.

#### <u>12.4 Noise Pollution</u>

Sound that is unwanted and undesirable or
can disrupts one’s quality of life is called as Noise.
When there is lot of ‘noise’ in the environment,
it is termed as Noise Pollution. The intensity of
noise is meaured in decibels (dB).

#### <u> 12.4.1 Sources of Noise Pollution </u>

Vehicle engines, air horns, audio video
systems, trains, low flying aircrafts, factory
machines, sirens, motors, drillers and
crushers, compressor machines, crackers,
explosives, modern supersonic transports are
the common sources of noise pollution.

The threshold of pain is about 120 db.
World Health Organization has proposed that
noise must be recognized as a major threat to
human well-being. This is applicable for all
living organisms.

#### <u>12.4.2 Effect of Noise Pollution  </u>

* According to the USEPA (United States
Environmental Protection Agency) there
are direct links between noise and health.
Heart disease, high blood pressure, stress
related illness, sleep disruption, hearing
loss (deafness), and productivity loss are
the problems related to noise pollution.

* Increased stress and tension, nervousness,
irritability, anxiety, depression and panic
attacks.

* Peptic ulcer, severe head ache,
memory loss.

* Marine animals are affected by noise
pollution from offshore activities and port
activities.

* Fire crackers frighten animals. Birds are
often affected by increased air traffic.

#### <u>  12.4.3 Control </u>

* Planting trees in and around noise sources
is an effective solution for noise pollution
as plants are known to absorb noise and
bring down sound levels.

* Regular servicing and tuning of
automobile engines can effectively reduce
noise pollution by vehicles and machinery.

* Workers should be provided with ear plugs
and earmuffs at work sites that generate
high noise levels.

* Lubrication of machinery and regular
servicing minimizes noise levels.

* Regulations should be imposed to restrict
the usage of loudspeakers in crowded
areas and public places.

#### 12.4.4 Legal Protection

Article 48-A and Article 51-A of the
Constitution of India, Noise Pollution
(Regulation and Control) Rules 2000, and
Tamil Nadu State Environment Policy
2017 are some of the legal relief from noise
pollution.

According to Noise Pollution (Regulation
and Control) Rules, 2000, the permissible
limit of noise in areas categorized as
commercial is 65 decibels (dB) during day
and 55 dB during night.

### <u>  12.5 Agrochemicals </u>

Chemicals which are used in agriculture for
growth of plants and pest control are called
agrochemicals or agrichemicals.

Overuse of agrochemicals have been observed
to generate residues that cause nutrient
imbalance. In addition,
* May kill beneficial bacteria and soil
organisms.

* Can cause eutrophication in water bodies.

* Affect aquatic animals and their productivity.

* Pesticide containing water, even in trace
quantities is unfit for human consumption.

* Particles (aerosols) and residues of these
chemicals cause air pollution.

* Inhalation of contaminated air can cause
respiratory problems.

![](/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic62.png)

* Consumption can lead to poisoning, side
effects and after effects.

* Chemicals can cause skin rashes and
irritation of eyes.

* Many of these chemicals are reported to be
carcinogenic.

* They can trigger hormonal disorders and
neurotoxicity.

* Beneficial insects and animals can be
affected.

### <u>12.6 Biomagnification  </u>
Food chains are components of all
ecosystems. Producers and consumers form
trophic levels in a chain through which energy
flow is carried out by the process of eating and
being eaten. Usage, storage and transformation
of food and biomolecules by metabolism are a
normal process. Degradation or breakdown is
an essential part of any food chain and hence all
naturally occurring substances are degradable.
