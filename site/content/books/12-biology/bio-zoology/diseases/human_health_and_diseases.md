## Learning Objectives

➢ Learns about various bacterial,
viral, fungal, protozoan and
helminth diseases.

➢ Understands the life
cycle of
malarial parasite.

➢ Understands the
basic concepts of
immunology.

➢ Differentiates between innate immunity
and acquired immunity, primary
immune response and secondary
immune response, active and passive
immunity.

➢ Realizes the importance of immunization.

➢ Learns to comprehend the concept of
hypersensitivity.

➢ Learns the ill effects of drugs and alcohol.

➢ Realizes the responsibility for their
behaviour, health care and life styles.

➢ Understands the importance of
mental health.

The World Health Organization [WHO]
defines health as ‘a state of complete
physical, mental and social wellbeing and not
merely absence of diseases’. We can also say
“HEALTH IS WEALTH”, when people are
healthy they are more efficient at work. Health
increases longevity of people and reduces
infant and adult mortality. Personal hygiene,
regular exercise and balanced diet are very
important to maintain good health.

**7.1 Common diseases in human beings**

Disease can be defined as a disorder or
malfunction of the mind or body. It involves
morphological, physiological and psychological
disturbances which may be due to environmental

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/flow1.png )

factors or pathogens or genetic anomalies or life
style changes. Diseases can be broadly grouped
into infectious and non infectious types.
Diseases which are transmitted from one
person to another are called infectious diseases
or communicable diseases. Such disease
causing organisms are called pathogens
and are transmitted through air, water, food,
physical contact and vectors. The disease
causing pathogen may be virus, bacteria, fungi,
protozoan parasites, helminthic parasites, etc.,
Infectious diseases are common and everyone
suffers from such diseases at some time or the
other. Most of the bacterial diseases are curable
but all viral diseases are not. Some infectious
disease like AIDS may be fatal.
Non-infectious diseases are not
transmitted from an infected person
to a healthy person. In origin they may
be genetic (cystic fibrosis), nutritional
(vitamin deficiency diseases) and degenerative
(arthritis, heart attack, stroke). Among
non - infectious diseases, cancer is one of the
major causes of death.

**7.1.1 Bacterial and viral diseases Bacterial diseases**

Though the number of bacterial
species is very high, only a few bacteria are
associated with human diseases and are called
pathogenic bacteria. Such pathogens may

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/note3.1.png )

emit toxins and affects the body. Common
pathogenic bacteria and the bacterial diseases
are given in table 7.1.
Bacteria spread through air, water or
by inhaling the droplets/aerosols or even

living cells. Outside the living cells they
cannot carry out the characteristics of a
living organism. Viruses invade living cells,
forcing the cells to create new viruses. The
new viruses break out of the cell, killing it
and invade other cells in the body, causing
diseases in human beings. Rhino viruses cause
one of the most infectious human ailment
called the “Common cold”.
Viral diseases are generally grouped
into four types on the basis of the symptoms
produced in the body organs.

i. Pneumotropic diseases (respiratory
tract infected by influenza)

ii. Dermotropic diseases (skin and
subcutaneous tissues affected by chicken pox
and measles)

iii. Viscerotropic diseases (blood and
visceral organs affected by yellow fever and
dengue fever)

iv. Neurotropic diseases (central
nervous system affected by rabies and polio).
Some common viral diseases of human beings
are given in table 7.2.

**7.1.2 Protozoan diseases**

About 15 genera of protozoans live as
parasites within the human body and cause
diseases.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/note3.4.png )

Amoebiasis also called amoebic dysentery
or amoebic colitis is caused by Entamoeba
histolytica, which lives in the human large
intestine and feeds on mucus and bacteria
(Fig. 7.1). Infective stage of this parasite is the
trophozoite, which penetrates the walls of the
host intestine (colon) and secretes histolytic
enzymes causing ulceration, bleeding,
abdominal pain and stools with excess mucus.
Symptoms of amoebiasis can range from
diarrhoea to dysentery with blood and mucus
in the stool. House flies (Musca domestica)
acts as a carrier for transmitting the parasite
from contaminated faeces and water.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.1.png )

African sleeping sickness is caused
by Trypanosoma species. Trypanosoma is
generally transmitted by the blood sucking
Tsetse flies. Three species of Trypanosoma
cause sleeping sickness in man.

1.T. gambiense is transmitted by Glossina
palpalis (Tsetse fly) and causes Gambian or
Central African sleeping sickness (Fig. 7.2).

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.2.png )

2.T. rhodesiense is transmitted by Glossina
morsitans causing Rhodesian or East
African sleeping sickness.

3.T. cruzi is transmitted by a bug called
Triatoma megista and causes Chagas disease
or American trypanosomiasis.
Kala – azar or visceral leishmaniasis
is caused by Leishmania donovani, which
is transmitted by the vector Phlebotomus
(sand fly). Infection may occur in the endothelial
cells, bone marrow, liver, lymph glands and
blood vessels of the spleen. Symptoms of Kala
azar are weight loss, anaemia, fever, enlargement
of spleen and liver.
Malaria is caused by different types of
Plasmodium species such as P. vivax, P. ovale,
P. malariae and P. falciparum (Table 7.3).
Plasmodium lives in the RBC of human in its
mature condition it is called as trophozoite. It
is transmited from one person to another by the
bite of the infected female Anopheles mosquito.

**Life cycle of Plasmodium**

Plasmodium vivax is a digenic parasite,
involving two hosts, man as the secondary host and female Anopheles mosquito as the primary
host. The life cycle of Plasmodium involves three
phases namely schizogony, gamogony and
sporogony (Fig. 7.3).
The parasite first enters the human blood
stream through the bite of an infected female
Anopheles mosquito. As it feeds, the mosquito
injects the saliva containing the sporozoites. The
sporozoite within the blood stream immediately
enters the hepatic cells of the liver. Further in
the liver they undergo multiple asexual fission
(schizogony) and produce merozoites. After
being released from liver cells, the merozoites
penetrate the RBC’s.
Inside the RBC, the merozoite begins
to develop as unicellular trophozoites. The
trophozoite grows in size and a central vacuole
develops pushing them to one side of cytoplasm
and becomes the signet ring stage. The
trophozoite nucleus then divides asexually to
produce the schizont. The large schizont shows
yellowish - brown pigmented granules called
Schuffners granules. The schizont divides
and produces mononucleated merozoites.
Eventually the erythrocyte lyses, releasing the
merozoites and haemozoin toxin into the blood
stream to infect other erythrocytes. Lysis of
red blood cells results in cycles of fever and
other symptoms. This erythrocytic stage is
cyclic and repeats itself approximately every
48 to 72 hours or longer depending on
the species of Plasmodium involved. The
sudden release of merozoites triggers an
attack on the RBCs. Occasionally, merozoites
differentiate into macrogametocytes and
microgametocytes. When these are ingested by
a mosquito, they develop into male and female
gametes respectively.
In the mosquito's gut, the infected
erythrocytes lyse and male and female
gametes fertilize to form a diploid zygote
called ookinete. The ookinete migrates to the
mosquito's gut wall and develop into an oocyte.
The oocyte undergoes meiosis by a process
called sporogony to form sporozoites. These

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.3.png )

sporozoites migrate to the salivary glands of
the mosquito. The cycle is now completed and
when the mosquito bites another human host,
the sporozoites are injected and the cycle begins
a new.
The pathological changes caused by
malaria, affects not only the erythrocytes
but also the spleen and other visceral organs.
Incubation period of malaria is about 12 days.

The early symptoms of malaria are headache,
nausea and muscular pain. The classic
symptoms first develop with the synchronized
release of merozoites, haemozoin toxin and
erythrocyte debris into the blood stream
resulting in malarial paroxysms – shivering
chills, high fever followed by sweating. Fever
and chills are caused partly by malarial toxins
that induce macrophages to release tumour
necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin.

**Prevention**

It is possible to break the transmission
cycle by killing the insect vector. Mosquitoes
lay their eggs in water. Larvae hatch and
develop in water but breathe air by moving to
the surface. Oil can be sprayed over the water
surface, to make it impossible for mosquito
larvae and pupae to breathe.
Ponds, drainage ditches and other
permanent bodies of water can be stocked
with fishes such as Gambusia which feed on
mosquito larvae. Preparations containing
Bacillus thuringiensis can be sprayed to kill
the mosquito larvae since it is not toxic to
other forms of life. The best protection against
malaria is to avoid being bitten by mosquito.
People are advised to use mosquito nets, wire
gauging of windows and doors to prevent
mosquito bites.
In the 1950’s the World Health
Organisation (WHO) introduced the Malaria
eradication programme. This programme
was not successful due to the resistance of
Plasmodium to the drugs used to treat it and
resistance of mosquitoes to DDT and other
insecticides.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/note3.5.png )

**7.1.3 Fungal diseases**

Fungi was recognized as a causative
agent of human diseases much earlier than
bacteria. Dermatomycosis is a cutaneous infection caused by fungi belonging to the
genera Trichophyton, Microsporum and
Epidermophyton.
Ringworm is one of the most common
fungal disease in humans (Fig. 7.4).
Appearance of dry, scaly lesions on the skin,
nails and scalp are the main symptoms of the
disease. Heat and moisture help these fungi
to grow and makes them to thrive in skin
folds such as those in the groin or between
the toes. Ringworms of the feet is known
as Athlete’s foot caused by Tinea pedis
(Fig. 7.5). Ringworms are generally acquired
from soil or by using clothes, towels and comb
used by infected persons.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.4.png )

**7.1.4 Helminthic diseases**

Helminthes are mostly endoparasitic in
the gut and blood of human beings and cause
diseases called helminthiasis. The two most
prevalent helminthic diseases are Ascariasis and
Filariasis.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.5.png )

Ascaris is a
monogenic parasite
and exhibits sexual
d i m o r p h i s m .
Ascariasis is a
disease caused by the
intestinal endoparasite
Ascaris lumbricoides
commonly called
the round worms
(Fig. 7.6). It is
transmitted through
ingestion of
embryonated eggs through contaminated food
and water. Children playing in contaminated
soils are also prone to have a chance of transfer
of eggs from hand to mouth. The symptoms
of the disease are abdominal pain, vomiting,
headache, anaemia, irritability and diarrhoea.
A heavy infection can cause nutritional
deficiency and severe abdominal pain and
causes stunted growth in children. It may also
cause enteritis, hepatitis and bronchitis.
Filariasis is caused by Wuchereria
bancrofti, commonly called filarial worm. It is
found in the lymph vessels and lymph nodes of
man (Fig. 7.7). Wuchereria bancrofti is sexually

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.6.png )

dimorphic, viviparous and digenic. The life
cycle is completed in two hosts, man and the
female Culex mosquito The female filarial worm
gives rise to juveniles called microfilariae
larvae. In the lymph glands, the juveniles
develop into adults. The accumulation of the
worms block the lymphatic system resulting
in inflammation of the lymph nodes. In some
cases, the obstruction of lymph vessels causes
elephantiasis or filariasis of the limbs, scrotum
and mammary glands (Fig. 7.8).

**7.2 Maintenance of personal and public hygiene**

Hygiene is a set of practices performed to
conserve good health. According to the World
Health Organization (WHO), hygiene refers to
“conditions and practices that help to maintain
health and prevent the spread of diseases."
Personal hygiene refers to maintaining
one’s body clean by bathing, washing hands,
trimming fingernails, wearing clean clothes
and also includes attention to keeping surfaces
in the home and workplace, including toilets,
bathroom facilities, clean and pathogen-free.
Our public places teem with infection,
contamination and germs. It seems that every
surface we touch and the air we breathe are with
pollutants and microbes. It’s not just the public
places that are unclean, but we might be amazed
at the number of people who do not wash their
hands before taking food, after visiting the
restroom, or who sneeze without covering their
faces. Many infectious diseases such as typhoid,
amoebiasis and ascariasis are transmitted
through contaminated food and water.
Advancement in science and technology
provide effective controlling measures for
many infectious and non-infectious diseases.
The use of vaccines and adopted immunization
programmes have helped to eradicate small pox
in India. Moreover a large number of infectious
diseases like polio, diphtheria, pneumonia
and tetanus have been controlled by the use of
vaccines and by creating awareness among the people.

**7.3 Basic concepts of immunology**

Immunology is the study of immune
system. This system protects an indvidual
from various infective agents. It refers to
all the mechanisms used by the body for
protection from environmental agents that
are foreign to the body.
When the immune system does not
function efficiently in an individual, it leads to
infection causing disease. The overall ability
of body to fight against the disease causing
pathogen is called immunity. It is also called
disease resistance and the lack of immunity
is known as susceptibility. Immunity is highly
specific.
Normally many of the responses of the
immune system initiate the destruction and
elimination of invading organisms and any
toxic molecules produced by them. These
immune reactions are destructive in nature
and are made in response only to molecules
that are foreign to the host and not to those of
host itself. This ability to distinguish foreign
molecules from self is another fundamental
feature of the immune system. However,
occasionally, it fails to make its distinction
and reacts destructively against the host's
own molecules; such autoimmune diseases
can be fatal to the organism.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/flow2.png )

Almost all the macromolecules e.g.
proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids, etc., as long as they are foreign to recipient organism
can induce immune response. Any substance
capable of eliciting immune response is called
an ANTIGEN (ANTIbody GENerator). There
are two broad classes of immunity responses
namely, innate immunity and acquired
immunity (Fig. 7.9).

**7.3.1 Innate immunity**

Innate immunity is the natural
phenomenon of resistance to infection which
an individual possesses right from the birth.
The innate defense mechanisms are non-specific
in the sense that they are effective against a
wide range of potentially infectious agents. It is
otherwise known as non-specific immunity or
natural immunity.
A number of innate defense mechanisms are
operative non-specifically against a large number
of microorganisms as shown in the Table 7.4 and
Fig. 7.10.

**7.3.2 Acquired immunity**

The immunity that an individual acquires
after birth is known as acquired immunity.
It is the body's resistance to a specific pathogen.
The unique features of acquired immunity
are antigenic specificity, diversity, recognition of
self and non-self and immunological memory.

**Components of acquired immunity**

Acquired immunity has two components –
cell mediated immunity (CMI) and antibody
mediated immunity or humoral immunity.

**1. Cell mediated immunity**

When pathogens are destroyed by cells
without producing antibodies, then it is known as cell mediated immune response or cell
mediated immunity. This is brought about by
T cells, macrophages and natural killer cells
.
**2. Antibody mediated immunity or humoral immunity**

When pathogens are destroyed by the
production of antibodies, then it is known
as antibody mediated or humoral immunity.
This is brought about by B cells with the help
of antigen presenting cells and T helper cells.
Antibody production is the characteristic
feature of vertebrates only.

**Types of acquired immunity**

Acquired immunity may be active
immunity or passive immunity (Table 7.5).

</table>

The immunological resistance developed
by the organisms through the production
of antibodies in their body is called active
immunity. Active immunity is acquired through
the use of a person’s immune responses, which
lead to the development of memory cells.
Active immunity results from an infection or an
immunization.

Passive immunity does not require the
body to produce antibodies to antigens. The
antibodies are introduced from outside into the
organism. Thus, passive immunity is acquired
without the activation of a person’s immune
response, and therefore there is no memory.

**7.3.3 Immune responses**

The immune responses may be primary
or secondary (Table 7.6).

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/note3.6.png )

**Primary immune response**

The primary immune response occurs
when a pathogen comes in contact with the
immune system for the first time. During
this, the immune system has to learn to

recognize the antigen, produce antibody
against it and eventually produce memory
lymphocytes. The primary immune response
is slow and short-lived.

**Secondary immune response**

The secondary immune response occurs
when a person is exposed to the same antigen
again. During this time, immunological memory
has been established and the immune system
can start producing antibodies immediately.
Within hours after recognition of the antigen, a
new army of plasma cells are generated. Within
2 to 3 days, the antibody concentration in the
blood rises steeply to reach much higher level
than primary response. This is also called as
“booster response”.

**7.3.4 Lymphoid organs**

Immune system of an organism consists of
several structurally and functionally different
organs and tissues that are widely dispersed
in the body. The organs involved in the origin,
maturation and proliferation of lymphocytes
are called lymphoid organs (Fig. 7.11).
Based on their functions, they are classified
into primary or central lymphoid organs and
secondary or peripheral lymphoid organs. The
primary lymphoid organs provide appropriate
environment for lymphocytic maturation. The
secondary lymphoid organs trap antigens and
make it available for mature lymphocytes, which
can effectively fight against these antigens.

**Primary lymphoid organs**

Bursa of Fabricius of birds, bone marrow
and thymus gland of mammals constitute
the primary lymphoid organs involved
in the production and early selection of
lymphocytes. These lymphocytes become
dedicated to a particular antigenic specificity.
Only when the lymphocytes mature in the
primary lymphoidal organs, they become
immunocompetent cells. In mammals, B cell
maturation occurs in the bone marrow and
T cells maturation occurs in the thymus.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.8.png )

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.9.png )

**Thymus**

The thymus is a flat and bilobed organ
located behind the sternun, above the heart.
Each lobe of the thymus contains numerous
lobules, separated from each other by
connective tissue called septa. Each lobule is differentiated into two compartments,
the outer compartment or outer cortex, is
densely packed with immature T cells called
thymocytes, whereas the inner compartment
or medulla is sparsely populated with mature
thymocytes. One of its main secretions is the
hormone thymosin. It stimulates the T cell to
become mature and immunocompetent. By
the early teens, the thymus begins to atrophy
and is replaced by adipose tissue (Fig. 7.12).
Thus thymus is most active during the
neonatal and pre-adolescent periods.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.10.png )

**Bone marrow**

Bone marrow is a lymphoid tissue found
within the spongy portion of the bone.
Bone marrow contains stem cells known as
haematopoietic cells. These cells have the
potential to multiply through cell division
and either remain as stem cells or differentiate
and mature into different kinds of blood cells.

**Secondary or peripheral lymphoid organs**

In secondary or peripheral lymphoid
organs, antigen is localized so that it can be
effectively exposed to mature lymphocytes.
The best examples are lymph nodes,
appendix, Peyer’s patches of gastrointestinal
tract, tonsils, adenoids, spleen, MALT
(Mucosal-Associated Lymphoid Tissue),
GALT (Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue),
BALT (Bronchial/Tracheal-Associated
Lymphoid Tissue).

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/note3.7.png )

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/note3.8.png )

**Lymph node**

Lymph node is a small bean-shaped
structure and is part of the body’s immune
system. It is the first one to encounter
the antigen that enters the tissue spaces.
Lymph nodes filter and trap substances that
travel through the lymphatic fluid. They
are packed tightly with white blood cells,
namely lymphocytes and macrophages.
There are hundreds of lymph nodes found
throughout the body. They are connected to one another by lymph vessels. Lymph is
a clear, transparent, colourless, mobile and
extracellular fluid connective tissue. As the
lymph percolates through the lymph node,
the particulate antigen brought in by the
lymph will be trapped by the phagocytic cells,
follicular and interdigitating dendritic cells.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.11.png )

Lymph node has three zones (Fig. 7.13).
They are the cortex, paracortex and medulla.
The outer most layer of the lymph node is
called cortex, which consists of B-lymphocytes,
macrophages, and follicular dendritic cells.
The paracortex zone is beneath the cortex,
which is richly populated by T lymphocytes
and interdigitating dendritic cells. The inner
most zone is called the medulla which is
sparsely populated by lymphocytes, but many
of them are plasma cells, which actively
secrete antibody molecules. As the lymph
enters, it slowly percolates through the cortex,
paracortex and medulla, giving sufficient
chance for the phagocytic cells and dendritic
cells to trap the antigen brought by the lymph.
The lymph leaving a node carries enriched
antibodies secreted by the medullary plasma
cells against the antigens that enter the lymph
node. Sometimes visible swelling of lymph
nodes occurs due to active immune response
and increased concentration of lymphocytes.
Thus swollen lymph nodes may signal an
infection. There are several groups of lymph
nodes. The most frequently enlarged lymph
nodes are found in the neck, under the chin, in
the armpits and in the groin.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/note3.9.png )


**Cells of the immune system**

The immune system is composed of many
interdependent cells that protect the body from
microbial infections and the growth of tumour
cells. The cellular composition of adult human
blood is given in Table 7.7.

All these cells are derived from pluripotent
haematopoetic stem cells. Each stem cell has the
capacity to produce RBC, WBC and platelets.
The only cells capable of specifically recognising
and producing an immune response are the
lymphocytes. The other types of white blood cells
play an important role in non specific immune
response, antigen presentation and cytokine
production.

**Lymphocytes**

About 20-30% of the white blood cells are
lymphocytes. They have a large nucleus filling
most of the cell, surrounded by a little cytoplasm.
The two main types of lymphocytes are B and
T lymphocytes. Both these are produced in the
bone marrow. B lymphocytes (B cells) stay in the
bone marrow until they are mature. Then they
circulate around the body. Some remain in the
blood, while others accumulate in the lymph
nodes and spleen. T lymphocytes leave the bone
marrow and mature in the thymus gland. Once
mature, T cells also accumulate in the same areas
of the body as B cells. Lymphocytes have receptor
proteins on their surface. When receptors on a
B cell bind with an antigen, the B cell becomes
activated and divides rapidly to produce plasma
cells. The plasma cells produce antibodies. Some
B cells do not produce antibodies but become
memory cells. These cells are responsible for
secondary immune response. T lymphocytes do not produce antibodies. They recognize antigen- presenting cells and destroy them. The two important types of T cells are Helper T cells and Killer T cells. Helper T cells release a chemical

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.12.png )

called cytokine which activates B cells. Killer
cells move around the body and destroy cells
which are damaged or infected (Fig. 7.14).
Apart from these cells neutrophils and
monocytes destroy foreign cells by phagocytosis.
Monocytes when they mature into large cells,
they are called macrophages which perform
phagocytosis on any foreign organism.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/note3.10.png )


**7.3.5 Antigens**

The term antigen (Ag) is used in two
senses, the first to describe a molecule which
generates an immune response and the second,
a molecule which reacts with antibodies. In
general antigens are large, complex molecular
substances that can induce a detectable immune
response. Thus an antigen is a substance that is
specific to an antibody or a T-cell receptor and
is often used as a synonym for immunogen.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/note3.11.png )


An immunogen is a substance capable of
initiating an immune response. Haptens are
substance that are non-immunogenic but can react
with the products of a specific immune response.
Substances that can enhance the immune
response to an antigen are called adjuvants.
Epitope is an antigenic determinant and is the
active part of an antigen. A paratope is the antigen
– binding site and is a part of an antibody which
recognizes and binds to an antigen.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/note3.12.png )


**Types of antigens**

On the basis of origin, antigens are
classified into exogenous antigens and
endogenous antigens.
The antigens which enter the host from the
outside in the form of microorganisms, pollens,
drugs, or pollutants are called exogenous
antigens. The antigens which are formed within
the individual are endogenous antigens. The
best examples are blood group antigens.

**7.3.6 Antibodies**

Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig)
protein molecules synthesized on exposure
to antigen that can combine specifically
with the antigen. Whenever pathogens
enter our body, the B-lymphocytes produce
an army of proteins called antibodies to
fight with them. Thus, they are secreted in
response to an antigen (Ag) by the effect of
B cells called plasma cells. The antibodies
are classified into five major categories,
based on their physiological and biochemical
properties. They are IgG (gamma), IgM (mu),
IgA (alpha), IgD (delta) and IgE (epsilon).
In the 1950s, experiments by Porter and
Edelman revealed the basic structure of the
immunoglobulin. An antibody molecule
is Y shaped structure that comprises of
four polypeptide chains, two identical light
chains (L) of molecular weight 25,000 Da
(approximately 214 amino acids) and two
identical heavy chains (H) of molecular
weight 50,000 Da (approximately 450 amino
acids). The polypeptide chains are linked
together by di-sulphide (S-S) bonds. One
light chain is attached to each heavy chain
and two heavy chains are attached to each other to form a Y shaped (Fig. 7.15) structure.
Hence, an antibody is represented by H2 L2.
The heavy chains have a flexible hinge region
at their approximate middles.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.13.png )



Each chain (L and H) has two terminals. They are
C - terminal (Carboxyl) and amino or N-terminal.
Each chain (L and H) has two regions. They have
variable (V) region at one end and a much larger
constant (C) region at the other end. Antibodies
responding to different antigens have very different
(V) regions but their (C) regions are the same
in all antibodies. In each arm of the monomer
antibody, the (V) regions of the heavy and light
chains combines to form an antigen – binding site
shaped to ‘fit’ a specific antigenic determinant.
Consequently each antibody monomer has two
such antigen – binding regions. The (C) regions
that forms the stem of the antibody monomer
determine the antibody class and serve common
functions in all antibodies.

The functions of immunoglobulin are
agglutination, precipitation, opsonisation,
neutralization etc.,

**7.3.7. Antigen -antibody interaction**

The reaction between
an antigen and antibody
is the basis for humoral
immunity or antibody
mediated immunity. The
reaction between antigen and antibody occurs in three stages. During the
first stage, the reaction involves the formation
of antigen - antibody complex. The next
stage leads to visible events like precipitation,
agglutination, etc., The final stage includes
destruction of antigen or its neutralization
(Fig. 7.16).

**Binding force of antigen - antibody reaction**

The binding force between antigen and
antibody is due to three factors. They are
closeness between antigen and antibody, non-
covalent bonds or intermolecular forces and
affinity of antibody.
When antigen and antibody are closely
fitted, the strength of binding is great. When
they are apart binding strength is low. The
bonds that hold the antigen to the antibody
combining site are all non-covalent in nature.
These include hydrogen bonds, electrostatic
bonds, Van der Waals forces and hydrophobic
bonds. Antibody affinity is the strength of the
reaction between a single antigenic determinant
and a single combining site on the antibody.
The chief application of antigen - antibody
reactions are to determine blood groups for
transfusion, to study serological ascertainment
of exposure to infectious agents, to develop
immunoassays for the quantification of various
substances, to detect the presence or absence
of protein in serum and to determine the
characteristics of certain immunodeficiency
diseases.

**Different types of antigen and antibody reactions**

The reaction between soluble antigen
and antibody leads to visible precipitate
formation, which is called precipitin reaction.
Antibodies that bring about precipitate
formation on reacting with antigens are called
as precipitins.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/flow3.png )


Whenever a particulate antigen interacts
with its antibody, it would result in clumping or
agglutination of the particulate antigen, which
is called agglutination reaction. The antibody
involved in bringing about agglutination
reaction is called agglutinin.
Opsonisation or enhanced attachment
is the process by which a pathogen is marked
of ingestion and destruction by a phagocyte.
Opsonisation involves the binding of an
opsonin i.e., antibody, to a receptor on the
pathogen’s cell membrane. After opsonin
binds to the membrane, phagocytes are
attracted to the pathogen. So, opsonisation is
a process in which pathogens are coated with
a substance called an opsonin, marking the
pathogen out for destruction by the immune
system. This results in a much more efficient
phagocytosis.
The neutralization reactions are the
reactions of antigen-antibody that involve the elimination of harmful effects of bacterial
exotoxins or a virus by specific antibodies.
These neutralizing substances i.e., antibodies
are known as antitoxins. This specific
antibody is produced by a host cell in response
to a bacterial exotoxin or corresponding
toxoid (inactivated toxin).

**7.3.8 Vaccines**

A vaccine is a biological preparation
that provides active acquired immunity
to a particular disease and resembles a
disease-causing microorganism and is
often made from weakened or attenuated
or killed forms of the microbes, their
toxins, or one of its surface proteins.
Vaccines “teach” our body how to defend
itself when viruses or bacteria, invade it.
Vaccines deliver only very little amounts of
inactivated or weakened viruses or bacteria,
or parts of them. This allows the immune

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.14.png )

system to recognize the organism without
actually experiencing the disease. Some
vaccines need to be given more than once
(i.e., a ‘booster’ vaccination) to make sure
the immune system can overcome a real
infection in the future.
Vaccine initiates the immunization
process. The vaccines are classified as first,
second and third generation vaccines.
First generation vaccine is further
subdivided into live attenuated vaccine,
killed vaccine and toxoids (Fig. 8.9). Live
attenuated vaccines use the weakened
(attenuated), aged, less virulent form
of the virus. E.g. Measles, mumps and
rubella (MMR) vaccine and the Varicella
(chickenpox) vaccine, Killed (inactivated)
vaccines are killed or inactivated by heat
and other methods. E.g. Salk’s polio vaccine.
Toxoid vaccines contain a toxin or chemical
secreted by the bacteria or virus. They make
us immune to the harmful effects of the
infection, instead of to the infection itself.
E.g. DPT vaccine (Diphtheria, Pertussis
and Tetanus).
Second generation vaccine contains
the pure surface antigen of the pathogen.
E.g.Hepatitis-B vaccine. Third generation
vaccine contains the purest and the highest potency vaccines which are synthetic in
generation. The latest revolution in vaccine
is DNA vaccine or recombinant vaccine
(Refer Chapter- 9 for details).

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/note3.13.png )


**7.3.9 Vaccination and immunization**

“Vaccination is the process of
administrating a vaccine into the body or the act
of introducing a vaccine into the body to produce
immunity to a specific disease.” Immunization
is the process of the body building up immunity
to a particular disease. Immunization describes
the actual changes in the body after receiving a
vaccine. Vaccines work by fighting the pathogen
and then recording it in their memory system to ensure that the next time this pathogen enters the body, it is eliminated far quickly. Once, the
body is able to fight against the disease, it is
believed to have built the immunity for it, also
known as the body being immunized against
the disease.

**7.3.10 Hypersensitivity**

Some of the individuals are very sensitive
to some particles present in the environment.
The exaggerated response of the immune
system to certain antigens present in the
environment is called allergy (allo-altered,
erg-reaction). The substances to which such
an immune response is produced are called
allergens. An allergen is an antigen that
causes an allergic reaction. Allergic reactions
begin within few seconds after the contact
with the allergen and last about half an hour.
The common examples of allergens are mites
in dust, pollens and some proteins in insect
venom. Hay fever and asthma are some
common examples of allergy. Symptoms of
allergic reactions include sneezing, watery
eyes, running nose and difficulty in breathing.
Allergy is a form of over active immune
response mediated by IgE and mast cells. It
can also be due to the release of chemicals like
histamine and serotonin from the mast cells.
Anaphylaxis is the classical immediate
hypersensitivity reaction. It is a sudden, systematic,
severe and immediate hypersensitivity reaction
occurring as a result of rapid generalized mast-cell
degranulation.

**7.4 Immunodeficiency diseases**

Immunodeficiency results from the
failure of one or more components of the
immune system. Primary immune deficiencies
are caused by genetic developmental defects.
Secondary immune deficiencies arise due to
various reasons like radiation, use of cytolytic
and immunosuppressive drugs and infections.
AIDS is an acronym for Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome. It is the deficiency
of immune system, acquired during the life
time of an individual indicating that it is
not a congenital disease. AIDS is caused by
Human Immuno Deficiency Virus (HIV). It
selectively infects helper T cells. The infected
helper T cells will not stimulate antibody
production by B-cells resulting in loss of
natural defence against viral infection. On the
basis of genetic characteristics and differences
in the viral antigens, HIV is classified into the
types 1 and 2 (HIV-1, HIV-2).

**Structure of HIV**

The human immunodeficiency
virus belongs to the genus Lentivirus.
When observed under the electron
microscope, HIV is seen as a spherical virus,
100-120 nm in diameter, containing a dense
core surrounded by a lipoprotein envelope. The
envelope has glycoprotein (gp) spikes termed
gp 41 and gp 120. At the core, there are two
large single stranded RNA. Attached to the
RNA are molecules of reverse transcriptase.
It also contains enzymes like protease and
ribonuclease. The core is covered by a capsid
made of proteins. This is followed by another
layer of matrix proteins as shown in the
Fig 7.18.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.15.png )


**HIV Transmission**

The HIV is often located within the
cells especially in macrophages. HIV can survive for 1.5 days inside a cell but only
about 6 hours outside a cell. Routes of HIV
transmission include unsafe sexual contact,
blood-contaminated needles, organ
transplants, blood transfusion and vertical
transmission from HIV infected mother to
child. HIV is not transmitted by insects or
by casual contact.
After getting into the body of the person,
the virus enters into macrophages where RNA
genome of the virus replicates to form viral
DNA with the help of the enzyme reverse
transcriptase. This viral DNA gets incorporated
into the DNA of host cells and directs the infected
cells to produce viral particles. The macrophages
continue to produce virus and in this way acts like
a HIV factory. Simultaneously, HIV enters into
helper T-lymphocytes, replicates and produces
progeny viruses. The progeny viruses released
in the blood attack other helper T-lymphocytes.
This is repeated, leading to a progressive decrease
in the number of helper T lymphocytes in the
body of the infected person. During this period,
the person suffers from bouts of fever, diarrhoea
and weight loss. Due to decrease in the number of
helper T lymphocytes, the person starts suffering
from infections and becomes immune deficient
and unable to protect against any infection.
A simple blood test is available that can
determine whether the person has been infected
with HIV. The ELISA test (Enzyme Linked
ImmunoSorbent Assay) detects the presence of
HIV antibodies. It is a preliminary test. Western
blot test is more reliable and a confirmatory
test. It detects the viral core proteins. If both
tests detect the presence of the antibodies, the
person is considered to be HIV positive.
AIDS has no cure. Prevention of AIDS
is the best option. Advocating safe sex and
promoting regular check-up, safe blood for
transfusion, use of disposable needles, use of
condoms during sexual contact, prevention of
drug abuse, AIDS awareness programme by
NACO (National AIDS Control Organisation),
NGOs (Non-Governmental Organisations) and
WHO are to prevent the spreading of AIDS.

**7.5 Autoimmune diseases**

Autoimmunity is due to an abnormal
immune response in which the immune system
fails to properly distinguish between self and
non-self and attacks its own body. Our body
produces antibodies (auto antibodies) and
cytotoxic T cells that destroy our own tissues.
If a disease-state results, it is referred to as
auto-immune disease. Thus, autoimmunity is a
misdirected immune response. Autoimmunity
is evidenced by the presence of auto antibodies
and T cells that are reactive with host antigens.
When the cells act as antigens in the same body,
they are called autoantigens.
Autoimmune diseases in human can be
divided into two broad categories, namely organ-
specific and non-organ-specific (systemic)
autoimmune diseases. In organ-specific disease,
the autoimmune process is directed mostly
against one organ. The autoantibodies may
block the functions performed by the organs.
Examples include Hashimoto’s thyroiditis,
Graves’ disease (thyroid gland) and Addison’s
disease (adrenal glands).
In non-organ specific (systemic) disorders,
autoimmune activity is widely spread throughout
the body. Rheumatoid arthritis and multiple
sclerosis are example for systemic disorder.

**7.5.1 Tumour immunology**

A tumour or neoplasm is a group of cells
whose growth has gone unchecked. When a
tumour continues to grow and invades healthy
tissue, it is called cancer. They spread to other
parts of the body from the tumour and give rise to
secondary tumour. This is known as metastasis.
Tumour may be benign or malignant depending
on its characteristics. Benign or non-cancerous
tissues are capable of indefinite growth and do

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/table1.png )

not invade other body parts. In the malignant
tumour, the cells grow indefinitely, detach and
migrate into healthy surrounding tissues.
In normal cells, cell growth and differentiation
is highly controlled and regulated. But in cancer
cells, there is breakdown of this regulatory
mechanism. Normal cells show a property called
contact inhibition, which inhibits uncontrolled
growth. Cancer cells do not have this property. As
a result, cancerous cells divide continuously giving
rise to mass of tissues called tumours (Table 7.8).
When a cell undergoes malignant
transformation, it acquires new surface antigen
and may also lose some normal antigens.
These antigens are present on the membranes
of malignant cells and they induce an immune
response. Both humoral and cellular responses
can be observed in malignancy. Cancer cells can
avoid immune detection as they are not foreign
bodies but are abnormally functioning body
cells. This makes them difficult to treat.
The concept of immunological surveillance
postulates that the primary function of the
immune system is to “seek and destroy”
malignant cells that arise by somatic mutation.
The efficiency of the surveillance mechanism reduces either as a result of ageing or due to congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies,
leads to increased incidence of cancer. Thus, if
immunological surveillance is effective, cancer
should not occur. The development of tumour
represents a lapse in surveillance.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/note3.14.png )


**Immunotherapy of cancer**

Immunotherapy also called biological
therapy uses substances made by the body
or in a laboratory (monoclonal antibodies)
to improve or to resist the immune system
function. Different approaches have been
attempted in the immunotherapy of cancer.
Immunotherapy appears to be important in getting rid of the residual malignant cells after
the gross tumour has been removed. The best
results in the treatment of cancer is to follow
an integrated approach to therapy, combining
surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and
immunotherapy.

**7.6 Adolescence – drug and alcohol abuse**

Adolescence begins with a period of rapid
physical and sexual development called puberty
to maturity at 12 to 19 years of age. Adolescence
is also a highly dynamic period of psychological
and social changes in individuals. Adolescents
are vulnerable to group (peer) pressure and
many youngsters are pushed into experimenting
with drugs and alcohol. Proper education and
guidance would enable youth to say no to drugs
and alcohol and to follow a healthy life style.
Alcohol is a psychoactive drug, which
acts on the brain, affecting a person’s mind and
behaviour. It is a depressant, which slows down
the activity of the nervous system. The intake
of certain drugs for a purpose other than their
normal clinical use in an amount and frequency
that impair one’s physical, physiological and
psychological functions is called drug abuse.

The drugs which are commonly abused
include opioids, cannabinoids, coca-alkaloids,
barbiturates, amphetamines and LSD.
Opioids are drugs which bind to specific
opioid receptors present in the central nervous
system and intestinal tract. Heroin (smack) is
chemically diacetyl morphine, which is white,
odourless and bitter crystalline compound. It
is obtained by acetylation of morphine, which
is extracted from flowers of the poppy plant
(Fig. 7.19). Morphine is one of the strongest
pain killer and is used during surgery. It is the
most widely abused narcotic drug which acts as
a depressant and slows down body functions.
Cannabinoids are a group of chemicals
obtained from Cannabis sativa, the Indian hemp
plant (Fig. 7.20). Natural cannabinoids are
the main source of marijuana, ganja, hashish
and charas. It interferes in the transport of the
neurotransmitter, dopamine and has a potent
stimulating action on the CNS, producing
increased energy and a sense of euphoria.

Cocaine is a white powder that is obtained
from the leaves of the coca plant, Erythroxylum
coca. It is commonly called coke or crack. Cocaine
causes serious physical and psychological
problems including hallucinations and
paranoia. The other plants with hallucinogenic
properties are Atropa belladonna and Datura
(Fig. 7.21 and Fig. 7.22).


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/bzf3.18.png )



Drugs like methamphetamine,
amphetamines, barbiturates, tranquilizers,
Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are
normally used as medicine to treat patients
with mental illness like depression and
insomnia and are often abused.
Tobacco is smoked, chewed and
used as snuff. It increases the carbon
monoxide content of blood and reduces
the concentration of haem bound oxygen,
thus causing oxygen deficiency in the body.
Tobacco contains nicotine, carbon monoxide
and tars, which cause problems in the heart, lung and nervous system. Adrenal glands are
stimulated by nicotine to release adrenaline
and nor adrenaline which increases blood
pressure and heart beat.

**7.6.1 Addiction and dependence**

Addiction is a physical or psychological
need to do or take or use certain substance
such as alcohol, to the point where it could
be harmful to the individual. This addictive
behaviour can be personally destructive to
a person. Overtime addicts start to lose not
only their jobs, homes and money, but also
friendship, family relationships and contact
with the normal world. Addiction to drugs
and alcohol can lead to a psychological
attachment to certain effects such as euphoria
and temporary feeling of well being.
Repeated use of drugs and alcohol may
affect the tolerance level of the receptors
present in the body. These receptors then
respond only to highest doses of drugs and
alcohol leading to greater intake and addiction.
Excessive use of drug and alcohol leads to
physical and psychological dependence.
When psychological dependence develops,
the drug user gets mentally ‘hooked on’ to
the drug. The drug user constantly thinks
only about the drug and has continuous
uncontrollable craving for it. This state called
“euphoria” is characterized by mental and
emotional preoccupation with the drug.
Physical dependence is a state in which
the user’s body requires a continuous presence
of the drug. If the intake of the drug or alcohol
is abruptly stopped, he or she would develop
withdrawal symptoms. In a sense, the body
becomes confused and protests against the
absence of the drug. The withdrawal symptoms
may range from mild tremors to convulsions,
severe agitation and fits, depressed mood, anxiety,
nervousness, restlessness, irritability, insomnia,
dryness of throat, etc, depending on the type of
drug abuse.


**7.6.2 Effects of drugs and alcohol**

Short-term effect appears only for a few
minutes after the intake of drugs and alcohol.
The abuser feels a false sense of well being
and a pleasant drowsiness. Some short term
effects are euphoria, pain, dullness of senses,
alteration in behaviour, blood pressure, narcosis
(deep sleep), nausea and vomiting.
Drugs and alcohol have long-term effect
that lead to serious damages, because of the
constant and excessive use. The physical and
mental disturbance makes the life of the user
unbearable and torturous. For example heavy
drinking permanently damages the liver
and brain.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/note3.15.png )



The use of alcohol during adolescence may
have long-term effects. Alcohol interferes with
the ability of the liver to break down fat. Over
time fat accumulation and high levels of alcohol
destroy the liver cells and a scar tissue grows in
the place of dead cells. This scarring of the liver
is called “Liver cirrhosis”. Alcohol irritates the
stomach lining due to the production of excess
acid leading to ulcers. Excessive alcohol use
weakens the heart muscle, causing scar tissue
to build up in the cardiac muscle fibers. As a
result, heavy drinkers have an increased risk
of high blood pressure, stroke, coronary artery disease and heart attack. Korsakoff syndrome,
a chronic memory disorder is most commonly
caused by alcohol misuse.
7.6.3 Prevention and control
It is practically possible to prevent some
one from using drugs and alcohol. Here are
some ways that help to prevent drug and
alcohol abuse.

**1. Effectively dealing with peer pressure**

The biggest reason for teens to start on drugs
is due to their friends / peer groups imposing
pressure on them. Hence, it is important to have
a better group of friends to avoid such harmful
drugs and alcohol.

**2. Seeking help from parents and peers**

Help from parents and peer group should
be sought immediately so that they can be
guided appropriately. Help may even be sought
from close and trusted friends. Getting proper
advice to sort out their problems would help
the young to vent their feelings of anxiety
and guilt.

**3. Education and counselling**

Education and counselling create positive
attitude to deal with many problems and to
accept disappointments in life.

**4. Looking for danger signs**

Teachers and parents need to look for sign
that indicate tendency to go in for addiction.

**5. Seeking professional and medical assistance**

Assistance is available in the form of
highly qualified psychologists, psychiatrists and
de-addiction and rehabilitation programmes to
help individuals to overcome their problems.


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit3/note3.16.png )


**7.7 Mental health – Depression**

Mental health is a state of well being of
the mind, with self esteem. Self esteem means
liking yourself and being able to stand up
for what you believe is right. Positive mental
health is an important part of wellness. A
mentally healthy person reflects a good
personality. Activities of mentally healthy
people are always appreciated and rewarded
by the society as these persons are creative as
well as cooperative with others. Mental health
improves the quality of life.
Depression is a common mental disorder
that causes people to experience depressed
mood, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of
guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep poor
appetite, low energy and poor concentration.

**Signs and symptoms of mental depression**

1.Loss of self confidence and self esteem

2. Anxiety

3.Not being able to enjoy things that are
usually pleasurable or interesting
Lifestyle changes like exercise,
meditation, yoga and healthy food habits can
help to be relieved from depression. Exercise
stimulates the body to produce serotonin and
endorphins, which are neurotransmitters
that suppress depression. Practicing exercise
in daily life creates a positive attitude .
Participating in an exercise programme can:

4.Increase self-esteem

5.Boost self-confidence

6.Create a sense of empowerment

7.Enhance social connections and
relationships
Brain is one of the most metabolically active
part of the body and needs a steady stream
of nutrients to function. A poor diet may
not provide the nutrients for a healthy body
and may provoke symptoms of anxiety and
depression.

**Summary**

Health is a state of complete physical
and psychological well being. Many other
extended factors like microbes may cause
illness to human body. Protozoans like
Entamoeba, Plasmodium and Leishmania
cause diseases such as amoebic dysentery,
malaria and kala-azar repectively. Personal
cleanliness and hygiene, proper disposal of
waste, safe drinking water and immunization
are very useful in preventing diseases. Drug
and alcohol abuse of young and adolescent
is another cause of concern. Addiction
to drugs and alcohol is happening due to
peer pressure, examination–related and
competition–related stresses. The addicted
person should receive proper counselling,
education and professional medical help
to liberate themselves from all forms of
addiction.
Immunology deals with a study of the immune
system. The immune system recognises and
eliminates the invaders, and the ability of
the body to overcome the pathogen is called
immunity. Immunity is classified into innate
immunity and acquired immunity. Acquired
immunity is further classified into cell mediated
immunity and antibody mediated immunity as
its components. Acquired immunity may be
active or passive immunity. Immune response
is the body’s response to pathogens and it may
be primary or secondary. The organs involved
in the origin, maturation and proliferation
of lymphocytes are called lymphoid organs.
Thymus, bone marrow are primary lymphoid
organs. The secondary lymphoid organs are
lymph node, MALT, GALT and BALT.
The malfunctioning of immune system
leads to hypersensitivity, immunodeficiency or
autoimmune diseases. A tumour or neoplasm
is a group of cells whose growth has gone
unchecked. The best results in the treatment of
cancer is achieved by an integrated approach to
therapy, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy
and immunotherapy.
