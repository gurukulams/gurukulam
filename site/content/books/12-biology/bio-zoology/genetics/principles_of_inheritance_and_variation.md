Genetics is a branch of biology that deals
with the study of heredity and variations. It
describes how characteristics and features pass
on from the parents to their offsprings in each
successive generation. The unit of heredity is
known as the gene. Gene is the inherited factor
that determines the biological character of an
organism. A variation is the degree by which
the progeny differs from their parents.
In this chapter, we are going to learn about
multiple alleles with reference to the human
blood groups, sex determination in man, insects
and birds, sex linked inherited traits and genetic
disorders.

##### <u> 4.1 Multiple alleles </u>

The genetic segregations in Mendelian
inheritance reveal that all genes have two
alternative forms – dominant and recessive
alleles e.g. tall versus dwarf (T and t). The
former is the normal allele or wild allele and
the latter the mutant allele. A gene can mutate
several times producing several alternative
forms. When three or more alleles of a gene
that control a particular trait occupy the same
locus on the homologous chromosome of an
organism, they are called multiple alleles and
their inheritance is called **multiple allelism.**

##### <u> 4.2 Human Blood Groups </u>

Multiple allelism occurs in humans,
particularly in the inheritance of different types
of blood groups. The blood group inheritance
in human can be understood by learning about
antigens and antibodies. The composition of
blood, different types of blood groups (ABO) the
blood antigens and antibodies were discussed
in chapter 7 of class XI.

##### <u> 4.2.1 ABO blood types </u>

**Multiple allele inheritance of ABO blood groups**

Blood differs chemically from person
to person. When two different incompatible
blood types are mixed, agglutination
(clumping together) of erythrocytes
(RBC) occurs. The basis of these chemical
differences is due to the presence of antigens
(surface antigens) on the membrane of
RBC and epithelial cells. Karl Landsteiner
discovered two kinds of antigens called
antigen ‘A’ and antigen ‘B’ on the surface
of RBC’s of human blood. Based on the
presence or absence of these antigens three
kinds of blood groups, type ‘A’, type ‘B’, and
type ‘O’ (universal donor)were recognized.
The fourth and the rarest blood group ‘AB’
(universal recipient) was discovered in 1902
by two of Landsteiner’s students Von De
Castelle and Sturli.

Bernstein in 1925 discovered that the
inheritance of different blood groups in
human beings is determined by a number
of multiple allelic series. The three
autosomal alleles located on chromosome 9
are concerned with the determination of
blood group in any person. The gene
controlling blood type has been labeled as
‘L’ (after the name of the discoverer,
Landsteiner) or I (from isoagglutination).
The I gene exists in three allelic forms, IA, IB
and IO. IA specifies A antigen. IB allele
determines B antigen and IO allele specifies
no antigen. Individuals who possess these
antigens in their fluids such as the saliva
are called secretors.

Each allele (IA and IB) produces a
transferase enzyme. IA allele produces
N-acetyl galactose transferase and can add
N-acetyl galactosamine (NAG) and IB allele
encodes for the enzyme galactose transferase
that adds galactose to the precursor
(i.e., H substances) In the case of IO/IO allele
no terminal transferase enzyme is produced
and therefore called “null” allele and hence
cannot add NAG or galactose to the precursor.

From the phenotypic combinations it is
evident that the alleles IA and IB are dominant
to IO, but co-dominant to each other (I<sup>A</sup>=I<sup>B</sup>).
Their dominance hierarchy can be given
as (I<sup>A</sup> =I<sup>B</sup> > I<sup>0</sup>). A child receives one of three
alleles from each parent, giving rise to six
possible genotypes and four possible blood
types (phenotypes). The genotypes are I<sup>A</sup>, I<sup>A</sup>, I<sup>A</sup> ,I<sup>O</sup>, I<sup>B</sup>I<sup>B</sup>, I<sup>B</sup>,
 I<sup>O</sup>, I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>B</sup> and I<sup>O</sup> I<sup>0</sup>.

 #### DO YOU KNOW ??

 Antigens similar
to those found among
human beings have been
recognized in the blood
of other organisms.

A-type antigens have been found in
chimpanzees and in gibbons, A, B and
AB antigen in orangutans.

*  New world monkeys (Platyrrhina) and
lemurs have a substance similar but not
identical with B antigen in humans.


* Three blood groups have been
distinguished in cats with a genetic
system similar to those in humans.


*  The secretors (antigens found in the
body fluids) can be detected in tears,
saliva, urine, semen, gastric juice and
in the milk of animals.

![Table 4.1 Genetic basis of the human ABO blood groups](/books/12-biology/Zoology/pic1.png )

#### <u> Rhesus or Rh Factor </u>

The Rh factor or Rh antigen is found on
the surface of erythrocytes. It was discovered
in 1940 by Karl Landsteiner and Alexander
Wiener in the blood of rhesus monkey,
Macaca rhesus and later in human beings.
The term ‘Rh factor’ refers to “immunogenic
D antigen of the Rh blood group system. An
individual having D antigen are Rh D positive
(Rh+
) and those without D antigen are Rh D
negative (Rh-

)”. Rhesus factor in the blood
is inherited as a dominant trait. Naturally
occurring Anti D antibodies are absent in the
plasma of any normal individual. However if
an Rh-
(Rh negative) person is exposed to Rh+
(Rh positive) blood cells (erythrocytes) for
the first time, anti D antibodies are formed
in the blood of that individual. On the other
hand, when an Rh positive person receives Rh
negative blood no effect is seen.

#### <u>4.3 Genetic control of Rh factor</u>

**Fisher and Race hypothesis:**

Fisher and Race hypothesis:
Rh factor involves three different pairs of
alleles located on three different closely linked
loci on the chromosome pair. This system is
more commonly in use today, and uses the 'Cde'
nomenclature.

![Fig. 4.1 Fischer and Race hypothesis](/books/12-biology/Zoology/pic2.png )

In the above Fig. 4.1, three pairs of Rh alleles
(Cc, Dd and Ee) occur at 3 different loci on
homologous chromosome pair. The possible
genotypes will be one C or c, one D or d, one
E or e from each chromosome. For e.g. CDE/
cde; CdE/cDe; cde/cde; CDe/CdE etc., All
genotypes carrying a dominant ‘D’ allele will
produce Rh positive phenotype and double
recessive genotype ‘dd’ will give rise to Rh
negative phenotype.

#### <u> Wiener Hypothesis </u>

Wiener proposed the existence of eight alleles (R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>, R<sup>0</sup> ,R<sup>z</sup>,r, r<sup>1</sup>, r<sup>11</sup>, r<sup>y</sup>) at a single Rh locus. All genotypes carrying a dominant ‘R allele’ (R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>, R<sup>0</sup> ,R<sup>z</sup>) will produce Rh
will produce Rh positive phenotype and double recessive genotypes (rr, r<sup>1</sup>r<sup>1</sup>, r<sup>11</sup>r<sup>11</sup>, r<sup>y</sup>r<sup>y</sup>) will give rise to Rh negative phenotype.

#### <u> 4.3.1 Incompatibility of Rh Factor – Erythroblastosis foetalis  </u>

Rh incompatability has great significance
in child birth. If a woman is Rh negative and
the man is Rh positive, the foetus may be
Rh positive having inherited the factor from
its father. The Rh negative mother becomes
sensitized by carrying Rh positive foetus within
her body. Due to damage of blood vessels,
during child birth, the mother’s immune
system recognizes the Rh antigens and gets
sensitized. The sensitized mother produces Rh
antibodies. The antibodies are IgG type which
are small and can cross placenta and enter the
foetal circulation. By the time the mother gets
sensitized and produce anti ‘D’ antibodies, the
child is delivered.


Usually no effects are associated with
exposure of the mother to Rh positive antigen
during the first child birth, subsequent Rh
positive children carried by the same mother,
may be exposed to antibodies produced by
the mother against Rh antigen, which are
carried across the placenta into the foetal
blood circulation. This causes haemolysis of
foetal RBCs resulting in haemolytic jaundice
and anaemia. This condition is known as
Erythoblastosis foetalis or **Haemolytic disease of the new born (HDN)**.

### <u> Prevention of Erythroblastosis foetalis </u>

If the mother is Rh negative and foetus
is Rh positive, anti D antibodies should be
administered to the mother at 28th and 34th
week of gestation as a prophylactic measure.
If the Rh negative mother delivers Rh
positive child then anti D antibodies should
be administered to the mother soon after
delivery. This develops passive immunity and
prevents the formation of anti D antibodies in
the mothers blood by destroying the Rh foetal
RBC before the mother’s immune system is
sensitized. This has to be done whenever the
woman attains pregnancy.

#### <u> 4.4 Sex Determination </u>

Sex determination is the method by
which the distinction between male and
female is established in a species. Sex
chromosomes determine the sex of the
individual in dioecious or unisexual
organisms. The chromosomes other than the
sex chromosomes of an individual are called
autosomes. Sex chromosomes may be similar
(homomorphic) in one sex and dissimilar
(heteromorphic) in the other. Individuals
having homomorphic sex chromosomes
produce only one type of gametes
(homogametic) whereas heteromorphic
individuals produce two types of gametes
(heterogametic).

{{< box title="Do You Know ?? " type="objective" >}}

**Y CHROMOSOME**

The human Y chromosome
is only 60 Mb in size with
60 functional genes whereas
X chromosomes are 165 Mb in size with
about 1,000 genes.

{{< /box >}}

### <u> Chromosomal basis of sex determination Heterogametic Sex Determination: </u>

In heterogametic sex
determination one of the
sexes produces similar
gametes and the other
sex produces dissimilar gametes. The sex of
the offspring is determined at the time of
fertilization.


### <u> Heterogametic Males </u>

In this method of sex determination the
males are heterogametic producing dissimilar
gametes while females are homogametic
producing similar gametes. It is of two kinds
XX-XO type (e.g. Bugs, cockroaches and
grasshoppers) and XX-XY type (e.g. Human
beings and Drosophila).


### <u>Heterogametic Females </u>

In this method of sex determination the
females are heterogametic producing dissimilar
gametes while males are homogametic
producing similar gametes. To avoid
confusion with the XX-XO and XX-XY types
of sex determination, the alphabets ‘Z’ and ‘W’
are used here instead of X and Y respectively.
Heterogametic females are of two types,
ZO-ZZ type (eg. Moths, butterflies and
domestic chickens) and ZW-ZZ type
(eg. Gypsy moth, fishes, reptiles and birds).

### <u> Sex determination in human beings </u> 

Genes determining sex in human beings are
located on two sex chromosomes, called
allosomes. In mammals, sex determination is
associated with chromosomal differences
between the two sexes, typically XX females and
XY males. 23 pairs of human chromosomes
include 22 pairs of autosomes (44A) and one pair
of sex chromosomes (XX or XY). Females are
homogametic producing only one type of gamete
(egg), each containing one X chromosome while
the males are heterogametic producing two types
of sperms with X and Y chromosomes. An
independently evolved XX: XY system of sex
chromosomes also exist in *Drosophila*

![Fig. 4.2 Sex determination in human beings](/books/12-biology/Zoology/pic3.png )

### <u> The Y Chromosome and Male Development </u> 

Current analysis of Y chromosomes has
revealed numerous genes and regions with
potential genetic function; some genes with
or without homologous counterparts are
seen on the X. Present at both ends of the
Y chromosome are the pseudoautosomal regions
(PARs) that are similar with regions on the
X chromosome which synapse and recombine
during meiosis. The remaining 95% of the
Y chromosome is referred as the
Non - combining Region of the Y (NRY). The
NRY is divided equally into functional genes
(euchromatic) and non functional genes
(heterochromatic). Within the euchromatin
regions, is a gene called **Sex determining region Y (SRY)**. In humans, absence of
Y chromosome inevitably leads to female
development and this SRY gene is absent in
X chromosome. The gene product of SRY is the
testes determining factor (TDF) present in the
adult male testis.

#### <u> 4.4.1 Dosage compensation - Barr body </u> 

In 1949, Barr and Bertram first observed a
condensed body in the nerve cells of female cat
which was absent in the male. This condensed
body was called sex chromatin by them and
was later referred as Barr body. In the XY
chromosomal system of sex determination,
males have only one X chromosome, whereas
females have two. A question arises: how does
the organism compensate for this dosage
differences between the sexes? In mammals the
necessary dosage compensation is accomplished
by the inactivation of one of the X chromosome
in females so that both males and females have
only one functional X chromosome per cell.


Mary Lyon suggested that Barr bodies
represented an inactive chromosome, which
in females becomes tightly coiled into a
heterochromatin, a condensed and visible form
of chromatin (Lyon’s hypothesis). The number
of Barr bodies observed in cell was one less than
the number of X-Chromosome. XO females
have no Barr body, whereas XXY males have
one Barr body.

* **The number of Barr bodies follows N-1 rule (N minus one rule), where N is the total number of X chromosomes present.**

### <u> Haplodiploidy in Honeybees </u> 

In hymenopteran insects such as
honeybees, ants and wasps a mechanism of sex
determination called haplodiploidy mechanism
of sex determination is common. In this
system, the sex of the offspring is determined
by the number of sets of chromosomes it
receives. Fertilized eggs develop into females
(Queen or Worker) and unfertilized eggs
develop into males (drones) by parthenogenesis.
It means that the males have half the number
of chromosomes (haploid) and the females
have double the number (diploid), hence the
name haplodiplody for this system of sex
determination.

This mode of sex determination facilitates
the evolution of sociality in which only one
diploid female becomes a queen and lays the
eggs for the colony. All other females which are
diploid having developed from fertilized eggs
help to raise the queen’s eggs and so contribute
to the queen’s reproductive success and
indirectly to their own, a phenomenon known
as **Kin Selection**. The queen constructs their
social environment by releasing a hormone that
suppresses fertility of the workers.

### <u>4.5 Sex Linked Inheritance </u> 

The inheritance of a
trait that is determined
by a gene located on one
of the sex chromosomes
is called sex linked
inheritance. Genes present
on the differential region of
X or Y chromosomes are called sex linked
genes. The genes present in the differential
region of “X” chromosome are called
X linked genes. The X–linked genes have no
corresponding alleles in the Y chromosome.
The genes present in the differential region
of Y chromosome are called Y- linked or
**holandric genes.** The Y linked genes have no
corresponding allele in X chromosome. The
Y linked genes inherit along with
Y chromosome and they phenotypically express
only in the male sex. Sex linked inherited
traits are more common in males than females
because, males are hemizygous and therefore
express the trait when they inherit one mutant
allele. The X – linked and Y – linked genes
in the differential region (non–homologus
region) do not undergo pairing or crossing
over during meiosis. The inheritance of X or
Y linked genes is called sex-linked inheritance.

#### <u>4.5.1 Inheritance of X - linked genes </u> 

Red-green colour blindness or daltonism,
haemophilia and Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy
are examples of X-linked gene inheritance in
humans.

#### <u>1. Haemophilia </u>

Haemophilia is commonly known as
bleeder’s disease, which is more common in
men than women. This hereditary disease
was first reported by John Cotto in 1803.
Haemophilia is caused by a recessive X-linked
gene. A person with a recessive gene for
haemophilia lacks a normal clotting substance
(thromboplastin) in blood, hence minor
injuries cause continuous bleeding, leading to
death. The females are carriers of the disease
and would transmit the disease to 50% of
their sons even if the male parent is normal.
Haemophilia follows the characteristic
criss - cross pattern of inheritance.


#### <u> 2. Colour blindness </u>


In human beings a dominant X – linked
gene is necessary for the formation of colour
sensitive cells, the cones. The recessive form
of this gene is incapable of producing colour
sensitive cone cells. Homozygous recessive
females (X<sup>c</sup>X<sup>c</sup>) and hemizygous recessive males
(X<sup>c</sup>Y) are unable to distinguish red and green
colour. The inheritance of colour blindness
can be studied in the following two types of
marriages.

**(i) Marriage between colour blind man**
**and normal visioned woman**


A marriage between a colour blind man
and a normal visioned woman will produce
normal visioned male and female individuals
in F1 generation but the females are carriers.
The marriage between a F1 normal visioned
carrier woman and a normal visioned male
will produce one normal visioned female,
one carrier female, one normal visioned male
and one colour blind male in F2 generation.
Colour blind trait is inherited from the
male parent to his grandson through carrier
daughter, which is an example of criss-cross
pattern of inheritance (Fig. 4.3).

![Fig. 4.3 Marriage between colour blind man and normal visioned woman](/books/12-biology/Zoology/pic4.png )

**ii) Marriage between normal visioned man and colour blind woman**

If a colour blind woman (X<sup>c</sup>X<sup>c</sup>)
marries a normal visioned male (X+Y), all
F<sub>1</sub> sons will be colourblind and daughters will
be normal visioned but are carriers.


Marriage between F<sub>1</sub>carrier female with a
**colour blind** male will produce normal visioned
carrier daughter, colourblind daughter, normal
visioned son and a colourblind son in the
F2 generation **(Fig. 4.4)**.

![Fig. 4.4 Marriage between normal visioned man and colour blind woman](/books/12-biology/Zoology/pic5.png )

### <u> 4.5.2 Inheritance of Y- linked genes </u> 

Genes in the non-homologous region
of the Y-chromosome are inherited directly
from male to male. In humans, the Y-linked or
holandric genes for hypertrichosis (excessive
development of hairs on pinna of the ear) are
transmitted directly from father to son, because
males inherit the Y chromosome from the
father. Female inherits only X chromosome
from the father and are not affected.


### <u>4.6 Karyotyping </u> 

Karyotyping is a technique through which
a complete set of chromosomes is separated
from a cell and the chromosomes are arranged
in pairs. An idiogram refers to a diagrammatic
representation of chromosomes.

**Preparation of Karyotype**

Tjio and Levan (1960) described a simple
method of culturing lymphocytes from the
human blood. Mitosis is induced followed by
addition of colchicine to arrest cell division
at metaphase stage and the suitable spread of
metaphase chromosomes is photographed.
The individual chromosomes are cut from the
photograph and are arranged in an orderly
fashion in homologous pairs. This arrangement
is called a **karyotype.** Chromosome banding
permits structural definitions and differentiation
of chromosomes.

### <u> Applications of Karyotyping: </u> 

* It helps in gender identification.

* It is used to detect the chromosomal
aberrations like deletion, duplication,
translocation, nondisjunction of
chromosomes.

* It helps to identify the abnormalities of
chromosomes like aneuploidy.

* It is also used in predicting the evolutionary
relationships between species.

* Genetic diseases in human beings can be
detected by this technique.


![Fig. 4.5 Human karyotype (male)](/books/12-biology/Zoology/pic6.png )

### <u> Human Karyotype </u> 

Depending upon the position of the
centromere and relative length of two arms,
human chromosomes are of three types:
Metacentric, sub metacentric and acrocentric.
The photograph of chromosomes are arranged
in the order of descending length in groups
from A to G (Fig. 4.5).

### <u> 4.7 Pedigree Analysis </u> 

Pedigree is a “family tree”, drawn with
standard genetic symbols, showing the
inheritance pathway for specific phenotypic
characters.(Fig. 4.6). Pedigree analysis is the
study of traits as they have appeared in a given
family line for several past generations.

![Fig. 4.6 Symbols commonly used in pedigree charts](/books/12-biology/Zoology/pic7.png )


#### <u> Genetic Disorders </u> 

A genetic disorder is a disease or syndrome
that is caused by an abnormality in an individual
DNA. Abnormalities can range from a small
mutation in a single gene to the addition or
subtraction of an entire chromosome or even
a set of chromosomes. Genetic disorders are
of two types namely, Mendelian disorders and
chromosomal disorders.

### <u>4.8 Mendelian disorders </u> 

Alteration or mutation in a single gene
causes Mendelian disorders. These disorders
are transmitted to the offsprings on the same
line as the Mendelian pattern of inheritance.
Some examples for Mendelian disorders are
Thalassemia, albinism, phenylketonuria, sickle
cell anaemia, Huntington's chorea, etc., These
disorders may be dominant or recessive and
autosomal or sex linked.

#### <u>Thalassemia </u> 

Thalassemia is an autosomal recessive
disorder. It is caused by gene mutation resulting
in excessive destruction of RBC’s due to the
formation of abnormal haemoglobin molecules.
Normally haemoglobin is composed of four
polypeptide chains, two **alpha** and two **beta**
globin chains. Thalassemia patients have defects
in either the alpha or beta globin chain causing
the production of abnormal haemoglobin
molecules resulting in anaemia.

Thalassemia is classified into alpha and beta
based on which chain of haemoglobin molecule
is affected. It is controlled by two closely linked
genes HBA1 and HBA2 on chromosome 16.
Mutation or deletion of one or more of the four
alpha gene alleles causes **Alpha Thalassemia**.
In **Beta Thalassemia**, production of beta globin
chain is affected. It is controlled by a single
gene (HBB) on chromosome 11. It is the most
common type of Thalassemia and is also known
as Cooley’s anaemia. In this disorder the alpha
chain production is increased and damages the
membranes of RBC.

#### <u> Phenylketonuria </u> 

It is an inborn error of
**Phenylalanine** metabolism
caused due to a pair of
autosomal recessive genes.
It is caused due to mutation
in the gene PAH (phenylalanine hydroxylase
gene) located on chromosome 12 for the
hepatic enzyme “phenylalanine hydroxylase”
This enzyme is essential for the conversion of
phenylalanine to tyrosine. Affected individual
lacks this enzyme, so phenylalanine accumulates
and gets converted to phenylpyruvic acid and
other derivatives. It is characterized by severe
mental retardation, light pigmentation of skin
and hair. Phenylpyruvic acid is excreted in the
urine.

Phenylalanine -> phenylalanine  hydroxylase ->  Tyrosine

#### <u>Albinism </u> 

Albinism is an inborn error of metabolism,
caused due to an autosomal recessive gene.
Melanin pigment is responsible for skin colour.
Absence of melanin results in a condition called
albinism. A person with the recessive allele
lacks the tyrosinase enzyme system, which is
required for the conversion of dihydroxyphenyl
alanine (DOPA) into melanin pigment inside
the melanocytes. In an albino, melanocytes are
present in normal numbers in their skin, hair,
iris, etc., , but lack melanin pigment.

3, 4 dihydroxy  phenylalanine  (DOPA) -> Tyrosinase -> Melanin

#### <u> Huntington’s chorea </u> 

It is inherited as an autosomal dominant
lethal gene in man. It is characterized by
involuntary jerking of the body and progressive
degeneration of the nervous system,
accompanied by gradual mental and physical
deterioration. The patients with this disease
usually die between the age of 35 and 40.



### <u> 4.9 Chromosomal Abnormalities  </u>

Each human diploid (2n) body cell has
46 chromosomes (23 pairs). Chromosomal
disorders are caused by errors in the number
or structure of chromosomes. Chromosomal
anomalies usually occur when there is an
error in cell division. Failure of chromatids
to segregate during cell division resulting in
the gain or loss of one or more chromosomes
is called aneuploidy. It is caused by non-
disjunction of chromosomes. Group of
signs and symptoms that occur together and
characterize a particular abnormality is called
a syndrome. In humans, Down’s syndrome,
Turner’s syndrome, Klinefelter's syndrome,
Patau’s syndrome are some of the examples of
chromosomal disorders.

**a. Autosomal aneuploidy in human beings**

Several autosomal aneuploidies have been
reported in human beings. eg. Down’s syndrome
(21-Trisomy), Patau’s syndrome (13-Trisomy).

**1. Down’s Syndrome/Trisomy – 21**

Trisomic condition of chromosome - 21
results in Down’s syndrome. It is characterized by
severe mental retardation, defective development
of the central nervous system, increased separation
between the eyes, flattened nose, ears are malformed,
mouth is constantly open and the tongue protrudes.

**2. Patau’s Syndrome/Trisomy-13**


Trisomic condition of chromosome 13
results in Patau’s syndrome. Meiotic non
disjunction is thought to be the cause for this
chromosomal abnormality. It is characterized
by multiple and severe body malformations as
well as profound mental deficiency. Small head
with small eyes, cleft palate, malformation of
the brain and internal organs are some of the
symptoms of this syndrome.

**b. Allosomal abnormalities in human beings**

Mitotic or meiotic non-disjunction of sex
chromosomes causes allosomal abnormalities.
Several sex chromosomal abnormalities have
been detected. Eg. Klinefelter’s syndrome and
Turner’s syndrome.

**1. Klinefelter’s Syndrome (XXY Males)**

This genetic disorder is due to the presence
of an additional copy of the X chromosome
resulting in a karyotype of 47,XXY. Persons
with this syndrome have 47 chromosomes
(44AA+XXY). They are usually sterile males,
tall, obese, with long limbs, high pitched voice,
under developed genitalia and have feeble breast
(gynaecomastia) development.

**2. Turner’s Syndrome (XO Females)**

This genetic disorder is due to the loss
of a X chromosome resulting in a karyotype
of 45,X. Persons with this syndrome have
45 chromosomes (44 autosomes and one X
chromosome) (44AA+XO) and are sterile
females. Low stature, webbed neck, under
developed breast, rudimentary gonads lack of
menstrual cycle during puberty, are the main
symptoms of this syndrome.

**Summary**

Summary
Genetics is a branch of biology that deals
with the study of heredity and variation. It
describes how characteristics and features
pass on from the parents to their offsprings in
successive generations. Variation is the degree by
which progeny differ from their parents. A set of
three or more alleles of the same gene occupying
the same locus in a given pair of homologous
chromosomes controlling a particular trait is
called Multiple allele. ABO blood grouping in
man is a good example for multiple allelism.
Apart from A and B antigens, the RBC’s of
humans contain a special type of antigen called
Rh antigen/Rh factors. Erythroblastosis foetalis,
also called haemolytic disease of the newborn,
in which the red blood cells of a foetus are
destroyed due to maternal immune reaction
resulting from a blood group incompatibility
between the foetus and the mother.

The mechanism of determination of male
and female individuals in a species is called sex
determination. The chromosomes are different
in two sexes and referred to as allosomes; the
remaining chromosomes are named autosomes.
The inheritance of a trait that is determined by
a gene located on one of the sex chromosomes
is called sex linked inheritance. Haemophilia,
colourblindness, muscular dystrophy are some
examples for X linked inheritance in human
beings.

Pedigree analysis is the study of traits as
they have appeared in a given family line for
several generations. The genetic disorders are
of two types- Mendelian and chromosomal.
Alternations or mutation in single gene causes
Mendelian disorders like, thalassemia, albinism,
phenylketonuria, and Huntington’s chorea.
Chromosomal abnormalities arise due to
chromosomal non-disjunction, translocation,
deletion, duplication and inversion. Downs
syndrome, Klinefelter’s syndrome, Turner’s
syndrome and Patau’s syndrome are some of the
chromosomal disorders. Downs syndrome is
due to trisomy of chromosome 21. Presence of
trisomic condition of chromosome 13 results in
Patau’s syndrome. In Turner’s syndrome the sex
chromosome is XO and in Klinefelter’s syndrome
the condition is XXY. An idiogram refers to a
diagrammatic representation of chromosomes.
