All modes of reproduction have some basic features such as synthesis of RNA and
proteins, replication of DNA, cell division and growth, formation of reproductive units and
their fertilization to form new individuals. Organisms exhibit two major modes of
reproduction namely asexual and sexual reproduction. Reproduction by a single parent
without the involvement of gamete formation is asexual reproduction and the offspring
produced are genetically identical. Asexual reproduction is usually by amitotic or mitotic
division of the somatic (body) cells, hence is also known as somatogenic or blastogenic
reproduction. When two parents participate in the reproductive process involving two
types of gametes (ova and sperm), it is called sexual reproduction.
