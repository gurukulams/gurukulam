Asexual reproduction is wide spread among different organisms. It is common in
members of Protista, Bacteria, Archaea and in multicellular organisms with relatively
simple organisation. The offsprings show “uniparental inheritance” without any genetic
variation. The different modes of asexual reproduction seen in animals are fission,
budding, fragmentation and regeneration. Fission is the division of the parent
body into two or more identical daughterindividuals. Five types of fission are seen in
animals. They are binary fission, multiplefission, plasmotomy, strobilation and
sporulation.

In binary fission, the parent organism divides into two halves and
each half forms a daughter individual.The nucleus divides first amitotically or
mitotically (karyokinesis), followed by thedivision of the cytoplasm (cytokinesis).
The resultant offsprings are genetically identical to the parent. Depending on the
plane of fission, binary fission is of the
following types,

simple organisation. The offsprings show
“uniparental inheritance” without any genetic
variation. The different modes of asexual
reproduction seen in animals are fission,

Fission is the division of the parent
body into two or more identical daughter
individuals. Five types of fission are seen in
animals. **They are binary fission, multiple fission, plasmotomy, strobilation and sporulation.**


In **binary fission,** the parent
organism divides into two halves and
each half forms a daughter individual.
The nucleus divides first amitotically or
mitotically (karyokinesis), followed by the
division of the cytoplasm (cytokinesis).
The resultant offsprings are genetically
identical to the parent. Depending on the
plane of fission, binary fission is of the
following types,

i) Simple irregular binary fission

ii) Transverse binary fission

iii) Longitudinal binary fission

iv) Oblique binary fission

**Simple irregular binary fission** is seen in Amoeba like irregular shaped organisms
(Fig. 1.1), where the plane of division is hard to observe. The contractile vacuoles
cease to function and disappear. The nucleoli disintegrate and the nucleus divides
mitotically. The cell then constricts in the middle, so the cytoplasm divides and forms
two daughter cells. 

In **transverse binary fission,** the plane of the division runs along the transverse axis of the individual. e.g. Paramecium and Planaria.
In Paramecium **(Fig. 1.2)** the macronucleus divides by amitosis and the micronucleus
divides by mitosis. 

In **longitudinal binary fission,** the nucleus and the cytoplasm divides in the longitudinal axis of the organism **(Fig 1.3)**. In flagellates, the

flagellum is retained usually by one daughter cell. The basal granule is divided into two and the new basal granule forms a flagellum in the other daughter individual. e.g. *Vorticella and Euglena*. 

In **oblique binary fission** the plane of division is oblique. It is seen in dinoflagellates. *e.g. Ceratium.* 

In **multiple fission** the parent body divides into many similar daughter cells simultaneously. First, the nucleus divides repeatedly without the division of the cytoplasm, later the cytoplasm divides into as many parts as that of nuclei. Each cytoplasmic part encircles one daughter nucleus. This results in the formation of many smaller individuals from a single parent organism. If multiple fission produces four or many daughter individuals by equal cell division and the young ones do not separate until the process is complete, then this division is called **repeated fission**. *e.g. Vorticella.* 


During unfavorable conditions (increase or decrease in temperature, scarcity of food) Amoeba withdraws its pseudopodia and secretes a three-layered, protective, chitinous cyst wall around it and becomes inactive **(Fig. 1.4)**. This phenomenon is called **encystment**. When conditions become favourable, the encysted Amoeba divides
by multiple fission and produces many minute amoebae called **pseudopodiospore or amoebulae**. The cyst wall absorbs water and breaks off liberating the young
pseudopodiospores, each with a fine pseudopodia. They feed and grow rapidly to
lead an independent life. In some metazoan animals, a special type of transverse fission called **strobilation** occurs

**(Fig. 1.5)**. In the process of strobilation, several transverse fissions occur simultaneously giving rise to a number of individuals which often do not separate immediately from each other e.g. Aurelia. **Plasmotomy** is the division of multinucleated parent into many multinucleate daughter individuals with the division of nuclei. Nuclear division occurs later to maintain normal number of nuclei. Plasmotomy occurs in *Opalina and Pelomyxa(Giant Amoeba)*.

 During unfavourable conditions Amoeba multiplies by **sporulation** without encystment.

Nucleus breaks into several small fragments or chromatin blocks. Each fragment develops
a nuclear membrane, becomes surrounded by cytoplasm and develops a spore-case around
it (Fig. 1.6). When conditions become favourable, the parent body disintegrates and
the spores are liberated, each hatching into a young amoeba.


In **budding**, the parent body produces one or more buds and each bud grows into a young
one. The buds separate from the parent to lead a normal life. In sponges, the buds constrict and detach from the parent body and the bud develops into a new sponge (Fig. 1.7).

When buds are formed on the outer surface of the parent body, it is known as
**exogenous budding** e.g. Hydra. In Hydra when food is plenty, the ectoderm cells increase and
form a small elevation on the body surface **(Fig. 1.8)**. Ectoderm and endoderm are pushed
out to form the bud. The bud contains an interior lumen in continuation with parent’s
gastro-vascular cavity. The bud enlarges, develops a mouth and a circle of tentacles at its
free end. When fully grown, the bud constricts at the base and finally separates from the parent body and leads an independent life. 


**In Noctiluca**, hundreds of buds are
formed inside the cytoplasm and many remain within the body of the parent. This is called
**endogenous budding**. In freshwater sponges and in some marine sponges a regular and
peculiar mode of asexual reproduction occurs by internal buds called **gemmules** is seen
(Fig. 1.9). A completely grown gemmule is a hard ball, consisting of an internal mass of
food-laden archaeocytes. During unfavourable conditions, the sponge disintegrates but the
gemmule can withstand adverse conditions. When conditions become favourable, the
**gemmules** begin to hatch.

In **fragmentation**, the parent body
breaks into fragments (pieces) and each of the
fragment has the potential to develop into a new
individual. Fragmentation or pedal laceration
occurs in many genera of sea anemones. Lobes
are constricted off from the pedal disc and each
of the lobe grows mesenteries and tentacles to
form a new sea anemone.

In the tapeworm, Taenia solium the gravid
(ripe) proglottids are the oldest at the posterior
end of the strobila (Fig. 1.10). The gravid
proglottids are regularly cut off either singly or
in groups from the posterior end by a process
called apolysis. This is very significant since it
helps in transferring the developed embryos
from the primary host (man) to find a secondary
host (pig).

Regeneration is regrowth in the injured
region. Regeneration was first studied in Hydra
by Abraham Trembley in 1740. Regeneration is
of two types, **morphallaxis and epimorphosis**.
In morphallaxis the whole body grows from a
small fragment e.g. Hydra and Planaria. When
Hydra is accidentally cut into several pieces,
each piece can regenerate the lost parts and
develop into a whole new individual **(Fig. 1.11)**.
The parts usually retain their original polarity,
with oral ends, by developing tentacles
and aboral ends, by producing basal discs.
**Epimorphosis (Fig. 1.12)** is the replacement
of lost body parts. It is of two types, namely
**reparative and restorative** regeneration. In
reparative regeneration, only certain damaged
tissue can be regenerated, e.g. human beings
whereas in restorative regeneration severed
body parts can develop. e.g. star fish, tail of wall
lizard.
