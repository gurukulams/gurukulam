Fertilization occurs when a haploid sperm
fuses with a haploid ovum to form a fertilized
egg or diploid zygote.

The sperms deposited in the female
reproductive tract undergo capacitation, which
is a biochemical event that enables the sperm
to penetrate and fertilise the egg. Fertilization
occurs only if the ovum and sperms are
transported simultaneously to the ampullary
isthmic junction of the fallopian tube.
Before a sperm can enter the egg,
it must penetrate the multiple layers of
granulosa (follicular) cells which are around
the ovum forming the corona radiata
(Fig. 2.10). The follicular cells are held together
by an adhesive cementing substance called
hyaluronic acid. The acrosomal membrane
disintegrates releasing the proteolytic enzyme,
hyaluronidase during sperm entry through
the corona radiata and zona pellucida. This is
called acrosomal reaction. Once Fertilization
is accomplished, cortical granules from the
cytoplasm of the ovum form a barrier called
the Fertilization membrane around the ovum
preventing further penetration of other sperms.
Thus polyspermy is prevented.
The first cleavage produces two identical
cells called blastomeres. These produce 4 cells,
then 8 and so on. After 72 hours of Fertilization,
a loose collection of cells forms a berry shaped
cluster of 16 or more cells called the morula
(Fig. 2.11).
Under the influence of progesterone,
smooth muscles of the fallopian tube relax
and the dividing embryo takes 4-5 days to
move through the fallopian tube into the
uterine cavity and finally gets implanted in
the uterine wall. At this point the embryo
consists of a fluid filled hollow ball of about
100 cells, called the blastocyst. The blastocyst
is composed of a single layer of large flattened
cells called trophoblast and a small cluster
of 20-30 rounded cells called the inner cell
mass. The inner cell mass of the blastocyst
develops into the embryo and becomes
embedded in the endometrium of the uterus.

This process is called implantation and it
results in pregnancy.
If the fertilized ovum is implanted outside
the uterus it results in ectopic pregnancy.
About 95 percent of ectopic pregnancies
occur in the fallopian tube. The growth of
the embryo may cause internal bleeding,
infection and in some cases even death due to
rupture of the fallopian tube.

**Twins are two offsprings produced in the same pregnancy.**

➢ Monozygotic (Identical) twins are
produced when a single fertilized
egg splits into two during the first
cleavage. They are of the same sex,
look alike and share the same genes.

➢ Dizygotic (Fraternal) twins are
produced when two separate eggs
are fertilized by two separate sperms.
The twins may be of the same sex or
different sex and are non-identical.

➢ Siamese (United) twins are the
conjoined twins who are joined
during birth.
