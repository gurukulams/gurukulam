Every organ system in the human
body works continuously to maintain
homeostasis for the survival of the individual.
The human reproductive system is essential for
the survival of the species. An individual may
live a long healthy life without producing an
offspring, but reproduction is inevitable for the
existence of a species.
The reproductive system has four
main functions namely,

• to produce the gametes namely
sperms and ova

• to transport and sustain these gametes

• to nurture the developing offspring

• to produce hormones

The major reproductive events in human
beings are as follows:

• **Gametogenesis:** Formation of gametes by
spermatogenesis and oogenesis.

• **Insemination:** Transfer of sperms by the
male into the female genital tract.

• **Fertilization:** Fusion of male and
female gametes to form zygote, called
Fertilization.

• **Cleavage:** Rapid mitotic divisions of
the zygote which convert the single celled  zygote into a multicellular structure
called blastocyst.

• **Implantation:** Attachment of blastocyst
to the uterine wall.

• **Placentation:** Formation of placenta
which is the intimate connection between
foetus and uterine wall of the mother for
exchange of nutrients.

• **Gastrulation:** Process by which
blastocyst is changed into a gastrula with
three primary germ layers.

• **Organogenesis:** Formation of specific
tissues, organs and organ systems from
three germ layers.

• **Parturition:** Expulsion of the foetus from
the mother’s womb.

These functions are carried out by the
primary and accessory reproductive organs.
The primary reproductive organs namely
the ovary and testis are responsible for
producing the ova and sperms respectively.
Hormones secreted by the pituitary gland and
the gonads help in the development of the
secondary sexual characteristics, maturation
of the reproductive system and regulation
of normal functioning of the reproductive
system. The accessory organs help in
transport and to sustain the gametes and to
nurture the developing offspring.
