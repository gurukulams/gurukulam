The male reproductive system comprises
of a pair of testes, accessory ducts, glands and
external genitalia (Fig. 2.1).
Testes are the primary male sex organs.
They are a pair of ovoid bodies lying in the
scrotum (Fig.2.2 a). The scrotum is a sac of
skin that hangs outside the abdominal cavity.
Since viable sperms cannot be produced
at normal body temperature, the scrotum
is placed outside the abdominal cavity to
provide a temperature 2-3<sup>o</sup>C lower than the
normal internal body temperature. Thus,
the scrotum acts as a thermoregulator for
spermatogenesis.
Each testis is covered by an outermost
fibrous tunica albuginea and is divided
by septa into about 200 - 250 lobules each
containing 2-4 highly coiled testicular
tubules or seminiferous tubules. These highly
convoluted tubules which form 80 percent of
the testicular substance are the sites for sperm
production.
The stratified epithelium of the seminiferous
tubule is made of two types of cells namely sertoli
cells or nurse cells and spermatogonic cells
or male germ cells. Sertoli cells are elongated
and pyramidal and provide nourishment to
the sperms till maturation. They also secrete
inhibin, a hormone which
is involved in the negative
feedback control of sperm
production. Spermatogonic
cells divide meiotically and
differentiate to produce
spermatozoa.
Interstitial cells or
Leydig cells are embedded
in the soft connective
tissue surrounding the
seminiferous tubules.
These cells are endocrine in nature and secret

The failure of one or both testes to descend down into the scrotal sacs is
known as cryptorchism (crypto – hidden + orchis – testicle). It occurs in 1 – 3 percent of new born males. A surgical correction at a young age can rectify the defect, else these individuals may become sterile and are unable to produce viable sperms.

androgens namely the testosterone hormone
which initiates the process of spermatogenesis.
These cells are endocrine in nature and
are characteristic features of the testes of
mammals. Other immunologically competent
cells are also present.
The accessory ducts associated
with the male reproductive system
include rete testis, vasa efferentia,
epididymis and vas deferens
(Fig. 2.2 b). The seminiferous
tubules of each lobule converge to
form a tubulus rectus that conveys
the sperms into the rete testis. The
rete testis is a tubular network on
the posterior side of the testis. The
sperms leave the rete testis and enter
the epididymis through the vasa
efferentia. The epididymis is a single
highly coiled tube that temporarily
stores the spermatozoa and they
undergo physiological maturation
and acquire increased motility and
fertilizing capacity. The epididymis
leads to the vas deferens and joins
the duct of the seminal vesicle to
form the ejaculatory duct which
passes through the prostate and
opens into the urethra. The urethra
is the terminal portion of the male
reproductive system and is used to
convey both urine and semen at
different times. It originates from the
urinary bladder and extends through
the penis by an external opening
called urethral meatus.
The accessory glands of the
male reproductive system include the paired seminal vesicles and bulbourethral
glands also called Cowper’s gland and a single
prostate gland. The seminal vesicles secrete an
alkaline fluid called seminal plasma containing
fructose sugar, ascorbic acid, prostaglandins and

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf12.png )

a coagulating enzyme called vesiculase which
enhances sperm motility. The bulbourethral
glands are inferior to the prostate and their
secretions also help in the lubrication of the penis.
The prostate encircles the urethra and is just
below the urinary bladder and secretes a slightly
acidic fluid that contains citrate, several enzymes
and prostate specific antigens. Semen or seminal
fluid is a milky white fluid which contains
sperms and the seminal plasma (secreted from
the seminal vesicles, prostate gland and the
bulbourethal glands). The seminal fluid acts as a
transport medium, provides nutrients, contains
chemicals that protect and activate the sperms
and also facilitate their movement.
The penis is the male external genitalia
functioning as a copulatory organ. It is made
of a special tissue that helps in the erection of
penis to facilitate insemination. The enlarged
end of the penis called glans penis is covered
by a loose fold of skin called foreskin or
prepuce.
The female reproductive system is far more
complex than the male because in addition
to gamete formation, it has to nurture the
developing foetus. The female reproductive
system consists of a pair of ovaries along with
a pair of oviducts, uterus, cervix, vagina and

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf13.png )

the external genitalia located in the pelvic
region (Fig. 2.3 a). These parts along with the
mammary glands are integrated structurally and
functionally to support the process of ovulation,
Fertilization, pregnancy, child birth and child
care.
Ovaries are the primary female sex organs
that produce the female gamete, ovum. The
ovaries are located one on each side of the lower
abdomen. The ovary is an elliptical structure
about 2-4 cm long. Each ovary is covered by a
thin cuboidal epithelium called the germinal
epithelium which encloses the ovarian stroma.
The stroma is differentiated as the outer cortex and
inner medulla. Below the germinal epithelium is
a dense connective tissue, the tunica albuginea.
The cortex appears dense and granular due
to the presence of ovarian follicles in various
stages of development. The medulla is a
loose connective tissue with abundant blood
vessels, lymphatic vessels and nerve fibres.
The ovary remains attached to the pelvic
wall and the uterus by an ovarian ligament
called mesovarium.
The fallopian tubes (uterine tubes or
oviducts), uterus and vagina constitute the
female accessory organs (Fig. 2.3 b). Each
fallopian tube extends from the periphery
of each ovary to the uterus. The
proximal part of the fallopian
tube bears a funnel shaped
infundibulum. The edges of the
infundibulum have many finger
like projections called fimbriae

which help in collection of the ovum after
ovulation. The infundibulum leads to a wider
central portion called ampulla. The last part
of the oviduct is the isthmus which is short
and thick walled connecting the ampulla and
infundibulum to the uterus.
The uterus or womb is a hollow, thick-walled,
muscular, highly vascular and inverted pear
shaped structure lying in the pelvic cavity
between the urinary bladder and rectum. The
major portion of the uterus is the body and the
rounded region superior to it, is the fundus. The
uterus opens into the vagina through a narrow
cervix. The cavity of the cervix called the
cervical canal communicates with the vagina
through the external orifice and with the uterus
through the internal orifice. The cervical canal
along with vagina forms the birth canal.
The wall of the uterus has three layers of
tissues. The outermost thin membranous
serous layer called the perimetrium,
the middle thick muscular layer called
myometrium and the inner glandular layer
called endometrium. The endometrium
undergoes cyclic changes during the
menstrual cycle while myometrium exhibits
strong contractions during parturition.
Vagina is a large fibromuscular tube that
extends from the cervix to the exterior. It is
the female organ of copulation. The female
reproductive structures that lie external to
the vagina are called as the external genitalia or vulva comprising
of labia majora, labia
minora, hymen and
clitoris.
The Bartholin’s glands
(also called greater
vestibular glands) are
located posterior to
the left and right of the
opening of the vagina.
They secrete mucus to
lubricate the vagina and
are homologous to the bulbourethral glands
of the male. The Skene’s glands are located
on the anterior wall of the vagina and around
the lower end of the urethra. They secrete a
lubricating fluid and are homologous to the
prostate gland of the males.
The external opening of the vagina is partially
closed by a thin ring of tissue called the hymen.
The hymen is often torn during the first coitus
(physical union). However in some women it
remains intact. It can be stretched or torn due to
a sudden fall or jolt and also during strenuous
physical activities such as cycling, horseback
riding, etc., and therefore cannot be considered
as an indicator of a woman’s virginity.
The mammary glands are modified sweat
glands present in both sexes. It is rudimentary
in the males and functional in the females. A
pair of mammary glands is located in the
thoracic region. It contains glandular tissue
and variable quantities of fat with a median
nipple surrounded by a pigmented area called
the areola. Several sebaceous glands called
the areolar glands are found on the surface
and they reduce cracking of the skin of the
nipple. Internally each mammary gland
consists of 2-25 lobes, separated by fat and
connective tissues (Fig. 2.4). Each lobe is made
up of lobules which contain acini or alveoli
lined by epithelial cells. Cells of the alveoli
secrete milk. The alveoli open into mammary
tubules. The tubules of each lobe join to form

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf15.png )

a mammary duct. Several mammary ducts
join to form a wider mammary ampulla
which is connected to the lactiferous duct in
the nipple. Under the nipple, each lactiferous
duct expands to form the lactiferous sinus
which serves as a reservoir of milk. Each
lactiferous duct opens separately by a minute
pore on the surface of the nipple.
Normal development of the breast
begins at puberty and
progresses with changes
during each menstrual
cycle. In non-pregnant
women, the glandular
structure is largely
underdeveloped and
the breast size is largely
due to amount of fat
deposits. The size of
the breast does not have
an influence on the
efficiency of lactation.
