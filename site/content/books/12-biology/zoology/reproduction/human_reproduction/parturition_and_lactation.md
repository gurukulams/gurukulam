Parturition is the completion of pregnancy
and giving birth to the baby. The series of
events that expels the infant from the uterus
is collectively called “labour”. Throughout
pregnancy the uterus undergoes periodic
episodes of weak and strong contractions.
These contractions called Braxter-Hick’s
contractions lead to false labour. As the
pregnancy progresses, increase in the oestrogen
concentration promotes uterine contractions.
These uterine contractions facilitate moulding
of the foetus and downward movement of
the foetus. The descent of the foetus causes
dilation of cervix of the uterus and vaginal
canal resulting in a neurohumoral reflex called
Foetal ejection reflex or Ferguson reflex. This
initiates the secretion of oxytocin from the
neurohypophysis which in turn brings about
the powerful contraction of the uterine muscles
and leads to the expulsion of the baby through
the birth canal. This sequence of events is called
as parturition or childbirth.
Relaxin is a hormone secreted by the
placenta and also found in the corpus luteum.
It promotes parturition by relaxing the pelvic
joints and by dilatation of the cervix with
continued powerful contractions. The amnion
ruptures and the amniotic fluid flows out
through the vagina, followed by the foetus. The
placenta along with the remains of the umbilical
cord called “after birth” is expelled out after
delivery.
Lactation is the production of milk by
mammary glands. The mammary glands show
changes during every menstrual cycle, during
pregnancy and lactation. Increased level of
oestrogens, progesterone and human Placental
Lactogen (hPL) towards the end of pregnancy
stimulate the hypothalamus towards prolactin
– releasing factors. The anterior pituitary
responds by secreting prolactin which plays a
major role in lactogenesis.

Oxytocin causes the “Let-Down” reflex-
the actual ejection of milk from the alveoli

of the mammary glands. During lactation,
oxytocin also stimulates the recently emptied
uterus to contract, helping it to return to
pre - pregnancy size.

**Colostrum**

Colostrum, a nutrient rich
fluid produced by the human female
immediately after giving birth, is loaded
with immune, growth and tissue repair
factors. It acts as a natural antimicrobial
agent to actively stimulate the maturation
of the infant’s immune system. No artificial
feed can substitute the first milk, with all
its natural benefits and therefore should be
definitely fed to the baby after birth.

The mammary glands secrete a yellowish
fluid called colostrum during the initial
few days after parturition. It has less lactose
than milk and almost no fat, but it contains
more proteins, vitamin A and minerals.

**CAESAREAN** 

When normal vaginal delivery is not possible due to factors like position of
the baby and nature of the placenta, the baby is delivered through a surgical incision in the
woman’s abdomen and uterus. It is also termed as abdominal delivery or Caesarean Section or
‘C’ Section.

Colostrum is also rich in IgA antibodies. This
helps to protect the infant’s digestive tract
against bacterial infection. Breast milk is the
ideal food for infants as it contains all the
constituents in suitable concentration and is
easily digestible. It is fully sufficient till about
6 months of age and all infants must be breast
fed by the mother to ensure the growth of a
healthy baby.
