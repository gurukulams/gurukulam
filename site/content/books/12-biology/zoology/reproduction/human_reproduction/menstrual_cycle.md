The menstrual or ovarian cycle occurs
approximately once in every 28/29 days
during the reproductive life of the female from
menarche (puberty) to menopause except
during pregnancy. The cycle of events starting
from one menstrual period till the next one is
called the menstrual cycle during which cyclic
changes occurs in the endometrium every
month. Cyclic menstruation is an indicator of
normal reproductive phase (Fig. 2.9).

**Menstrual cycle comprises of the following phases**

1. Menstrual phase
2. Follicular or proliferative phase
3. Ovulatory phase
4. Luteal or secretory phase

**1. Menstrual phase**

The cycle starts with the menstrual phase
when menstrual flow occurs and lasts for 3-5
days. Menstrual flow is due to the breakdown of
endometrial lining of the uterus, and its blood
vessels due to decline in the level of progesterone
and oestrogen. Menstruation occurs only if the
released ovum is not fertilized. Absence of
menstruation may be an indicator of pregnancy.
However it could also be due to stress, hormonal
disorder and anaemia.

**2. Follicular or proliferative phase**

The follicular phase extends from the 5th
day of the cycle until the time of ovulation.
During this phase, the primary follicle in the
ovary grows to become a fully mature Graafian
follicle and simultaneously, the endometrium
regenerates through proliferation. These changes
in the ovary and the uterus are induced by the
secretion of gonadotropins like FSH and LH,
which increase gradually during the follicular
phase. It stimulates follicular development and
secretion of oestrogen by the follicle cells.

**3. Ovulatory phase**

Both LH and FSH attain peak level in
the middle of the cycle (about the 14th day).
Maximum secretion of LH during the mid
cycle called LH surge induces the rupture of
the Graafian follicle and the release of the ovum
(secondary oocyte) from the ovary wall into
the peritoneal cavity. This process is called
as ovulation.

**4. Luteal or secretory phase**

During luteal phase, the remaining part
of the Graafian follicle is transformed into
a transitory endocrine gland called corpus
luteum. The corpus luteum secretes large
amount of progesterone which is essential
for the maintenance of the endometrium.
If Fertilization takes place, it paves way for

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf22.png )

the implantation of the fertilized ovum. The
uterine wall secretes nutritious fluid in the
uterus for the foetus. So, this phase is also
called as secretory phase. During pregnancy
all events of menstrual cycle stop and there is
no menstruation.

In the absence of Fertilization, the corpus
luteum degenerates completely and leaves a scar
tissue called corpus albicans. It also initiates
the disintegration of the endometrium leading
to menstruation, marking the next cycle.

**POLY CYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME (PCOS)**

PCOS is a complex endocrine system disorder that affects women in their reproductive
years. Polycystic means ‘many cysts’. It refers to many partially formed follicles on the ovaries,
which contain an egg each. But they do not grow to maturity or produce eggs that can be
fertilized. Women with PCOS may experience irregular menstrual cycles, increased androgen
levels, excessive facial or body hair growth (hirsutism), acne, obesity, reduced fertility and
increased risk of diabetes. Treatment for PCOS includes a healthy lifestyle, weight loss and
targeted hormone therapy.

**Menstrual hygiene**

Menstrual hygiene is vital for good
health, well-being, dignity, empowerment
and productivity of women. The impact of
poor menstrual hygiene on girls is increased
stress levels, fear and embarrassment during
menstruation. This can keep girls inactive
during such periods leading to absenteeism
from school.
Clean and safe absorbable clothing
materials, sanitary napkins, pads, tampons
and menstrual cups have been identified
as materials used to manage menstruation.
Changing sanitary material 4-5 hours as per
the requirement, provides comfort, cleanliness
and protection from infections. It also helps in
enhancing the quality of life of women during
this period. Used sanitary napkins should be
wrapped in paper and disposed. It should not
be thrown in open areas or drain pipe of toilets.
Flushing of sanitary napkins in the drain pipes
causes choking of the drainage line leading to
water pollution.

**Disposal of Napkins**

The ecofriendly way to dispose
menstrual waste scientifically and
hygienically is to destroy the sanitary napkins
using incinerators. Measures are being taken
to install incinerators and napkin vending
machines in washrooms of schools , colleges
and public facilities.

**Menopause**

Menopause is the phase in a women’s
life when ovulation and menstruation stops.
The average age of menopause is 45-50 years.
It indicates the permanent cessation of the
primary functions of the ovaries.
