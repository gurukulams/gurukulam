Gametogenesis is the process of formation
of gametes i.e., sperms and ovary from the
primary sex organs in all sexually reproducing
organisms. Meiosis plays the most significant
role in the process of gametogenesis **(Fig.2.5).**

**Spermatogenesis**

Spermatogenesis is the sequence of
events in the seminiferous tubules of the
testes that produce the male gametes, the
sperms. During development, the primordial
germ cells migrate into the testes and become
immature germ cells called sperm mother
cells or spermatogonia in the inner surfaces
of the seminiferous tubules **(Fig. 2.6 a)**. The
spermatogonia begin to undergo mitotic
division at puberty and continue throughout
life.

In the first stage of spermatogenesis, the
spermatogonia migrate among sertoli cells
towards the central lumen of the seminiferous
tubule and become modified and enlarged
to form primary spermatocytes which are
diploid with 23 pairs i.e., 46 chromosomes.

Some of the primary spermatocytes
undergo first meiotic division to form two
secondary spermatocytes which are haploid
with 23 chromosomes each. The secondary
spermatocytes undergo second meiotic
division to produce four haploid spermatids.
The spermatids are transformed into mature
**spermatozoa (sperms)** by the process
called **spermiogenesis.** Sperms are finally
released into the cavity of seminiferous
tubules by a process called **spermiation.**
The whole process of spermatogenesis
takes about 64 days. At any given time,
different regions of the seminiferous tubules
contain spermatocytes in different stages
of development **(Fig. 2.6 b).** The sperm
production remains nearly constant at a rate
of about 200 million sperms per day.


Spermatogenesis starts at the age of
puberty and is initiated due to the increase
in the release of **Gonadotropin Releasing**
**Hormone (GnRH)** by the hypothalamus.
GnRH acts on the anterior pituitary gland and
stimulates the secretion of two gonadotropins
namely **Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Lutenizing Hormone (LH)**. FSH
stimulates testicular growth and enhances the
production of **Androgen Binding Protein (ABP)** by the sertoli cells and helps in the
process of spermiogenesis. LH acts on the
Leydig cells and stimulates the synthesis of
**testosterone** which in turn stimulates the
process of spermatogenesis.

**Structure of human spermatozoan**

The human sperm is a microscopic,
flagellated and motile gamete **(Fig. 2.7).**
The whole body of the sperm is enveloped
by plasma membrane and is composed of a
head, neck and a tail. The head comprises
of two parts namely acrosome and nucleus.
**Acrosome** is a small cap like pointed
structure present at the tip of the nucleus
and is formed mainly from the Golgi body
of the spermatid. It contains **hyaluronidase**,
a proteolytic enzyme, popularly known as
sperm lysin which helps to penetrate the
ovum during Fertilization. The nucleus is flat
and oval. The neck is very short and is present
between the head and the middle piece.
It contains the proximal centriole towards
the nucleus which plays a role in the first
division of the zygote and the distal centriole
gives rise to the axial filament of the sperm.
The middle piece possesses mitochondria
spirally twisted around the axial filament
called **mitochondrial spiral or nebenkern**.
It produces energy in the form of ATP
molecules for the movement of sperms. The tail is the longest part
of the sperm and is
slender and tapering.
It is formed of a
central axial filament
or **axoneme** and an
outer protoplasmic
sheath. The lashing
movements of the
tail push the sperm
forward. The human
male ejaculates about
200 to 300 million
sperms during coitus.
It is estimated that
around 60 percent
of sperms must have
normal shape of which
at least 40 per cent
must show vigorous
motility for normal fertility.

The sperm is the smallest
human cell and the
ovum or egg is the largest
human cell.

**Oogenesis**

Oogenesis is the process of development
of the female gamete or ovum or egg in the
ovaries. During foetal development, certain
cells in the germinal epithelium of the foetal
ovary divide by mitosis and produce millions of
**egg mother cells or oogonia.** No more oogonia
are formed or added after birth. The oogonial
cells start dividing and enter into Prophase I of
meiotic division I to form the **primary oocytes**
which are temporarily arrested at this stage.
The primary oocytes then get surrounded by
a single layer of granulosa cells to form the
primordial or **primary follicles** (Fig. 2.8 a).
A large number of follicles degenerate during the
period from birth to puberty, so at puberty only
60,000 to 80,000 follicles are left in each ovary.

{{< box title=" DID YOU KNOW" type="objective">}}
Out of the million eggs
women possess during
birth, only about 300 to
400 will ovulate before
menopause.

On the other hand, males produce more
than 500 billion sperms in their life time.
The primary follicle gets surrounded
by many layers of granulosa cells and a new
theca layer to form the **secondary follicle.** A
fluid filled space, the antrum develops in the
follicle and gets transformed into a **tertiary follicle**. The theca layer gets organized into an
inner theca interna and an outer theca externa.
At this time, the primary oocyte within the
tertiary follicle grows in size and completes its
first meiotic division and forms the secondary
oocyte. It is an unequal division resulting in
the formation of a large haploid secondary
oocyte and a first polar body. The first polar
body disintegrates. During Fertilization, the
secondary oocyte undergoes second meiotic
division and produces a large cell, the ovum
and a second polar body. The second polar body
also degenerates. The tertiary follicle eventually
becomes a mature follicle or Graafian follicle.
If Fertilization does not take place, second
meiotic division is never completed and the
egg disintegrates. At the end of gametogenesis
in females, each primary oocyte gives rise to
only one haploid ovum.

**Structure of ovum**

Human ovum is non-cleidoic, alecithal
and microscopic in nature. (Fig. 2.8 (b)). Its
cytoplasm called ooplasm contains a large
nucleus called the germinal vesicle. The ovum
is surrounded by three coverings namely an
inner thin transparent vitelline membrane,
middle thick zona pellucida and outer thick
coat of follicular cells called corona radiata.
Between the vitelline membrane and zona
pellucida is a narrow perivitelline space.
