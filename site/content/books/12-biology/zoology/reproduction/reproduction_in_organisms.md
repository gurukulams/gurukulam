Living organisms show a life cycleinvolving birth, growth, development,
maturation, reproduction and death. Reproduction is the fundamental feature of
all living organisms. It is a biological process by which organisms produce their young
ones. The young ones grow and mature to repeat the process. Thus reproduction results in continuation of species and introduces variations in organisms, which are essential
for adaptation and evolution of their own kind.

**1.1. Modes of reproduction**

All modes of reproduction have some basic features such as synthesis of RNA and
proteins, replication of DNA, cell division and growth, formation of reproductive units and
their fertilization to form new individuals. Organisms exhibit two major modes of
reproduction namely asexual and sexual reproduction. Reproduction by a single parent
without the involvement of gamete formation is **asexual reproduction** and the offspring
produced are genetically identical. Asexual reproduction is usually by amitotic or mitotic
division of the somatic (body) cells, hence is also known as somatogenic or blastogenic
reproduction. When two parents participate in the reproductive process involving two
types of gametes (ova and sperm), it is called **sexual reproduction.**

**1.2. Asexual reproduction**

Asexual reproduction is wide spread among different organisms. It is common in
members of Protista, Bacteria, Archaea and in multicellular organisms with relatively
simple organisation. The offsprings show “uniparental inheritance” without any genetic
variation. The different modes of asexual reproduction seen in animals are fission,
budding, fragmentation and regeneration. 

**Fission** is the division of the parent
body into two or more identical daughterindividuals. Five types of fission are seen in
animals. They are binary **fission, multiplefission, plasmotomy, strobilation and sporulation.**

In **binary fission,** the parent organism divides into two halves and
each half forms a daughter individual.The nucleus divides first amitotically or
mitotically (karyokinesis), followed by thedivision of the cytoplasm (cytokinesis).
The resultant offsprings are genetically identical to the parent. Depending on the
plane of fission, binary fission is of the
following types,

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf1.png )


i) Simple irregular binary fission

ii) Transverse binary fission

iii) Longitudinal binary fission

iv) Oblique binary fission

**Simple irregular binary fission** is seen in *Amoeba* like irregular shaped organisms
**(Fig. 1.1)**, where the plane of division is hard to observe. The contractile vacuoles
cease to function and disappear. The nucleoli disintegrate and the nucleus divides
mitotically. The cell then constricts in the middle, so the cytoplasm divides and forms
two daughter cells. 

In **transverse binary fission**, the plane of the division runs along the transverse axis of the individual. e.g. *Paramecium and Planaria*.


In Paramecium **(Fig. 1.2)** the macronucleus divides by amitosis and the micronucleus
divides by mitosis.

 In **longitudinal binary fission**, the nucleus and the cytoplasm divides in the longitudinal axis of the organism (Fig 1.3). In flagellates, the


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf1.png )

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf2.png )


flagellum is retained usually by one daughter cell. The basal granule is divided into two and the new basal granule forms a flagellum in the other daughter individual. e.g. *Vorticella and Euglena.* 

In **oblique binary fission** the plane of division is oblique. It is seen in dinoflagellates. *e.g. Ceratium.* 


In **multiple fission** the parent body divides into many similar daughter cells simultaneously. First, the nucleus divides repeatedly without the division of the cytoplasm, later the cytoplasm divides into as many parts as that of nuclei. Each cytoplasmic part encircles one daughter nucleus. This results in the formation of many smaller individuals from a single parent organism. If multiple fission produces four or many daughter individuals by equal cell division and the young ones do not separate until the process is complete, then this division is called **repeated fission.**  *e.g. Vorticella.* 


During unfavorable conditions (increase or decrease in temperature, scarcity of food) Amoeba withdraws its pseudopodia and secretes a three-layered, protective, chitinous cyst wall around it and becomes inactive **(Fig. 1.4)**. This phenomenon is called **encystment**. When conditions become favourable, the encysted Amoeba divides
by multiple fission and produces many minute amoebae called **pseudopodiospore**
or **amoebulae.** The cyst wall absorbs water and breaks off liberating the young
pseudopodiospores, each with a fine pseudopodia. They feed and grow rapidly to
lead an independent life. 

In some metazoan animals, a special type of transverse fission called **strobilation occurs**

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf3.png )

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf4.png )

**(Fig. 1.5).** In the process of strobilation, several transverse fissions occur simultaneously giving rise to a number of individuals which often do not separate immediately from each other e.g. Aurelia. **Plasmotomy** is the division of multinucleated parent into many multinucleate daughter individuals with the division of nuclei. Nuclear division occurs later to maintain normal number of nuclei. Plasmotomy occurs in *Opalina and Pelomyxa*(Giant Amoeba). 

During unfavourable conditions Amoeba multiplies by sporulation without encystment.


Nucleus breaks into several small fragments or chromatin blocks. Each fragment develops
a nuclear membrane, becomes surrounded by cytoplasm and develops a spore-case around
it **(Fig. 1.6)**. When conditions become favourable, the parent body disintegrates and
the spores are liberated, each hatching into a young amoeba.


In **budding,** the parent body produces one or more buds and each bud grows into a young
one. The buds separate from the parent to lead a normal life. In sponges, the buds constrict and detach from the parent body and the bud develops into a new sponge **(Fig. 1.7).**


![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf5.png )

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf6.png )

When buds are formed on the outer surface of the parent body, it is known as
**exogenous budding** e.g. Hydra. In Hydra when food is plenty, the ectoderm cells increase and
form a small elevation on the body surface **(Fig. 1.8)**. Ectoderm and endoderm are pushed
out to form the bud. The bud contains an interior lumen in continuation with parent’s
gastro-vascular cavity. The bud enlarges, develops a mouth and a circle of tentacles at its
free end. When fully grown, the bud constricts at the base and finally separates from the parent body and leads an independent life. 

In **Noctiluca**, hundreds of buds are
formed inside the cytoplasm and many remain within the body of the parent. This is called
**endogenous budding**. In freshwater sponges and in some marine sponges a regular and
peculiar mode of asexual reproduction occurs by internal buds called gemmules is seen
(Fig. 1.9). A completely grown **gemmule** is a hard ball, consisting of an internal mass of
food-laden archaeocytes. During unfavourable conditions, the sponge disintegrates but the
gemmule can withstand adverse conditions. When conditions become favourable, the
gemmules begin to hatch.

![lesson 1](/books/12-biology/zoology/unit1/bzf7.png )

In **fragmentation**, the parent body
breaks into fragments (pieces) and each of the
fragment has the potential to develop into a new
individual. Fragmentation or pedal laceration
occurs in many genera of sea anemones. Lobes
are constricted off from the pedal disc and each
of the lobe grows mesenteries and tentacles to
form a new sea anemone.

In the tapeworm, Taenia solium the gravid
(ripe) proglottids are the oldest at the posterior
end of the strobila **(Fig. 1.10)**. The gravid
proglottids are regularly cut off either singly or
in groups from the posterior end by a process
called apolysis. This is very significant since it
helps in transferring the developed embryos
from the primary host (man) to find a secondary
host (pig).

Regeneration is regrowth in the injured
region. Regeneration was first studied in Hydra
by Abraham Trembley in 1740. Regeneration is
of two types, **morphallaxis and epimorphosis**.
In morphallaxis the whole body grows from a
small fragment e.g. Hydra and Planaria. When
Hydra is accidentally cut into several pieces,
each piece can regenerate the lost parts and
develop into a whole new individual **(Fig. 1.11)**.
The parts usually retain their original polarity,
with oral ends, by developing tentacles
and aboral ends, by producing basal discs.
**Epimorphosis** (Fig. 1.12) is the replacement
of lost body parts. It is of two types, namely
**reparative and restorative** regeneration. In
reparative regeneration, only certain damaged
tissue can be regenerated, e.g. human beings
whereas in restorative regeneration severed
body parts can develop. e.g. star fish, tail of wall
lizard.

**1.3. Sexual reproduction**

Sexual reproduction involves the fusion
of male and female gametes to form a diploid zygote, which develops into
a new organism. It leads to genetic variation. The types
of sexual reproduction seen in animals are syngamy
(fertilization) and conjugation. In **syngamy**, the fusion of two
haploid gametes takes place to produce a diploid
zygote. Depending upon the place where the
fertilization takes place, it is of two types. In
**external fertilization**, the fusion of male and
female gametes takes place outside the body
of female organisms in the water medium.
e.g. sponges, fishes and amphibians. In **internal fertilization**, the fusion of male and female
gametes takes place within the body of female
organisms. e.g. reptiles, aves and mammals.

{{< box title="POWER OF REGENERATION" type="objective">}}

Sponge when macerated
and squeezed through
fine silk cloth, the cluster of cells pass
through, and these can regenerate new
sponges. This technique is used for
cultivation of sponges.


{{< /box >}}



Different kinds of syngamy (fertilization)
are prevalent among living organisms.

a) **Autogamy**- The male and female
gametes are produced by the same cell or same
organism and both the gametes fuse together
to form a zygote. e.g. Actinosphaerium and
Paramecium.

b) **Exogamy**- The male and female gametes
are produced by different parents and they fuse
to form a zygote. So it is biparental. e.g. Human
– dioecious or unisexual animal.

c) **Hologamy**- Lower organisms,
sometimes the entire mature organisms do not
form gametes but they themselves behave as
gametes and the fusion of such mature individuals
is known as hologamy e.g. Trichonympha.

d) **Paedogamy**- It is the sexual union of
young individuals produced immediately after
the division of the adult parent cell by mitosis.

e) **Merogamy**- The fusion of small
sized and morphologically different gametes
(merogametes) takes place.

f) **Isogamy**- The fusion of morphological
and physiological identical gametes
(isogametes) is called isogamy. e.g. Monocystis.

g) **Anisogamy**- The fusion of dissimilar
gametes is called anisogamy (Gr. An-without;
iso-equal; gam-marriage). Anisogamy occurs
in higher animals but it is customary to use
the term fertilization instead of anisogamy
or syngamy. e.g. higher invertebrates and all
vertebrates.

Conjugation is the temporary union of the
two individuals of the same species. During their
union both individuals, called the conjugants
exchange certain amount of nuclear material
(DNA) and then get separated. Conjugation
is common among ciliates, e.g. Paramecium,
Vorticella and bacteria (Prokaryotes).

**Phases of life cycle:**

 Organisms have three phases – Juvenile phase, reproductive phase and
senescent phase. **Juvenile phase/ vegetative phase** is the period of growth between the birth
of the individual upto reproductive maturity.
During **reproductive phase/ maturity phase**
the organisms reproduce and their offsprings
reach maturity period. On the basis of time,
breeding animals are of two types: **seasonal breeders and continuous breeders.** Seasonal
breeders reproduce at particular period of
the year such as frogs, lizards, most birds,
deers etc., Continuous breeders continue to
breed throughout their sexual maturity e.g.
honey bees, poultry, rabbit etc., **Senescent phase** begins at the end of reproductive phase
when degeneration sets in the structure and
functioning of the body.



**PARTHENOGENESIS**

**(Gr. Parthenos – virgin, Genesis-produce)**

Development of an egg into a complete
individual without fertilization is known as
parthenogenesis. It was first discovered by
Charles Bonnet in 1745. Parthenogenesis is of
two main types namely, Natural Parthenogenesis
and Artificial Parthenogenesis. In certain
animals, parthenogenesis occurs regularly,
constantly and naturally in their life cycle and
is known as **natural parthenogenesis.**

{{< box title=" Natural parthenogenesis are of different types:" type="objective">}}

a) **Arrhenotoky**: In this type
only males are produced by parthenogenesis.
e.g. honey bees

b) **Thelytoky**: In this type only females are
produced by parthenogenesis. e.g. Solenobia

c) **Amphitoky**: In this type parthenogenetic
egg may develop into individuals of any sex.
e.g. Aphis

Natural parthenogenesis may be of
two types, viz., complete and incomplete.
**Complete parthenogenesis** is the only form
of reproduction in certain animals and there is
no biparental sexual reproduction. There are
no male organisms and so, such individuals
are represented by females only. **Incomplete parthenogenesis** is found in some animals
in which both sexual reproduction and
parthenogenesis occurs. e.g. In honeybees;
fertilized eggs (zygotes) develop into queen
and workers, whereas unfertilized eggs
develop into drones (male). **In paedogenetic parthenogenesis (paedogenesis)** the larvae
produce a new generation of larvae by
parthenogenesis. It occurs in the sporocysts
and Redia larvae of liver fluke. It is also seen
in the larvae of some insects. e.g. Gall fly. In
**artificial parthenogenesis**, the unfertilized
egg (ovum) is induced to develop into a
complete individual by physical or chemical
stimuli. e.g., Annelid and seaurchin eggs.
