##  Learning Objectives

To gain knowledge / insight about:

➢ The local and geographical distribution
- abundance of organisms.

➢ Temporal changes in the occurrence,
abundance and activities.

➢ Interrelationship between
organism in population
and communities.

➢ Structural adaptation and
functional adjustment
of organisms to their physical
environment.

➢ The evolutionary development of all
these interrelations.

➢ Population growth, models, regulation.

➢ Animal associations – intraspecific,
interspecific.


The word ‘ecology’ is derived from the
Greek term ‘oikos’, meaning ‘house’ and
logos, meaning ‘study’. Thus, the study of the
environmental ‘house’ includes all the organisms
in it and all the functional processes that make
the house habitable.

The study of ecology encompasses
different levels-organism, population,
community, ecosystem, etc., In ecology, the
term population, originally coined to denote
a group of people is broadened to include
groups of individuals of any one kind of
organism. Community in the ecological sense
(designated as ‘biotic community’) includes
all the populations occupying a given area.
The community (Biotic) and the non-living
environment (Abiotic) function together as
an ecological system (or) ecosystem. Biome
is a term in wide use for a large regional or
sub continental system characterized by a
major vegetation type. The largest and most
nearly self-sufficient biological system is often
designated as the Ecosphere, which includes all
the living organisms of the Earth, interacting
with the physical environment to regulate
their distribution, abundance, production and
evolution.

**10.1 Organism and its environment**

Every living organism has its own
specific surrounding, medium or environment
with which it continuously interacts and
develops suitable adaptations for survival
there. Environment is a collective term which
includes the different conditions in which an
organism lives or is present. The common and
influencing factors in any environment are light,
temperature, pressure, water, salinity. These are
collectively referred to as Abiotic components.
Environments are variable and dynamic, in
which temperature changes and light changes
are diurnal and seasonal. These influence the
organisms inhabiting them. An organism’s
growth, distribution, number, behavior and
reproduction is determined by the different
factors present in the environment.

**10.2 Habitat**

Habitat refers to the place where an
organism or a community of organisms live,
including all biotic and abiotic factors or
conditions of the surrounding environment.
The collection of all the habitat areas of a species
constitutes its geographical range. Organisms
in a habitat interact with each other and can be
part of trophic levels to form food chains and
food webs.
Examples: In a xerophytic habitat, the
camel is able to use water efficiently and
effectively for evaporative cooling through their
skin and respiratory system. They excrete highly
concentrated urine and can also withstand
dehydration upto 25% of the body weight. The
hoofs and hump are also suitable adaptations
for survival in this dry sandy environment.
In an aquatic media, maintaining
homeostasis and osmotic balance is a
challenge. So, marine animals have appropriate
adaptations to prevent cell shrinkage. While
freshwater organisms have suitable adaptations
to withstand bursting of their cells. Apart
from this, organisms such as fish have a wide range of adaptations like fins (locomotion),
streamlined body (aerodynamic), lateral line
system (sensory), gills (respiration), air sacs
(floatation) and kidneys (excretion).

**Niche (or) Ecological Niche**

As every organism has its unique habitat,
so also it has an ecological niche which includes
the physical space occupied by an organism
and its functional role in the community.
The ecological niche of an organism not only
depends on where it lives but also includes the
sum total of its environmental requirements.
Charles Elton (1927) was the first to use
the term ‘niche’ as the functional status of an
organism in its community. Groups of species
with comparable role and niche dimensions
within a community are termed ‘guilds’.
Species that occupy the same niche in different
geographical regions, are termed ‘ecological
equivalents’.
Many animals share the same general
habitat. But their niches are well defined. The life
style of an individual population in the habitat
is known as its niche. For example, crickets
and grasshoppers are closely related insects
that live in the same habitat, yet they occupy
different ecological niches. The grasshopper is
very active during daylight. It can usually be
found on a plant, feeding on the plant parts.
Although the cricket lives in the same field, it
is quite different. During the day, the cricket
hides under leaves or plant debris and is usually
inactive. It is active at night time (nocturnal).
The cricket and the grasshopper do not interfere
with each other’s activities in the same habitat.
Thus, niche of an organism can be defined as
the total position and function of an individual
in its environment.
In a pond ecosystem, where Catla, Rohu
and Mrigal are present, the ecological niche of
the Catla is a surface feeder, Rohu is a column
feeder and Mrigal is a bottom feeder. Their
mouths are designed to suit their niche and
hence have different positions and functions in
their habitat (Fig.10.1).

**10.3 Major Abiotic Components or Factors**

The abiotic factors include the chemical
and physical factors which influence or affect
organisms and their functioning in their
environment. The common abiotic factors are:

**Temperature**

Temperature or degree of hotness and
coldness is an essential and variable factor in
any environment. It influences all forms of life
by affecting many vital activities of organisms
like metabolism, behaviour, reproduction,
development and even death in the Biosphere.
The minimum and maximum temperature of an
environment regulates the survival of a cell.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/zoology/Tweety.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
lesson 1
{{< /figure >}}


The metabolism of organisms is regulated
by enzymes which are temperature sensitive. In
many organisms, determination of sex and sex
ratio, maturation of gonads, gametogenesis and
reproduction is influenced by temperature. In
certain environments, the size and colouration
of animals are influenced by temperature. Birds
and mammals attain greater body size in colder
regions than warmer regions (Bergmann’s
rule). Warm blooded animals, living in colder
climates, tend to have shorter limbs, ears and
other appendages when compared to the
members of the same species in warmer climates
(Allen’s rule). In some aquatic environments, an
inverse relationship between water temperature
and fish meristic characters is observed -
lower the temperature, more the vertebrae
(Jordon’s rule).


{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/zoology/Tweety.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
lesson 1
{{< /figure >}}


Temperature influences the distribution
of organisms. The tropics have higher diversity
and density of populations, when compared to
temperate and polar regions.

**Adaptations to temperature**

Adaptation to temperature is essential
for the survival of the species/organisms.
Organisms which can survive a wide range of
temperature are referred to as Eurytherms (cat, dog, tiger, human). Eurythermy can be
an evolutionary advantage: adaptations to cold
temperatures (cold-eurythemy) are seen as
essential for the survival of species during ice
ages. In addition, the ability to survive in a
wide range of temperatures increases a species'
ability to inhabit other areas, an advantage
for natural selection. Eurythermy is an aspect of
thermoregulation in organisms.
Those organisms which can tolerate only a
narrow range of temperature are Stenotherms
(Fish, Frogs, Lizards and Snakes).
Over the course of time, by evolution,
animals of different ecological habitats have
developed different variations and adaptations
to temperature changes. It enabled them to
survive in different habitats and develop niches.
In case of extreme temperatures, organisms have
adapted by forming heat resistant spores, cysts
(Entamoeba), antifreeze proteins (Arctic fishes).
Hibernation (winter sleep) and Aestivation
(Summer sleep) are useful adaptations to
overcome extreme winters and summers. In
certain conditions, migration is an appropriate
adaptation to overcome extreme temperatures
and resultant water and food scarcity. (Fig 10.2).

**Light**

It is an important and essential abiotic
factor. Ecologically, the quality (wavelength or
colour), the intensity (actual energy in gram calories) and duration (length of day) of light are considered significant for organisms.
Light influences growth, pigmentation,
migration and reproduction. The
intensity and frequency of light influences
metabolic activity, induce gene mutations
(UV, X- rays). Light is essential for vision. This
is proved by the poorly developed or absence
of eyes in cave dwelling organisms. Diapause is
also influenced by light in animals. Gonads of
birds become more active with increasing light
in summer. Light influences the locomotion
and movement of lower animals.

**WATER**

Life on earth began in the seas and water
is essential for the survival of all forms of life.
About three-fourth of the earth’s surface is
covered with water (hydrosphere). Water is
found in three states: gaseous, liquid, and solid.
There are two types of water on Earth.
They are the Fresh water (rivers, lakes, ponds)
and the Salt water (seas and oceans). Based on
the dissolved salts, water can be hard water
(sulphates/nitrates of Calcium/Magnesium)
or soft water. If hardness can be removed by
boiling, it is temporary hard water, and if boiling
does not help, it is permanent hard water.
Essential properties of water

• Water is one of the main agents in
Pedogenesis (soil formation).

• It is the medium for several different
ecosystems.

• It is present as moisture in the atmosphere
and the outer layers of the lithosphere and is
uneven in distribution on the earth.

• Water is heavier than air and imparts greater
buoyancy to the aquatic medium. This
enables organism to float at variable levels.

• Water has high heat capacity and latent heat,
due to which it can withhold large amounts
of heat. Thus, oceans and lakes tend to
maintain a relatively constant temperature,
and the biosphere is relatively thermostable.

• Water is physically unique because it is less
dense as a solid (ice) than as a liquid.

• When water freezes (0<sup>0</sup>C), it contracts. The
maximum density of liquid water occurs at
4<sup>0</sup>C. Below that, it expands markedly. This
enables ice to float on the top of water bodies.
Hence, only the surface of water bodies will
freeze, while below the surface, water will be
in liquid form, sustaining life (Fig. 10.3).

• Water is considered as the Universal solvent.
It is the main medium by which chemical
constituents are transported from abiotic
components to the living components of an ecosystem.

• Water has high surface tension. This allows
pollen, dust, and even water striders to
remain at the surface of a water body even
though they are denser than the water.

**Soil**

It is a mixture of organic matter, minerals,
gases, liquids and organisms that together
support life. The soil zone is known as
Pedosphere. Soil is formed from rocks which
are the parent materials of soil, by weathering
and is called embryonic soil (Pedogenesis).
It has four major functions-

• medium for plant growth

• means for water storage and purification

• modifier of earth’s atmosphere

• habitat for many organisms, which in turn
modify the soil
Soil is formed of many horizontal layers called
as Soil Profile.

**Properties of Soil**

1. Texture of soil – The texture of soil is
determined by the size of the soil particles.
The types of soil include sand, silt and clay
on the basis of their size differences.

2. Porosity – The space present between soil
particles in a given volume of soil are called
pore spaces. The percentage of soil volume
occupied by pore space or by the interstitial
spaces is called porosity of the soil.

3. Permeability of soil-The characteristic
of soil that determines the movement of
water through pore spaces is known as soil
permeability. Soil permeability is directly
dependent on the pore size. Water holding
capacity of the soil is inversely dependent
on soil porosity.

4. Soil Temperature-Soil gets its heat energy from solar radiation, decomposing organic
matter, and heat from the interior of earth.
Soil temperature effects the germination
of seeds, growth of roots and biological activity of soil-inhabiting micro-and macro-
organisms.

5. Soil water- In soil, water is not only important
as a solvent and transporting agent, but also
maintains soil texture, arrangement and
compactness of soil particles, making soil
habitable for plants and animals.

**Wind**

Wind is the natural movement of air of any
velocity from a particular direction. The two
main causes are differential heating between the
equator and the poles and the rotation of the
planet (Coriolis effect). Wind helps to transport
pollen grains, seeds, and even flight of birds.
While it is the source of wind energy, it also
causes erosion. Wind speed is measured with
an Anemometer.

**Humidity**

Moisture in the form of invisible vapor
in the atmosphere is called humidity. which
is generally expressed in terms of absolute
humidity, relative humidity or specific humidity.
Absolute humidity is the total mass of water
vapour present in a given volume or mass of air.
It does not take temperature into consideration.
Relative humidity is the amount of water
vapour present in air and is expressed as a
percentage of the amount needed for saturation
at the same temperature Relative humidity is
expressed as a percentage; a high percentage
means that the air-water mixture is more
humid at a given temperature. Humidity is
measured with a Hygrometer.

**Altitude**

This factor is mainly the elevation or gradient
and it affects temperature and precipitation in
an ecosystem or biome. As altitude increases,
temperature and density of oxygen decreases.
Higher altitudes usually receive snow instead of
rain because of low temperature.
Animals are known to modify their
response to environmental changes (stress) in
reasonably short time spans. This is known as
Acclimatization. This is observed when people
who have moved from the plains to higher
altitudes show enhanced RBC count within a
few days of settling in their new habitat. This
helps them cope with lower atmospheric oxygen
and higher oxygen demand.

**10.4 Concept of biome and their distribution**

Biomes are large regions of earth that
have similar or common vegetation and
climatic conditions. They play a crucial role
in sustaining life on Earth. They are defined
by their soil, climate, flora and fauna. Biomes
have distinct biological communities that
have been formed in response to a shared
physio-chemical climate. Biomes are seen to
even spread across continents. Thus, it can be
observed that a biome is a broader term than
habitat. Any biome can comprise a variety of
habitats. Factors such as temperature, light,
water availability determine what type of
organisms and adaptations are observed in a
biome (Fig. 10.4).

**Characters of a biome**

• Location, Geographical position (Latitude,
Longitude)

• Climate and physiochemical environment

• Predominant plant and animal life

• Boundaries between biomes are not always
sharply defined. Transition or transient
zones are seen as in case of grassland and
forest biomes (Fig. 10.5).

**Aquatic Biomes**

They occupy about 71% of the biosphere.
The aquatic biome is home to millions of aquatic
organisms like fishes. The climate of coastal
zones are influenced by aquatic bodies.

**Aquatic biomes of earth**

1. Freshwater (Lakes, ponds, rivers)

2. Brackish water (Estuaries / Wetlands)

3. Marine (Coral reefs, pelagic zones and
abyssal zones)

**Terrestrial biomes**

These are large communities of plants and
animals that occupy a distinct region. They
include grassland, tundra, desert, tropical rainforest, and deciduous and coniferous
forests. Terrestrial biomes are distinguished
primarily by their predominant vegetation,
and are mainly determined by climate, which
in turn, determines the organisms inhabiting
them. These include the keystone species and
indicator species which are unique to their
respective biomes. The terrestrial biomes are a
source of food, O2 and act as CO2 sink, apart
from the climate regulatory role.
Major Biomes of the Earth
Tundra biome, Taiga biome, Grassland
biome, Alpine biome, Forest biome and Desert
biome.

**TUNDRA BIOME**

• This is the almost treeless plain in the
northern parts of Asia, Europe and North
America.

• Winters are long with little daylight,
Summers are short, with long daylight
hours.

• Precipitation is less than 250 mm per year.
It is a zone of permafrost.

• Dwarf willows, birches, mosses, grasses,
sedges are the flora here.

• Reindeer, arctic hare, musk ox, lemmings
are important Tundra herbivores. Some
important carnivores are the arctic fox,
arctic wolf, bobcat and snowy owl. Polar
bears live along coastal areas.

• Because of the severe winters, many of the
animals are migratory. For example, the
many shore birds and waterfowl such as
ducks and geese, nest in the Tundra during
the summer and migrate south for the winter.

**TAIGA BIOME**

• The Taiga is 1300-1450 km wide zone south
of the Tundra.

• This area has long and cold winters.

• Summer temperature ranges from 100 C to 210 C.

• Precipitation ranges about 380-1000 mm
annually.

• The Taiga is a forest of coniferous trees such
as spruce, fir and pine. This is a major source
for the logging industry.

• Important migratory herbivores include
moose, elk, deer and reindeer. Moose and
reindeer migrate to the Taiga for winter and to
the Tundra for summers. The common smaller
mammals are herbivorous squirrels, snowshoe
hare and predatory pine martens. Important
predators include the timber wolf, grizzly bear,
black bear, bobcat and wolverines. (Fig. 10.6)

{{< /figure >}}

**GRASSLAND BIOME**

• Grasslands occur in temperate and in the
tropical regions.

• They have hot summers, cold winters, and
irregular rainfall.

• Often they are characterized by high winds.

• The low irregular rainfall is the factor which
makes the difference between a temperate
deciduous forest and a temperate grassland.

• Herbivores like antelope, bison, wild horse,
jack rabbit, ground squirrel and prairie dogs
are abundant.

• Predators include coyotes, foxes, hawks and
snakes.

• In India, fauna of grasslands includes
Elephant, Gaur, Rhino, Antelope.

• Flora of grasslands include purple needle
grass, wild oats, foxtail, ryegrass and buffalo
grass (Fig. 10.7).

{{< /figure >}}


**Alpine biome**

• The alpine zone (zone between timber line
and snow zone) includes in the descending
order, a sub-snow zone immediately below
the snow zone, a meadow zone in the centre
and a shrub zone which gradually merges
into the timber zone.

• The snow zone of Himalayas lies over
5100m above mean sea level and alpine
zone exists at a height of 3600m. From an
ecological view point, the zone above the
limits of tree growth (timber line) exhibits
extreme environmental conditions which
greatly influence the biota of this region.



{{< box title=" DID YOU KNOW" type="objective">}}

Historically biomes are
known to move as climate
changes. A classic example
is the Sahara Desert, which
years ago was supposed to
be a lush landscape with river flowing
through it. Accordingly, appropriate
fauna like Hippos, Giraffes, Crocodiles
lived amid abundant trees. Over course
of time the climate dried out. It has now
become the planets largest desert. The
animals have migrated out to adjacent
regions with more favourable conditions.
(Source: National Geography)
{{< /box >}}

• Alpine zone of Himalayas is characterized
by sparseness of animal groups. Many
invertebrates of alpine zone are predatory
and occur in lakes, streams and ponds.
Among fishes, amphibians and vertebrates
are totally lacking and reptilian fauna is
greatly impoverished.

• Flora of alpines includes alpine phacelia,
bear grass, bristlecone pine, moss campion,
polylepis forest, pygmy bitterroot, and
wild potato.

**Forest biomes**

Forest is a broad term used to describe
areas where there are a large number of
trees (Fig. 10.8). The forest biomes include a
complex assemblage of different kinds of biotic
communities. The major forest biomes are the
Tropical forests and the Temperate forests.
Tropical forest

• They occur near the equator (between
latitudes 23.50 at north and 23.50 at south).

• The major characteristic of tropical forests is
their distinct seasons. Only two seasons are
present (rainy and dry). Winter is absent.

The length of daylight is about 12 hours and
varies little.

• The average annual temperature ranges
between 20° C and 25°C.

• Precipitation is evenly distributed
throughout the year with annual rainfall
exceeding 2000 mm.

• Soil is nutrient-poor and acidic.
Decomposition is rapid and soils are subject
to heavy leaching.

• Tree canopy is multilayered and continuous,
allowing little light penetration.

• Flora is highly diverse: one square kilometer
may contain as many as 100 different tree
species. Trees are 25-35 m tall, with buttressed
trunks and shallow roots, mostly evergreen,
with large dark green leaves. Common
vegetation are orchids, bromeliads, vines
(lianas), ferns, mosses, and palms.

• They are characterized by the greatest
diversity of fauna which includes birds, bats,
small mammals, and insects.

{{< box title="" type="">}}
More than half of earth’s tropical forests
have already been destroyed.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/zoology/Tweety.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
lesson 1
{{< /figure >}}


**Temperate forest**

• These forests occur in eastern North
America, northeastern Asia and western
and central Europe.

• Have well-defined seasons with a distinct
winter. Moderate climate and a growing season of 140-200 days during 4-6 frost-
free months distinguish temperate forests.

• Annual temperature varies from -30° C to
30°C.

• Precipitation (750-1500 mm) is distributed
evenly throughout the year.

• Soil is fertile, enriched with decaying litter.

• Canopy is moderately dense and
allows light to penetrate, resulting in
well-developed and richly diversified
understorey vegetation and stratification
of animals.

• Flora is characterized by 3-4 tree species
per km<sup>2</sup>. Trees have broad leaves that are
lost annually such as oak, hickory, beech,
hemlock, maple, basswood, cottonwood,
elm, willow, and spring-flowering herbs.

• Fauna consists of squirrels, rabbits, skunks,
birds, deer, mountain lion, bobcat, timber
wolf, fox, and black bear.


{{< box title="" type="">}}
Only scattered remnants of original
temperate forests remain today.
{{< /box >}}

**Desert biomes**

• Deserts cover about one fifth of the earth's
surface and occur where rainfall is >500mm/year.

• Rainfall is usually very low and/or
concentrated in short bursts between
long rainless periods. Evaporation rates
regularly exceed rainfall rates.

• Soils are course-textured, shallow, rocky
or gravely with good drainage and have no
subsurface water. The finer dust and sand
particles are blown elsewhere, leaving
heavier pieces behind. Sand dunes are
common.

• Mean annual temperatures range from
20-25°C. The extreme maximum ranges
from 43.5 - 49° C. Minimum temperatures
sometimes drop to -18°C. Based on the
temperature range, deserts can be Hot
deserts and Cold deserts.

• Hot deserts such as the Sahara of North
Africa and the deserts of the southwestern
U.S., Mexico, Australia and India
(Thar desert) occur at low latitudes.

• Hot deserts have a considerable amount
of specialized vegetation (xerophytes),
aloe, agave, Opuntia species, Euphorbia
royleana as well as specialized vertebrate
and invertebrate animals.

• The dominant animals of warm deserts are
reptiles and small mammals. The Indian
Spiny-tailed lizard, the blackbuck, the
white-footed fox are the common fauna
of the Thar deserts. There are also insects,
arachnids and birds.

• Cold deserts occur in Antarctic, Greenland
and the Nearctic realm, parts of USA and in
parts of western Asia and the Ladakh region
in India.

• Widely distributed animals are jack rabbits,
kangaroo rats, kangaroo mice, pocket
mice, grasshopper mice, antelope and
ground squirrels.

{{< box title=" DID YOU KNOW" type="objective">}}
Rainfall is lowest in
the Atacama Desert of
Chile, where it averages
less than 15 mm. Some
years are even rainless.
Inland Sahara also receives less than
15 mm rainfall a year. Rainfall in
American deserts is higher — almost
280 mm a year.

**10.5 Responses To Abiotic Factors**

Every living organism responds to
its environment. There are various ways
by which organisms respond to abiotic
conditions. Some organisms can maintain
constant physiological and morphological
conditions or undertake steps to overcome
the environmental condition, which in itself
is a response (Fig. 10.9).


{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/zoology/Tweety.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
lesson 1
{{< /figure >}}


**The types of responses observed are**

**• Regulate:**

Some organisms are able to
maintain homeostasis by physiological
means which ensures constant body
temperature, ionic / osmotic balance.
Birds, mammals and a few lower vertebrate
and invertebrate species are capable of such
regulation.

**• Conform:** 

Most animals cannot maintain
a constant internal environment. Their
body temperature changes with the
ambient temperature. In aquatic animals
like fishes, the osmotic concentration of
the body fluids changes with that of the
ambient water osmotic concentration. Such
animals are called Conformers. In case of
extreme condition, the inhabitants relocate
themselves as in migration.

**• Migrate:** 

Organisms tend to move away
temporarily from a stressful habitat to a
new, hospitable area and return when the
stressful period is over. Birds migrate from
Siberia to Vedanthangal in Tamilnadu to
escape from the severe winter periods.

**• Suspend:**

In certain conditions, if the
organisms is unable to migrate, it may avoid
the stress by becoming inactive. This is seen
commonly in bears going into hibernation
during winter. Some snails and fish go
into aestivation to avoid summer related problems like heat and desiccation. Some
lower animals suspend a certain phase of their
life cycle, which is referred to as diapause.

**10.6 Adaptations**

In biology, adaptation is a
dynamic evolutionary process
that fits organisms to their
environment and enhancing
their evolutionary fitness.
Adaptations can be a phenotypic or adaptive
trait with a functional role in each individual
organism that is maintained and has
been evolved by natural selection. The adaptive
traits may be structural adaptation, behavioural
adaptation and physiological adaptation.

**a) Structural adaptations**

The external and internal structures of
animals can help them to adapt better to their
environment. Some of the most common
examples are mammals growing thicker fur
to survive freezing climates. Some of the
most attractive adaptations in nature occur
for reasons of crypsis (e.g. camouflage) and
mimicry. Cryptic animals are those which
camouflage perfectly with their environment
and are almost impossible to detect. Certain
reptiles and insects such as chameleons and
stick insects show this type of adaptation,
which helps in prey capture or to evade from
predators. Likewise, horse legs are suitable
for fast running and adapted for grasslands
and similar terrestrial environments.

**b) Behavioural adaptations**

Action and behaviour of animals are
instinctive or learned. Animals develop certain
behavioural traits or adaptations for survival.
Fleeing from a predator, hiding during sleep,
seeking refuge from climate change or moving
to find different food sources are all behavioral
adaptations. The two most characteristic forms
of behavioral adaptations are migration and
courtship. Migration allows the animals to find better resources or evade threat. Courtship is a set of behavioral patterns to find a mate to
reproduce. Most nocturnal animals remain
underground or inactive during daytime. This
is a modification of their feeding and activity
pattern or habit or behaviour.


{{< box title="" type="">}}
Ethology is the scientific study of animal
behaviour, under natural conditions.
{{< /box >}}

**c) Physiological adaptations**

These are adaptations of organisms
that help them to live and survive in their
environment with unique niches. Example:
Lions have sharp canines to hunt and tear
meat and a digestive system suitable for
digesting raw meat. The two most well-known
physiological adaptations are hibernation and
aestivation. These are two different types of
inactivity where the metabolic rate slows down
so much that the animal can survive without
eating or drinking. Aquatic medium and
terrestrial habitats have their own respective
environmental conditions. Hence organisms
have to evolve appropriate adaptations to select
suitable habitats and niches.

**Adaptations of aquatic animals**

1. The pectoral fins and dorsal fins act as
stabilizers or balancers and the caudal
fin helps in changing the direction as a
rudder.

2. Arrangement of body muscles in the
form of bundles (myotomes) help in
locomotion.

3. Stream lined structure helps in the swift
movement of the animals in water.

4. Respiration by gills making use of gases
dissolved in water.

5. Presence of air-bladders filled with air
for buoyancy.

6. Presence of lateral-line system. They
function as rheoreceptors which is
helpful in echolocating objects in water.

7. Integuments rich in mucous glands are
protected by scales.

8. Maintain water and ionic balance in its
body with excretory structures.

**Adaptations of terrestrial animals**

1. Earthworms, land Planarians secrete
a mucus coating to maintain a moist
situation for burrowing, coiling,
respiration, etc.,

2. Arthropods have an external covering
over the respiratory surfaces and well-
developed tracheal systems.

3. In vertebrate skin, there are many
cellular layers besides the well protected
respiratory surfaces that help in
preventing loss of water.

4. Some animals obtain their water
requirement from food as partial
replacement of water lost through
excretion.

5. Birds make nests and breed before the
rainy season as there is availability of
abundant food. But during drought
birds rarely reproduce.

6. Camels are able to regulate water
effectively for evaporative cooling
through the skin and respiratory system
and excrete highly concentrated urine,
and can also withstand dehydration up
to 25% of their body weight.

**10.7 Populations**

Population is defined
as any group of organisms
of the same species which
can interbreed among
themselves, and occupy a particular space
and function as part of a biotic community.
A population has various properties like
population density, natality (birth rate),
mortality (death rate), age distribution, biotic
potential, dispersion and ‘r’, ‘K’ selected growth forms. A population possesses genetic
characteristics that are directly related to
their adaptiveness, reproductive success, and
persistence in their habitats over time. Life
history of an organism is an important part
of this attribute. The population has a definite
structure and function that can be described
with reference to time.

**10.8 Population Attributes** 

**Population density**

The density of a population refers to
its size in relation to unit of space and time.
Population density is the total number of that
species within a natural habitat. The size of
the population can be measured in several
ways, including abundance (absolute number
in population), numerical density (number
of individuals per unit area (or) volume) and
biomass density (biomass per unit area (or)
volume). The population density of a species
can also be expressed with reference to the
actual area of habitat available to the species
When the size of individuals in the population
is relatively uniform then density is expressed
in terms of number of individuals (numerical
density).

**Natality**

Populations increase because of
natality. Natality is equivalent to birth rate
and is an expression of the production of new
individuals in the population by birth, hatching,
germination (or) fission. The two main aspects of
reproduction, namely fertility and fecundity play
a significant role in a population. Natality rate
may be expressed in crude birth rate number of
organisms born per female per unit time.


**eqn to be add**


**Mortality**

Mortality is the population decline factor and
is oppposite to natality. Mortality can be expressed
as a loss of individuals in unit time or death
rate. Generally, mortality is expressed as specific
mortality, that is, the number of members of an
original population dying after the lapse of a given
time. The crude death rate of a population can be
calculated by the equation.

**eqn to be add**

The rate of mortality (death) is determined
by density. Mortality is high at high density
because of the hazards of overcrowding,
increased predation and spread of disease.
Mortality rates vary among species and
are correlated and influenced by a number
of factors such as destruction of nests, eggs
or young by storms, wind, floods, predators,
accidents and desertion by parents.

**Population Dispersion**

Populations have a tendency to disperse
or spread out in all directions, until some
barriers are reached. This is observed by the
migration of individuals into (Immigration)
or out (Emigration) of the population area.

**Migration**

Migration is a peculiar and unique kind of
mass population movement from one place to
another and back. To avoid the severe winter
cold, Siberian cranes migrate from Siberia
to Vedanthangal in Tamil Nadu and return
back in spring. Some fishes are known to
migrate from sea to fresh water (anadromous
migration, Salmon) and some from fresh
water to sea (catadromous migration, Eel).

**Emigration**

Under natural conditions, emigration
usually occurs when there is overcrowding. This
is regarded as an adaptive behavior that regulates
the population in a particular site and prevents over exploitation of the habitat. Further, it leads to occupation of new areas elsewhere.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/zoology/Tweety.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
lesson 1
{{< /figure >}}


**Immigration**

It leads to a rise in population levels. If
the population increases beyond the carrying
capacity, it can result in increased mortality
among the immigrants or decreased
reproductive capacity of the individuals.
Both emigration and immigration are
initiated or triggered by weather and other
abiotic and biotic factors.

**10.9 Population Age Distribution:**

The proportion of the age groups
(pre-reproductive, reproductive and post
reproductive) in a population is its age distribution
attribute. This determines the reproductive status
of the population at the given time and is an
indicator of the future population size.
Usually a rapidly growing population will
have larger proportion of young individuals. A
stable population will have an even distribution
of various age classes. A declining population
tends to have a larger proportion of older
individuals (Fig. 10.10).

**10.10 Growth Models / Curves**

Populations show characteristic growth
patterns or forms. These patterns can be plotted
and termed as J-shaped growth form and
S-shaped growth form (Sigmoid form).

**J shaped growth form:**

When a population increases rapidly in an
exponential fashion and then stops abruptly due
to environmental resistance or due to sudden
appearance of a limiting factor, they are said
to exhibit J-shaped growth form. Many insects
show explosive increase in number during the
rainy season followed by their disappearance at
the end of the season (Fig. 10.11).


{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/zoology/Tweety.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
lesson 1
{{< /figure >}}

**S-Shaped growth form (sigmoid growth)**

Some populations, as in a population of
small mammals, increase slowly at first then
more rapidly and gradually slow down as
environmental resistance increases whereby equilibrium is reached and maintained. Their
growth is represented by S shaped growth
curve.


{{< box title="" type="">}}

**Biotic potential or Reproductive capacity (r)**

It is the maximum reproductive
capacity of an organism under optimum
environmental conditions.

**Carrying capacity (K)**

The maximum number of organism that
a region can support without environmental
degradation is called carrying capacity.

**Environmental resistance**

Is the sum total of the environmental
limiting factors, both biotic and abiotic,
which together act to prevent the biotic
potential of an organism from being realized.

**10.11 Population Regulation**

The inherent tendency of all animal
populations is to increase in number. But it does
not increase indefinitely. Once the carrying
capacity of the environment is reached,
population numbers remain static or fluctuate
depending on environmental conditions. This is
regulated by many factors which are

1. Density independent – Extrinsic factors

2. Density dependent - Intrinsic factors
Extrinsic factors include availability of space,
shelter, weather, food, etc. Intrinsic factors
include competition, predation, emigration,
immigration and diseases.

**10.12 Population Interaction**

Organisms belonging to different
populations interact for food, shelter, mating
or for other necessities. Interaction may be
intra specific (interaction within the members
of same species) or inter specific (among
organisms of different species).
Intra specific association is observed for all
livelihood processes like feeding, territoriality,
breeding and protection.
Interspecific associations or interactions
can be:

Neutral: where different species live together
but do not affect each other.

Positive: it is a symbiotic relationship in which
no organism in association is harmed and either
one or both may be benefitted. It is of two types
– Mutualism and Commensalism.

Negative: One or both of the interacting
organisms will be affected as in case of
competition, predation, parasitism.
The common types of interspecific
inter actions are:

**Summary**

Ecology is the study of the relationships
of living organisms with the abiotic and
biotic components of their environment.
Temperature, Light, Water, Soil, Humidity,
Wind and Topographic factors are the important
physical components of the environment to
which the organisms are adapted in various
ways. Maintenance of a constant internal
environment by the organisms contributes to
optimal performance, but only some organisms
(regulators) are capable of homeostasis in the
fact of changing external environment. Others
simply conform. Many species have evolved
adaptations to avoid unfavourable conditions in
space or in time.

Population ecology is an important area of
ecology. A population is a group of individuals
of a given special sharing or competing for
similar resources in a defined geographical
area. Populations have attributes that individual
organisms do not, such as natality and mortality, sex ratio and age distribution. The proportion of different age groups of males and females
in a population is often presented graphically
as age pyramid, its shape indicated whether a
population is stationary, growing or declining.
Ecological effects of any factors on a
population are generally reflected in population
density. Population grow through births and
immigration and decline through deaths and
emigration. When resources are unlimited,
the growth is usually exponential but when
resources become progressively limiting the
growth pattern turns logistic. In either case,
growth is ultimately limited by the carrying
capacity of the environment. The intrinsic rate
of natural increase is a measure of the inherent
potential of a population to grow.
Population of the same or different species
in a habitat do not live in isolation but interact
in many ways. These interactions may be intra
specific or interspecific. They may be positive,
negative or neutral in nature.
