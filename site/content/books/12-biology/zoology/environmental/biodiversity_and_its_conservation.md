A wide variety of living organisms including
plants, animals and micro-organisms with
whom we share this planet earth makes the world
a beautiful place to live in. Living organisms exist
almost everywhere from mountain peaks to the
ocean depths; from deserts to the rainforests.
They vary in their habit and behaviour, shape,
size and colour. The remarkable diversity of
living organisms forms an inseparable and
significant part of our planet, however, the ever
increasing human population is posing serious
threats to bio-diversity. In this chapter, we shall
discuss biodiversity – concepts, levels, magnitude
and patterns, importance of biodiversity,
biogeographical regions of India, threats to
biodiversity, causes of biodiversity loss, extinction,
and biodiversity conservation.

**11.1 Biodiversity**

The 1992 UN Earth Summit defined
Biodiversity as the variability among living
organisms from all sources, including
terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems
and the ecological complexes of which they are
a part. This includes diversity within species,
between species and ecosystems of a region.
It reflects the number of different organisms
and their relative frequencies in an ecological
system and constitutes the most important
functional component of a natural ecosystem.
It helps to maintain ecological processes,
create soil, recycle nutrients, influence climate,
degrade waste and control diseases. It provides
an index of health of an ecosystem. The survival
of human race depends on the existence and
wellbeing of all life forms (plants and animals)
in the biosphere.

**11.1.1 Concept of biodiversity**

The term biodiversity was introduced
by Walter Rosen (1986). Biodiversity is the
assemblage of different life forms. Each species
is adapted to live in its specific environments.
The changes in climatic conditions are
reflected in the distribution and pattern of
biodiversity on our planet. The number of
species per unit area declines as we move
from tropics towards the poles. The Tundra
and Taiga of northern Canada, Alaska,
northern Europe and Russia possess less than
12 species of trees. The temperate forests of
the United states have 20-35 species of trees,
while the tropical forests of Panama have over
110 species of trees in a relatively small area.

**11.1.2 Levels of biodiversity**

Edward Wilson popularized the term
‘Biodiversity’ to describe diversity at all levels
of biological organization from populations to
biomes. There are three levels of biodiversity
– Genetic diversity, Species diversity and
Community/Ecosystem diversity (Fig. 11.1).
Genetic diversity refers to the differences
in genetic make-up (number and types of genes)
between distinct species and to the genetic
variation within a single species; also covers
genetic variation between distinct populations
of the same species. Genetic diversity can
be measured using a variety of molecular
techniques. India has more than 50,000 genetic
variants of Paddy and 1000 variants of Mango.
Variation of genes of a species increases with
diversity in size and habitat. It results in the

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/zoology/unit5/bzf5.10.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
lesson 1
{{< /figure >}}


formation of different races, varieties and
subspecies. Rouwolfia vomitaria, a medicinal
plant growing in different ranges of the
Himalayas shows differences in the potency
and concentration of the active ingredient
reserpine due to genetic diversity. Genetic
diversity helps in developing adaptations to
changing environmental conditions.
Species diversity refers to the variety
in number and richness of the species in any
habitat. The number of species per unit area at
a specific time is called species richness, which
denotes the measure of species diversity. The
Western Ghats have greater amphibian species
diversity than the Eastern Ghats. The more
the number of species in an area the more is
the species richness (Fig. 11.1a). The three
indices of diversity are - Alpha, Beta and
Gamma diversity.

i. Alpha diversity: It is measured by counting
the number of taxa (usually species) within
a particular area, community or ecosystem.

ii. Beta diversity: It is species diversity
between two adjacent ecosystems and is
obtaining by comparing the number of
species unique to each of the ecosystem.

iii. Gamma diversity refers to the diversity
of the habitats over the total landscape or
geographical area.


{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/zoology/unit5/bzf5.11.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
lesson 1
{{< /figure >}}

Community/Ecosystem diversity is the
variety of habitats, biotic communities, and
ecological processes in the biosphere. It is the
diversity at ecosystem level due to diversity of
niches, trophic levels and ecological processes
like nutrient cycles, food webs, energy flow
and several biotic interactions. India with its
alpine meadows, rain forests, mangroves,
coral reefs, grass lands and deserts has one of
the greatest ecosystem diversity on earth.

**11.1.3 Magnitude of biodiversity**

Biodiversity is often quantified as the
number of species in a region at a given time.
The current estimate of different species on
earth is around 8-9 million. However, we really
don’t know the exact magnitude of our natural
wealth. This is called the ‘The Taxonomic
impediment’. So far about 1.5 million species of
microorganisms, animals and plants have been described. Each year about 10-15 thousand
new species are identified and published
worldwide, of which 75% are invertebrates. The
number of undescribed species is undoubtedly
much higher.
India is very rich in terms of biological
diversity due to its unique bio-geographical
location, diversified climatic conditions and
enormous eco-diversity and geo-diversity.
According to world biogeographic classification,
India represents two of the major realms
(The Palearctic and Indo-Malayan) and three
biomes (Tropical humid forests, Tropical Dry/
Deciduous forests and Warm Deserts/Semi
deserts). With only about 2.4% of the world’s
total land surface, India is known to have over
8 % of the species of animals that the world
holds and this percentage accounts for about
92,000 known species.
India is the seventh largest country in the
world in terms of area. India has a variety of
ecosystems, biomes with its varied habitats
like, hills, valleys, plateaus, sea shores,
mangroves, estuaries, glaciers, grasslands
and river basins. It also reflects different
kinds of climates, precipitation, temperature
distribution, river flow and soil. India is one
of the 17 mega biodiversity countries of the
world and has ten biogeographic zones with
characteristic habitat and biota.

"The world is currently undergoing a very
rapid loss of biodiversity comparable
with the great mass extinction events
that have previously occurred only
five or six times in the earth's history."
- **World Wildlife Fund*

**11.1.4 Patterns of biodiversity distribution**

The distribution of plants and animals
is not uniform around the world. Organisms
require different sets of conditions for their optimum metabolism and growth. Within
this optimal range (habitat) a large number
and type of organisms are likely to occur,
grow and multiply. The habitat conditions are
determined by their latitudes and altitudes.

**Latitudinal and altitudinal gradients:**

Temperature, precipitation, distance from the
equator (latitudinal gradient), altitude from sea
level (altitudinal gradient) are some of the factors
that determine biodiversity distribution patterns.
The most important pattern of biodiversity is
latitudinal gradient in diversity. This means
that there is an increasing diversity from the
poles to equator. Diversity increases as one
moves towards the temperate zones and reaches
the maximum at the tropics. Thus, tropics
harbour more biodiversity than temperate or
polar regions, especially between the latitudes
of 23.50N and 23.50S (Tropic of Cancer to the
Tropic of Capricorn). Harsh conditions exist in
temperate areas during the cold seasons while
very harsh conditions prevail for most of the year
in polar regions.
Columbia located near the equator (00) has
nearly 1400 species of birds while New York at
410N has 105 species and Greenland at 710N
has 56 species. India, with much of its land area
in the tropical latitudes, is home for more than
1200 species of birds. Thus it is evident that the
latitude increases the species diversity.
Decrease in species diversity occurs as
one ascends a high mountain due to drop in
temperature (temperature decreases @ 6.50C
per Km above mean sea level)
The reasons for the richness of
biodiversity in the Tropics are:

• Warm tropical regions between the tropic
of Cancer and Capricorn on either side
of equator possess congenial habitats for
living organisms.

• Environmental conditions of the tropics
are favourable not only for speciation

Mean Sea Level (MSL) is an average
level of the surface of one or more of
Earth’s oceans (or seas) from which
heights such as elevations may be
measured.

As we travel by train we notice names
of stations on big yellow signboards
on which is usually written how much
elevated that place is compared to MSL.
For example, Erode junction is about
171 meters above MSL.

but also for supporting both variety and
number of organisms.

• The temperatures vary between 250C to
350C, a range in which most metabolic
activities of living organisms occur with
ease and efficiency.

• The average rainfall is often more than
200 mm per year.

• Climate, seasons, temperature, humidity,
photoperiods are more or less stable and
encourage both variety and numbers.

• Rich resource and nutrient availability.
Species - Area relationships
German Naturalist and Geographer
Alexander von Humboldt explored the
wilderness of south American jungles and
found that within a region the species richness
increased with increasing area but upto a certain limit. The relationship between species
richness and area for a wide variety of taxa
(angiosperm plants, birds, bats, freshwater
fishes) turned out to be the rectangular
hyperbola. On a logarithmic scale, the
relationship is a straight line described by the
equation.

log S = log C + Z log A

where

S = Species richness

A = Area

Z = Slope of the line
(regression coefficient)

C = Y-intercept


{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/zoology/unit5/flow5.5.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
lesson 1
{{< /figure >}}


Regression coefficient Z generally has a
value of 0.1-0.2 regardless of taxonomic group
or region. However, in case of the species –
area relationship in very large areas like entire
continents, the slope of the line appears to
be much steeper (Z-value in the range of
0.6-1.2). For example, in case of the fruit eating
(frugivorous) birds and mammals in the tropical
forests of different continents, the slope is found
to be a steeper line of 1.15 (Fig. 11.2).

**11.2 Importance of biodiversity – Global and India**

Biodiversity is the variety of life on earth.
That is, it is the number of different species of flora and fauna including microorganisms.
These organisms can inhabit different
ecosystems with varying conditions like the
Rainforests, Coral reefs, Grasslands, Deserts,
Tundra and the Polar ice caps. This variety
(Biodiversity) is essential for the wellbeing of
our planet and sustenance of life as a whole.
Ecologist Paul Ehrlich proposed the 'Rivet
Popper Hypothesis' for better understanding
the loss of each species in the ecosystem. He
compared each species of an ecosystem with
rivets in the body of an aeroplane. Thousands
of rivets (species) join all the parts of an
aeroplane (ecosystem). If every passenger
travelling in the aeroplane starts taking rivets
home(loss of species), initially it may not
affect flight safety (proper functioning of the
ecosystem). However, the plane becomes
dangerously weak over a period of time,
when more and more rivets are removed.
Moreover, which rivet is removed is also
important. When the key rivets (removal
of key stone species) on the wings of the
aeroplane are removed, undoubtedly it poses
a serious threat to the flight safety. Thus we
understand the role of every species for the
harmonial function of an ecosystem.

The importance of biodiversity can be
viewed and measured as

a) Ecosystem services

b) Biological resources

c) Social benefits of biodiversity

The organization and functioning
of ecosystems world over is effected and
dependent on biodiversity and its richness.
The major functional attributes are:

• continuity of nutrient cycles or
biogeochemical cycles (N<sub>2</sub>, C, H<sub>2</sub>O, P,S cycles)

• soil formation, conditioning or maintenance of soil health (fertility) by
soil microbial diversity along with the
different trophic members

• increases ecosystem productivity and
provide food resources

• act as water traps, filters, water flow
regulators and water purifiers (forest
cover and vegetation)

• climate stability (forests are essential for
rainfall, temperature regulation, CO2
absorption, which in turn regulate the
density and type of vegetation)

• forest resource management and
sustainable development

• maintaining balance between biotic
components

• cleaning up of pollutants – microbes
are the biggest degraders of molecules
including many anthropogenic ones
which are present in effluents, sewage,
garbage and agro-chemicals

• ecological stability – the varieties and
richness of species contribute to ecological stability and survival of species. Biodiverse
regions are reservoirs of biological
resources like food resources, gene pool,
genetic resource, medicinal resources,
bio-prospecting

• to provide unique aesthetic value and hot
spots for Ecotourism. Along with forest
resources and wildlife it has commercial
significance

• an indicator of the health of the ecosystem.
Endemism is a crucial indicator of
richness.

**11.3 Biogeographical regions of India**

As per the international ‘biome’ type
of classification based upon climate, fauna
and flora and the soil conditions, India can
be divided into ten different biogeographic
zones, (Fig. 11.3 and table 11.1) namely:

**11.4 Threats to biodiversity**

Even though India is one of the 17 identified
mega diverse countries of the world, it faces lots
of threats to its biodiversity.
Apart from natural causes, human
activities, both directly and indirectly are today’s
main reason for habitat loss and biodiversity
loss. Fragmentation and degradation
due to agricultural practices, extraction
(mining, fishing, logging, harvesting) and
development (settlements, industrial and
associated infrastructures) leads to habitat loss and fragmentation leads to formation of
isolated, small and scattered populations and as
endangered species.

Some of the other threats include
specialised diet, specialized habitat
requirement, large size, small population
size, limited geographic distribution and
high economic or commercial value. Large
mammals by virtue of their size require
larger areas to obtain the necessities of
life - food, cover, mates than do smaller
mammals. Individual home range of Lion can be about 100 square Km. Mammals have
specialized dietary needs such as carnivores,
frugivores and the need to forage over much
larger areas than general dietary herbivores
and omnivores. Mammals also have low
reproductive output other than small rodents.

{{< box title=" DID YOU KNOW" type="objective">}}
The interrelationship
and interdependence of
all living components
in a system can be seen
from the example of the
fruit bats of Guam (South East Asia). The
fruit bats are a delicacy here, and hence
their population has dwindled which is
not surprising. What is surprising is that
local fruit production has got affected
as it was identified that the bats served
as pollinators. Hence there is a need for
conservation of diversity as that could
avert such situations.
{{< /box >}}


**11.5 Causes of biodiversity loss**

The major causes for biodiversity decline are:

• Habitat loss, fragmentation and
destruction (affects about 73% of all
species)

• Pollution and pollutants (smog, pesticides,
herbicides, oil slicks, GHGs)

• Climate change

• Introduction of alien/exotic species

• Over exploitation of resources (poaching,
indiscriminate cutting of trees, over
fishing, hunting, mining)

• Intensive agriculture and aquacultural
practices

• Hybridization between native and non-
native species and loss of native species

• Natural disasters (Tsunami, forest fire,
earth quake, volcanoes)

• Industrialization, Urbanization,
infrastructure development, Transport –
Road and Shipping activity, communication
towers, dam construction, unregulated
tourism and monoculture are common area
of specific threats

• Co-extinction

**Habitat Loss**

Development of human society is
inevitable. Natural habitats are destroyed
for the purpose of settlement, agriculture,
mining, industries and construction of
highways. As a result species are forced to
adapt to the changes in the environment or
move to other places. If not, they become
victim to predation, starvation, disease and
eventually die or results in human animal
conflict.

Over population, urbanization,
industrialization and agricultural
advancements require additional land,
water and raw materials every year. This is
made possible only through fragmentation
or destruction of natural habitats by filling
wetlands, ploughing grasslands, cutting down
trees, forest, desilting rivers, constructing
transport ways, caving mountains, extracting,
ores, changing the course of rivers and filling
of seashore.
The most dramatic example of habitat
loss comes from the tropical rainforests 14% of
the earth’s land surface once covered by these
tropical forests, is not more than 6% now. The
Amazon rainforest, a vast area, harbouring
millions of species, also called “Lungs of the
planet”is destroyed and being replaced for
agriculture and human settlements. 90% of
New Zealand’s wetlands have been destroyed
and cleared for cultivating soya beans and
raising grass for beef cattle. Kodaikanal
and Nilgiri hills of Tamil Nadu have been destroyed rapidly for human occupancy. Loss
of habitat results in annihilation of plants,
microorganisms and forcing out animals
from their habitats.

{{< box title=" " type="">}}

**Where are the Sparrows?**

Common Sparrows are going extinct
because of mindless urbanization. They
are losing not just their natural habitats
but also the essential human touch they
need and thrive upon. The population of
sparrows is dwindling due to the use of
packed food, insecticides in farming and
changing lifestyles, and match box-styled
architecture resulting in an inadequate
availability of food and shelter for the birds.
Unlike pigeons that can make nests on
ledges, sparrows need cavities to build their
nests.
{{< /box >}}


**Habitat fragmentation**

Habitat fragmentation is the process
where a large, continuous area of habitat is
both, reduced in area and divided into two or
more fragments. Fragmentation of habitats
like forest land into crop lands, orchard lands,
plantations, urban areas, industrial estates,
transport and transit systems has resulted in the
destruction of complex interactions amongst
species, (food chain and webs) destruction of
species in the cleared regions, annihilation of
species restricted to these habitats (endemic)
and decreased biodiversity in the habitat
fragments. Animals requiring large territories
such as mammals and birds are severely
affected. The elephant corridors and migratory
routes are highly vulnerable. The dwindling
of many well-known birds (sparrows) and
animals can be attributed to this.

**Over exploitation:**

We depend on nature for our basic needs
such as food and shelter. However, when the need becomes greed, it leads to over
exploitation of natural resources. Excessive
exploitation of a species, reduces the size of
its population to such a level that it becomes
vulnerable to extinction. Dodo, passenger
pigeon and Steller’s sea cow have become
extinct in the last 200-300 years due to over
exploitation by humans. Overfishing due to
population pressure leads to many marine fish
(populations) declining around the world.

**Exotic species invasion:**

Exotic species (non-native; alien) are
organisms often introduced unintentionally
or deliberately for commercial purpose, as
biological control agents and other uses. They
often become invasive and drive away the local
species and is considered as the second major
cause for extinction of species. Exotic species
have proved harmful to both aquatic and
terrestrial ecosystems.
Tilapia fish (Jilabi kendai)
(Oreochromis mosambicus) introduced from
east coast of South Africa in 1952 for its high
productivity into Kerala’s inland waters, became
invasive, due to which the native species such
as Puntius dubius and Labeo kontius face local
extinction.
The introduction of the Nile Perch, a
predatory fish into Lake Victoria in East Africa
led to the extinction of an ecologically unique
assemblage of more than 200 nature species
of cichlid fish in the lake.
Papaya Mealy Bug (Paracoccus marginatus)
is native of Mexico and Central America, is
believed to have destroyed huge crops of papaya
in Assam, West Bengal and TamilNadu.

**Global Climate changes**

Industrialization is a major contributor
to climate change and a major threat to
biodiversity. Energy drives our industries,
which is provided by burning of fossil fuels.
This increases the emission of CO<sub>2</sub>, a GHG,
leading to climate change. Due to large scale
deforestation, the emitted CO<sub>2</sub> cannot be
absorbed fully, and its concentration in the
air increases. Climate change increases land
and ocean temperature, changes precipitation
patterns and raises the sea level. This
inturn results in melting of glaciers, water
inundation, less predictability of weather
patterns, extreme weather conditions,
outbreak of squalor diseases, migration of
animals and loss of trees in forest. Thus,
climate change is an imminent danger to the
existing biodiversity (Fig. 11.4).

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/zoology/unit5/flow5.6.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
lesson 1
{{< /figure >}}


**Shifting or Jhum cultivation (Slash-and-burn agriculture)**

In shifting cultivation, plots of natural
tree vegetation are burnt away and the cleared
patches are farmed for 2-3 seasons, after
which their fertility reduces to a point where
crop production is no longer profitable. The
farmer then abandons this patch and cuts
down a new patch of forest trees elsewhere
for crop production. This system is practiced
in north-eastern regions of India. When vast
areas are cleared and burnt, it results in loss of
forest cover, pollution and discharge of CO<sub>2</sub>
which in turn attributes to loss of habitat and
climate change which has an impact on the
faunal diversity of that regions.

**Coextinctions**

Coextinction of a species is the loss of
a species as a consequence of the extinction
of another. (Eg., orchid bees and forest trees
by cross pollination). Extinction of one will
automatically cause extinction of the other.
Another example for co-extinction is the
connection between Calvaria tree and the
extinct bird of Mauritius Island, the Dodo. The
Calvaria tree is dependent on the Dodo bird
for completion of its life cycle. The mutualistic
association is that the tough horny endocarp of
the seeds of Calvaria tree are made permeable
by the actions of the large stones in bird's
gizzard and digestive juices thereby facilitating
easier germination. The extinction of the Dodo
bird led to the imminent danger of the Calvaria
tree coextinction.

**Intensive agriculture**

Spread of agriculture is sometimes at
the cost of wetlands, grasslands and forests.
Intensive agriculture is based on a few high
yielding varieties. As a result, there is reduction
in the genetic diversity. It also increases
vulnerability of the crop plants to sudden attack
by pathogens and pests. There are only few
varieties of traditional paddy strains today due
to use to hybrid varieties in Tamil Nadu.

**11.5.1 Loss of biodiversity**

Species have been evolving and dying
out (extinction) ever since the origin of life.
However, species are now becoming extinct at
a faster rate. This is destabilizing the ecological
stability and the distribution of biological
diversity on earth. Human activities greatly
contribute to the loss of biodiversity. Natural
resources such as land, water and organisms
are indiscriminately exploited by human
beings.
According to the Convention of
Biological Diversity, direct and indirect
human activities have a detrimental effect on biodiversity. Direct human activities like
change in local land use, species introduction
or removal, harvesting, pollution and climate
change contribute a greater pressure on loss of
biodiversity. Indirect human drivers include
demographic, economic, technological, cultural
and religious factors.
Even though new species are being
discovered, there is little hope for adding new
species through speciation into the biodiversity
treasure. Monsoon failure, global warming,
depletion in ozone layer, landslides in hilly
states, pollution are a few indirect effects of
human activities which results in the loss
biodiversity. IUCN Red List (2004) documents
the extinction of 784 species in the 500 years.
It is estimated that the current rate of
biodiversity loss is 100 to 1000 times higher
than the naturally occurring extinction rate and
is still expected to grow in the future. This loss
of biodiversity has a immense impact on plant
animal and human life. The negative effects
include dramatic influence on the food web.
Even reduction in one species can adversely
affect the entire food chain which further leads
to an overall reduction in biodiversity. Reduced
biodiversity leads to immediate danger for food
security by reducing ecosystem services.

**11.5.2 Hotspots**

Hotspots are areas characterized with high
concentration of endemic species experiencing
unusual rapid rate of habitat modification loss.
Norman Myers defined hot spots as “regions
that harbour a great diversity of endemic species
and at the same time, have been significantly
impacted and altered by human activities.”
A hotspot is a region that supports at least
1500 endemic vascular plant species (0.5% of
the global total) has lost more than 70% of its
original vegetation. There are 35 biodiversity
hotspots in the world. India is home to four
biodiversity hotspots (as per ENVIS). They are 

a. Himalaya (the entire Indian Himalayan region)

b. Western Ghats

c. Indo-Burma: includes entire North-eastern
India, except Assam and Andaman group of
Islands (and Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam,
Laos, Cambodia and Southern China)

d. Sundalands: includes Nicobar group
of Islands (and Indonesia, Malaysia,
Singapore, Brunei, Philippines)

**11.5.3 Endangered organisms**

A species that has been categorized as
very likely to become extinct is an Endangered
species. Endangered (EN), as categorized by the
International Union for Conservation of Nature
(IUCN) Red List, is the second most severe
conservation status for wild populations in the
IUCN's scheme after Critically Endangered
(CR).
In 1998 there were1102 animal and 1197
plant species in the IUCN Red List. In 2012,
the list features 3079 animal and 2655 plant
species as endangered (EN) worldwide.

apexfulva) died on January 1, 2019, at
the age of 14. He was the last snail of his
species, and is emblematic of the loss of
native Hawaiian molluscs.

**11.5.4 Extinction**

Species is considered extinct when none
of its members are alive anywhere in the
world. If individuals of a species remain alive
only in captivity or other human controlled
conditions, the species is said to be extinct in the wild. In both of these situations, the species
would be considered globally extinct. A species
in considered to be locally extinct when it is no
longer found in an area it once inhabited but is
still found elsewhere in the wild.
In the 450 million years of life on Earth,
there had been 5 mass extinctions, which had
eliminated at least 50% of the species of flora
and fauna on the globe.
The extinction of species is mainly
due to drastic environmental changes and
population characteristics.

There are three types of Extinctions

i.Natural extinction is a slow process
of replacement of existing species with
better adapted species due to changes in
environmental conditions, evolutionary

Project Tiger: The Government of India
launched the ‘Project Tiger’ in 1973 to
protect our national animal. From 9 tiger
reserves since its inception, the Project
Tiger coverage has increased to 50 at
present. Project Tiger is an ongoing
Centrally Sponsored Scheme of the
Ministry of Environment and Forests,
providing central assistance to the states
for tiger conservation in designated tiger
reserves. Project Tiger was launched in the
Jim Corbett National Park, Uttarakhand
in1973. The project ensures a viable
population of Bengal tigers in their natural
habitats, protecting them from extinction
and preserving areas of biological
importance as a natural heritage.
The National Tiger Conservation
Authority (NTCA) is a statutory body of
the Ministry, created under the Wildlife
(Protection) Act, 1972. India holds over
half the world’s tiger population. According
to the latest tiger census report released on
20th January 2015 by NTCA, the current
tiger population is estimated at 2,212.

changes, predators and diseases. A small
population can get extinct sooner than the
large population due to inbreeding depression
(less adaptivity and variation).
ii. Mass extinction: The earth has experienced
quite a few mass extinctions due to
environmental catastrophes. A mass
extinction occurred about 225 million years
ago during the Permian, where 90% of shallow
water marine invertebrates disappeared.
iii. Anthropogenic extinctions These are
abetted by human activities like hunting,
habitat destruction, over exploitation,
urbanization and industrialization. Some
examples of extinctions are Dodo of
Mauritius and Steller’s sea cow of Russia.
Amphibians seem to be at higher risk of
extinction because of habitat destruction.
The most serious aspect of the loss of
biodiversity is the extinction of species. The
unique information contained in its genetic
material (DNA) and the niche it possesses are
lost forever.

**11.6 IUCN**

The International Union for Conservation
of Nature (IUCN) is an organization working in
the field of nature conservation and sustainable
use of natural resources. It was established in
1948 and located at Gland VD, Switzerland. It is
involved in data gathering and analysis research,
field projects and education on conservation,
sustainable development and biodiversity.
IUCN’s mission is to influence, encourage
and assist societies throughout the world to
conserve nature and to ensure that any use of
natural resources is equitable and ecologically
sustainable. It influences governments and
industries through partnerships by providing
information and advice. The organization
collects, compiles and publishes the IUCN red
list of threatened species and their conservation
status in the world. It plays a vital role in the implementation of several international
conventions on nature conservation and
biodiversity.

**Red Data Book**

Red Data book or Red list is a catalogue
of taxa facing risk of extinction. IUCN –
International Union of Conservation of Nature
and Natural Resources, which is renamed
as WCU – World Conservation Union
(Morges Switzerland) maintains the Red Data
book. The concept of Red list was mooted in
1963.The purpose of preparation of Red List
are:

• To create awareness on the degree of threat
to biodiversity

• Identification and documentation of species
at high risk of extinction

• Provide global index on declining
biodiversity

• Preparing conservation priorities and help
in conservation of action

• Information on international agreements on
conservation of biological diversity
Red list has eight categories of species

i) Extinct ii) Extinct in wild iii) Critically
Endangered iv) Endangered v) Vulnerable
vi) Lower risk vii) Data deficiency viii) Not
evaluated.

**11.7 Biodiversity and its conservation**

The natural resources
of the Earth, including air,
water, land, flora and fauna
of natural ecosystems must
be safeguarded for the
benefit of the present and future generations
through careful planning and management,
as appropriate – Principle of the Stockholm
Declaration, 1972.
The large-scale loss of biodiversity and
its global impact makes conservation the
need of the hour.
Conservation of biodiversity is protection
and scientific management of biodiversity
so as to maintain it at its optimum level and
derive sustainable benefits for the present as
well as future generations. It aims to protect
species from extinction and their habitats and
ecosystems from degradation.

General strategies in conservation

• identify and protect all threatened species

• identify and conserve in protected areas
the wild relatives of all the economically
important organisms

• identify and protect critical habitats for
feeding, breeding, nursing, resting of each
species

• resting, feeding and breeding places of
the organisms should be identified and
protected

• air, water and soil should be conserved on
priority basis

• wildlife Protection Act should be
implemented

There are two aspects of conservation strategies
(Table 11.4).

i) In-situ conservation

ii) Ex-situ conservation

**11.7.1 In-situ Conservation(Conservation in the natural habitat)**

This is the conservation of genetic
resources through their protection within a
natural or manmade ecosystem in which they
occur. It is conservation and protection of the
whole ecosystem and its biodiversity at all levels
in order to protect the threatened species.
Maximum protection of biodiversity
hotspots regions with very high levels of species
richness. Although all the biodiversity hotspots together cover less than 2 percent of the earth
land area, the number of species they harbour is
extremely high and protection of these hotspots
could reduce the ongoing mass.
Protected Areas
These are biogeographical areas where
biological diversity along with natural and
cultural resources is protected, maintained and
managed through legal measures. protected
areas include national parks, wild life sanctuaries,
community reserves and biosphere reserves.
World Conservation monitoring centre has
recognized 37,000 protected areas world-wide.
India has about 771 protected areas covering
162099 km<sup>2</sup>comprising of National Parks (104),
Wild Life Sanctuaries (544), biosphere reserves
(18) and several sacred groves.
National Parks (NP)
It is a natural habitat that is notified by
the state government to be constituted as a
National Park due to its ecological, faunal, floral,
geomorphological, or zoological association of
importance. No human activity is permitted
inside the national park except the activities
permitted by the Chief Wildlife Warden of the
state under the conditions given in CHAPTER
IV, of the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA) 1972
(Table 11.2).

There are 104 existing national parks in
India covering an area of 40,501 km<sup>2</sup>, which is 1.23% of the geographical area of the country (National Wildlife Database, Aug. 2018).
National Park is an area which is strictly reserved for the betterment of wildlife and biodiversity
and where activities like development, forestry,
poaching, hunting, grazing and cultivation are
not permitted. They are large areas of scenic
and national beauty maintained for scientific
educational and recreational use. They are not
used for commercial extraction of resources.
Kaziranga National park is a protected area for
the one Horned Rhinoceros in Assam.

**Wild Life Sanctuaries (WLS)**

Any area other than the area comprised with
any reserve forest or the territorial waters can be
notified by the State Government to constitute as
a sanctuary if such area is of adequate ecological,
faunal, floral, geomorphological, natural or
zoological significance. This is for the purpose
of protecting, endangered factual species. Some
restricted human activities are allowed inside
the Sanctuary area details of which are given in
CHAPTER IV, of the Wildlife Protection Act
(WPA) 1972. Ecoturism is permitted, as long as
animal life is undistrubed.
There are 544 existing wildlife sanctuaries in
India covering an area of 118,918 km2
, which is
3.62 % of the geographical area of the country
(National Wildlife Database, 2017).
Sanctuaries are tracts of land where wild
animals and fauna can take refuge without being
hunted or poached. Other activities like collection
of forest products, regulated harvesting of timber,
private ownership of land are permitted. Periyar
wild life sanctuary in Kerala is famous for the
Indian Tiger and Asiatic Elephant (Table 11.3).

**THE MADRAS CROCODILE BANK TRUST**

The Madras Crocodile Bank Trust and Centre
for Herpetology was the brain child of the
legendary Romulus Whitaker and a handful
of like-minded conservation visionaries, who
began work on the facility in 1976. It aimed to
save India’s dwindling crocodilian population.
The mission is to promote the conservation
of reptiles and amphibians and their habitats
through education, scientific research and
capture breeding. The crocodile bank remains a
world leader in the field of frontline conservation
and the preservation of natural landscapes. The
Crocodile Bank currently consists of a large
reptile park near Chennai and several field
projects located throughout the subcontinent
reaching as far as the Nicobar Islands. About
half a million people visit the bank every year,
making it one of the most popular tourist
attractions along the East Coast Road.

**Biosphere Reserve (BR):**

Biosphere Reserve (BR) is an international
designation by UNESCO for representative
parts of natural and cultural landscapes
extending over large area of terrestrial or
coastal/ marine ecosystems or a combination
thereof. BRs are designated to deal with the
conservation of biodiversity, economic and
social development and maintenance of
associated cultural values. Biosphere Reserves
are thus special environments for both people
and nature and are living examples of how
human beings and nature can co-exist while
respecting each other’s needs. The Biosphere
Reserve Programme is guided by UNESCO’s
Man and Biosphere (MAB) programme, as
India is a signatory to the landscape approach
supported by MAB programme. The scheme
called Biosphere Reserve was implemented
by the Government of India in 1986. There
are 18 Biosphere Reserves in the country.

**Arignar Anna Zoological Park, Vandalur**

Arignar Anna Zoological Park is spread
over an area of 602 hectares. of Reserve
Forest at Vandalur, Chennai. It is one of the
largest zoo in South East Asia in terms of
area. The Zoological Park exhibits different
classes of animals – it has around 2500 wild
animals of nearly 180 species which includes
Mammals, Birds and Reptiles. 34 years since
its establishment, the Zoological Park has
emerged as a successful ex-situ conservation
centre and a captive breeding centre for many
endangered species like Royal Bengal Tiger,
Lion Tailed Macaque, Nilgiri Langur, Gray
Wolf, etc.,
The Zoo has many attractive features like
Butterfly Park, Childrens Park, Walk Through
Aviary, Lion & Deer Safari, Forest Museum,
Interpretation centre, etc., which attracts
more than 21 lakh visitors every year. The
Zoo has strengthened its protection by means of installing CCTV Cameras for both visitors
and animal management under the name
of Zoo e-Eye. 24 x 7 Animal Live Streaming
was introduced for the benefit of the visitors
for the first time in the world. Vandalur Zoo
Mobile Application was introduced to provide
services to the visitors like facility to book
tickets, Zoo navigation, Animal information
in text and audio format. Digital payments at
ticket counters are also available.
The Zoo school has been involved
in education and outreach programmes.
One such successful programme is
‘Zoo Ambassador’ which is been conducted
for school children. In the year 2018, more
than 400 students were trained and titled as
Zoo Ambassadors. The Zoo also has a Rescue
Centre which accommodates rescued wild
animals and treats them to come out of stress.

Agasthyamalai (Karnataka - Tamil Nadu -
Kerala), Nilgiri (Tamil Nadu - Kerala), Gulf of
Mannar (Tamil Nadu) are the BRs notified in
Tamil Nadu.

**Sacred Groves**

A sacred grove or sacred woods are any
grove of trees that are of special religious
importance to a particular culture. Sacred
groves feature in various cultures throughout
the world.

**11.7.2 Ex-Situ Conservation**

It is conservation of selected rare plants/
animals in places outside their natural homes. It
includes offsite collections and gene banks.

**Offsite Collections**

They are live collections of wild and
domesticated species in Botanical gardens,
Zoological parks, Wildlife safari parks, Arborata
(gardens with trees and shrubs). The organisms
are well maintained for captive breeding
programmes. As a result, many animals which
have become extinct in the world continue to be
maintained in Zoological Parks. As the number
increases in captive breeding, the individuals
are selectively released in the wild. In this way
the Indian crocodile and gangetic dolphin have
been saved from extinction.

**Gene Banks**

Gene banks are a type of biorepository
which preserve genetic materials. Seeds of
different genetic strains of commercially
important plants can be stored in long periods
in seed banks, gametes of threatened species
can be preserved in viable and fertile condition
for long periods using cryopreservation
techniques.
However, it is not economically feasible
to conserve all biological wealth and all the
ecosystems. The number of species required
to be saved from extinction far exceeds the
conservation efforts.

**Summary:**

Biodiversity is the variety of all life on Earth,
encompassing genetic, species and ecosystem
diversity. Today’s biodiversity is the fruit of billions
of years of evolution, shaped by natural processes
and, increasingly, by the influence of humans. To
date, about two million species have been identified
on Earth.
Biodiversity supplies a large number of goods
and services that sustain human life, including
the provision of food, fuel and building materials;
purification of air and water; stabilization and
moderation of the earth’s climate; moderation
of floods, droughts, temperature extremes and
wind forces; generation and renewal of soil health;
maintenance of genetic resources as inputs to crop
varieties and livestock breeds, medicines, and other
products; and cultural, recreational and aesthetic
benefits.
Over the past few hundred years, biodiversity
has faced major challenges, including a growing
demand for biological resources caused by
population growth and increased consumption.
This increased exploitation of biological resources
has resulted in the loss of species at levels currently
estimated to be 100 times faster than the natural
rate of loss prior to significant human intervention.
Though many species were lost and new ones
formed, it is likely we will lose all this natural
wealth in less than two centuries, if the present rate
of biodiversity losses persist.
The biodiversity and its conservation is the
important global issue of international concern.
Recognition of this problem has made scientists and
policy makers to work and develop mechanisms
to document, conserve and sustainably use
biodiversity.
The younger generation should be made to
realize the critical state of biodiversity today and
volunteer to protect and conserve it, so as to enable
the future generations get to enjoy the benefits of
Nature.
