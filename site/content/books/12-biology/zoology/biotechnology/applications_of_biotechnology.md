Before we start this chapter, it will be helpful
if you revise the structure of DNA, Protein
synthesis and genetic engineering. Genetic
engineering involves the manipulation of DNA
and naturally occurring processes such as protein
synthesis for a wide range of applications including
the production of therapeutically important
proteins. This also involves extracting a gene from
one organism and transferring it to the DNA of
another organism, of the same or another species.
The DNA produced in this way is referred to as
recombinant DNA (rDNA) and this technique as
recombinant DNA technology. All these are part of
the broad field biotechnology which can be defined
as the applications of scientific and engineering
principles to the processing of material by biological
agents to provide goods and services.

Biotechnology is an umbrella term that covers
various techniques for using the properties of
living things to make products or provide services.
The term biotechnology was first used before
20th century for such traditional activities as
making idli, dosa, dairy products, bread or
wine, but none of these would be considered
biotechnology in the modern sense.

In this chapter we will study the applications
of bio-technology in various fields including
the field of Medicine. Recombinant DNA
technology has led to the large scale
production of various hormones and proteins
of therapeutic use.

### Applications in Medicine  

#### Recombinant Human Insulin
The Human insulin is synthesized by the
β cells of Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. It
is formed of 51 aminoacids which are arranged
in two polypeptide chains, A and B. The
polypeptide chain A has 21 amino acids while
the polypeptide chain B has 30 amino acids.
Both A and B chains are attached together by
disulphide bonds. Insulin controls the levels
of glucose in blood. It facilitates the cellular
uptake and utilization of glucose for the
release of energy. Deficiency of insulin leads
to diabetes mellitus which is characterized by
increased blood glucose concentration and
a complex of symptoms which may lead to
death, if untreated. A continuous program of
insulin dependence is required to treat this
deficiency.

In the early years, insulin isolated and
purified from the pancreas of pigs and cows
was used to treat diabetic patients. Due
to minor differences in the structure of
the animal insulin as compared to human
insulin, it resulted in the occurrence of
allergic reactions in some diabetic patients.
Production of insulin by recombinant DNA
technology started in the late 1970s. This
technique involved the insertion of human
insulin gene on the plasmids of E.coli. The
polypeptide chains are synthesized as a
precursor called pre-pro insulin, which
contains A and B segments linked by a third
chain (C) and preceded by a leader sequence.
The leader sequence is removed after
translation and the C chain is excised, leaving
the A and B polypeptide chains **(Fig. 9.1)**.

Insulin was the first ever pharmaceutical
product of recombinant DNA technology
administered to humans. The approval to use
recombinant insulin for diabetes mellitus was
given in 1982. In 1986 human insulin was
marketed under the trade name Humulin.

Best and Banting in 1921, isolated insulin from
the pancreatic islets of a dog and demonstrated
its effectiveness against diabetes.

 In 1997, Rosie, the first
transgenic cow produced
human protein enriched
milk, which contained the
human alpha lactalbumin. The protein
rich milk (2.4 gm/litre) was a nutritionally
balanced food for new born babies than
the normal milk produced by the cows.

#### Interferons 
Interferons are proteinaceous, antiviral,
species specific substances produced by
mammalian cells when infected with viruses.
Interferons were discovered by Alick Isaacs and
Jean Lindemann in 1957. Based on the structure
of interferons they are classified as α, β and γ
interferons. They stimulate the cellular DNA to
produce antiviral enzymes which inhibit viral
replication and protect the cells. Interferons
could be isolated from blood, but the amount
of blood required for isolation of interferons is
enormous and not practical. To overcome this
issue interferons could be produced by rDNA
technology. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
is more suitable for production of recombinant
interferons than E.coli, since E.coli does not
possess the machinery for glycosylation of
proteins. Interferons are used for the treatment
of various diseases like cancer, AIDS, multiple
sclerosis, hepatitis C and herpes zoster. In spite
of the therapeutic applications interferons are
not within the reach of the common man due to
high cost for its production.

#### Recombinant Vaccines Recombinant DNA technology 

Recombinant DNA technology has been
used to produce new generation vaccines. The
limitations of traditional vaccine production
could be overcome by this approach.

The recombinant vaccines are generally of
uniform quality and produce less side effects as
compared to the vaccines produced by conventional
methods. Different types of recombinant vaccines
include subunit recombinant vaccines, attenuated
recombinant vaccines and DNA vaccines.

**Subunit recombinant vaccines**

Vaccines that use components of a pathogenic
organism rather than the whole organism are called
**subunit vaccines;** recombinant DNA technology
is very suited for developing new subunit vaccines.
It includes components like proteins, peptides and
DNAs of pathogenic organisms. The advantages of
these vaccines include their purity in preparation,
stability and safe use.

**Attenuated recombinant vaccines**

This includes genetically modified
pathogenic organisms (bacteria or viruses)
that are made nonpathogenic and are used
as vaccines. It is now possible to genetically
engineer the organisms (bacteria or viruses) and
use them as live vaccines and such vaccines are
referred to as attenuated recombinant vaccines.


{{< box title=" **DO YOU KNOW**??" type="objective" >}}

Edible vaccines are prepared by molecular
pharming using the science of genetic
engineering. Selected genes are introduced
into plants and the transgenic plants are
induced to manufacture the encoded protein.
Edible vaccines are mucosal targeted vaccines
which cause stimulation of both systemic and
mucosal immune response. At present edible
vaccines are produced for human and animal
diseases like measles, cholera, foot and mouth
disease and hepatitis.

{{< /box >}}

**DNA Vaccines**

Genetic immunisation by using DNA
vaccines is a novel approach that came into
being in 1990. The immune response of the
body is stimulated by a DNA molecule. A
DNA vaccine consists of a gene encoding an
antigenic protein, inserted onto a plasmid,
and then incorporated into the cells in a
target animal. DNA instructs the cells to make
antigenic molecules which are displayed on
its surfaces. This would evoke an antibody
response to the free floating antigen secreted
by the cells. The DNA vaccine cannot cause
the disease as it contains only copies of a few
of its genes. DNA vaccines are relatively easy
and inexpensive to design and produce.

Vaccines produced by these new techniques
have definite advantages like producing target
proteins, long lasting immunity and trigger
immune response only against specific
pathogens with less toxic effects.

Recombinant hepatitis B vaccine as
a subunit vaccine is produced by cloning
hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) gene in
the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae **(Fig. 9.2).**

## <u>9.2 Gene Therapy 

If a person is born with a hereditary
disease, can a corrective therapy be given for
such disease? Yes, this can be done by a process
known as gene therapy. This process involves
the transfer of a normal gene into a person’s
cells that carries one or more mutant alleles.
Expression of normal gene in the person results
in a functional gene product whose action
produces a normal phenotype. Delivery of the
normal gene is accomplished by using a vector.
The main thrust of gene therapy has been
directed at correcting single gene mutations as
in cystic fibrosis and haemophilia. At present
most genetic diseases have no effective treatment
and so gene therapy could offer hope for many
people. There are two strategies involved in
gene therapy namely; **Gene augmentation**
therapy which involves insertion of DNA into
the genome to replace the missing gene product
and Gene inhibition therapy which involves
insertion of the anti sense gene which inhibits
the expression of the dominant gene **(Fig. 9.3)**.

The two approaches to achieve gene therapy
are **somatic** cell and germ **line gene therapy.**

{{< box title=" DO YOU KNOW ??" type="objective" >}}

The recombinant vaccine for hepatitis B (HbsAg) was the first synthetic vaccine launched in 1997
which was marketed by trade names Recombivax and Engerix-B. India is the fourth country in
the world after USA, France and Belgium to develop an indigenous hepatitis B vaccine.

Fig. 9.2 Production of recombinant HB Vaccine
{{< /figure >}}

Somatic cell therapy involves the insertion of
a fully functional and expressible gene into a
target somatic cell to correct a genetic disease
permanently whereas Germline gene therapy
involves the introduction of DNA into germ cells
which is passed on to the successive generations.
Gene therapy involves isolation of a specific
gene and making its copies and inserting them
into target cells to make the desired proteins.
It is absolutely essential for gene therapists to
ensure that the gene is harmless to the patient
and it is appropriately expressed and that the
body’s immune system does not react to the
foreign proteins produced by the new genes.

The first clinical gene therapy was given in 1990 by French Anderson to a four
year old girl with adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. ADA deficiency or SCID
(Severe combined immunodeficiency) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. It is
caused by the deletion or dysfunction of the gene coding for ADA enzyme. In these patients
the nonfunctioning T-Lymphocytes cannot elicit immune responses against invading
pathogens. The right approach for SCID treatment would be to give the patient a functioning
ADA which breaks down toxic biological products.

In some children ADA deficiency could be cured by bone marrow transplantation,
where defective immune cells could be replaced with healthy immune cells from a donor. In
some patients it can be treated by enzyme replacement therapy, in which functional ADA is
injected into the patient.

During gene therapy the lymphocytes from the blood of the patient are removed and
grown in a nutrient culture medium. A healthy and functional human gene, ADA cDNA
encoding this enzyme is introduced into the lymphocytes using a retrovirus. The genetically
engineered lymphocytes are subsequently returned to the patient. Since these cells are not
immortal, the patient requires periodic infusion of such genetically engineered lymphocytes.
The disease could be cured permanently if the gene for ADA isolated from bone marrow cells
are introduced into the cells of the early embryonic stages.

Fig. 9.3 Process of gene therapy
{{< /figure >}}


In mammals there are two main types of
stem cells – embryonic stem cells (ES cells)
and adult stem cells. ES cells are pluripotent
and can produce the three primary germ
layers ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm.
Embryonic stem cells are multipotent stem
cells that can differentiate into a number of
types of cells (Fig.9.4). ES cells are isolated
from the epiblast tissue of the inner cell mass
of a blastocyst. When stimulated ES can
develop into more than 200 cells types of the
adult body. ES cells are immortal i.e., they can
proliferate in a sterile culture medium and
maintain their undifferentiated state.

Adult stem cells are found in various tissues
of children as well as adults. An adult stem cell or
somatic stem cell can divide and create another
cell similar to it. Most of the adult stem cells are
multipotent and can act as a repair system of the
body, replenishing adult tissues. The red bone
marrow is a rich source of adult stem cells.

The most important and potential
application of human stem cells is the generation
of cells and tissues that could be used for cell
based therapies. Human stem cells could be used
to test new drugs.


{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic50.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
Fig. 9.4 Embryonic stem cells
{{< /figure >}}


{{< box >}}

**Totipotency (Toti-total)** is the ability
of a single cell to divide and produce all of
the differentiated cells in an organism.


**Pluripotency (Pluri-several)** refers to a
stem cell that has the potential to differentiate
into any of the three germ layers-ectoderm,
endoderm and mesoderm.

**Multipotency (multi-Many)** refers
to the stem cells that can differentiate into
various types of cells that are related. For
example blood stem cells can differentiate
into lymphocytes, monocytes , neutrophils
etc.,

**Oligopotency (Oligo-Few)** refers to
stem cells that can differentiate into few cell
types. For example lymphoid or myeloid
stem cells can differentiate into B and T cells
but not RBC.

**Unipotency** ( Uni- Single) refers to the
ability of the stem cells to differentiate into
only one cell type.


**Stem Cell Banks**
Stem cell banking is the extraction,
processing and storage of stem cells, so that
they may be used for treatment in the future,
when required. Amniotic cell bank is a facility
that stores stem cells derived from amniotic
fluid for future use. Stem cells are stored in
banks specifically for use by the individual
from whom such cells have been collected
and the banking costs are paid. Cord Blood
Banking is the extraction of stem cells from
the umbilical cord during childbirth. While
the umbilical cord and cord blood are the most
popular sources of stem cells, the placenta,
amniotic sac and amniotic fluid are also rich
sources in terms of both quantity and quality.

### Molecular Diagnostics 

Early diagnosis of infectious diseases
or inherent genetic defects is essential for
appropriate treatment. Early detection of the
disease is not possible using conventional
diagnostic methods like microscopic
examinations, serum analysis and urine
analysis. These laboratory techniques are
indirect and not always specific. Scientists
are continuously searching for specific,
sensitive and simple diagnostic techniques
for diagnosis of diseases. Recombinant DNA
technology, Polymerase Chain Reactions
(PCR) and Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent
Assay (ELISA) are some of the techniques
that are reliable and help in early diagnosis.
Presence of pathogens like virus, bacteria,
etc., is detected only when the pathogen
produces symptoms in the patient. By the
time the symptoms appear concentration
of pathogen becomes very high in the body.
However very low concentration of a bacteria
or a virus, even when the symptoms of the
disease does not appear, can be detected by
amplification of their nucleic acid.

**ELISA [Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay]**

ELISA is a biochemical procedure
discovered by **Eva Engvall** and
**Peter Perlmanin (1971)** to detect the presence
of specific antibodies or antigens in a sample
of serum, urine, etc., It is a very important
diagnostic tool to determine if a person is
HIV positive or negative. ELISA is a tool for
determining serum antibody concentrations
(such as the antibodies produced in a person
infected by pathogens such as HIV) and also
for detecting the presence of specific antigens
and hormones such as human chorionic
gonadotropins.

During diagnosis the sample suspected
to contain the antigen is immobilized on
the surface of an ELISA plate **(Fig. 9.5)**. The
antibody specific to this antigen is added
and allowed to react with the immobilized
antigen. The anti-antibody is linked to an
appropriate enzyme like peroxidase. The
unreacted anti-antbody is washed away
and the substrate of the enzyme (hydrogen
peroxidase) is added with certain reagents
such as 4-chloronaphthol. The activity of the
enzyme yields a coloured product indicating
the presence of the antigen. The intensity
of the colour is directly proportional to
the amount of the antigen. ELISA is highly
sensitive and can detect antigens in the range
of a nanogram.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic51.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
Fig. 9.5 Enzyme Linked Immuno
{{< /figure >}}


There are four kinds of ELISA namely,
Direct ELISA, Indirect ELISA, sandwich
ELISA and competitive ELISA. It is a
highly sensitive and specific method used
for diagnosis. ELISA possesses the added
advantages of not requiring radioisotopes or
a radiation counting apparatus.

**PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)**

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
is an invitro amplification technique
used for synthesising multiple identical
copies (billions) of DNA of interest. The
technique was developed by **Kary Mullis**
(Nobel laureate, 1993) in the year 1983.

Denaturation, renaturation or primer
annealing and synthesis or primer extension,
are the three steps involved in PCR **(Fig. 9.6).**
The double stranded DNA of interest is
denatured to separate into two individual
strands by high temperature . This is called
**denaturation**. Each strand is allowed to
hybridize with a primer (renaturation or
primer annealing). The primer template is
used to synthesize DNA by using Taq – DNA
polymerase.

During denaturation the reaction
mixture is heated to 950

C for a short time to
denature the target DNA into single strands
that will act as a template for DNA synthesis.
Annealing is done by rapid cooling of the
mixture, allowing the primers to bind to the
sequences on each of the two strands flanking
the target DNA. During primer extension or
synthesis the temperature of the mixture is
increased to 750

C for a sufficient period of
time to allow Taq DNA polymerase to extend
each primer by copying the single stranded
template. At the end of incubation both single
template strands will be made partially double
stranded. The new strand of each double
stranded DNA extends to a variable distance
downstream. These steps are repeated again
and again to generate multiple forms of the
desired DNA. This process is also called DNA
amplification.

The PCR technique can also be used
for amplifications of RNA in which case
it is referred to as reverse transcription
PCR (RT-PCR). In this process the RNA
molecules (mRNA) must be converted to
complementary DNA by the enzyme reverse
transcriptase. The cDNA then serves as the
template for PCR.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic52.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
Fig. 9.6 Steps involved in PCR
{{< /figure >}}

**PCR In Clinical Diagnosis**

The specificity and sensitivity of PCR
is useful for the diagnosis of inherited
disorders (genetic diseases), viral diseases,
bacterial diseases, etc., The diagnosis and
treatment of a particular disease often
requires identifying a particular pathogen.
Traditional methods of identification involve
culturing these organisms from clinical
specimens and performing metabolic and
other tests to identify them. The concept
behind PCR based diagnosis of infectious
diseases is simple – if the pathogen is present
in a clinical specimen its DNA will be present.
Its DNA has unique sequences that can be
detected by PCR, often using the clinical
specimen (for example, blood, stool, spinal
fluid, or sputum) in the PCR mixture. PCR
is also employed in the prenatal diagnosis
of inherited diseases by using chorionic
villi samples or cells from amniocentesis.
Diseases like sickle cell anemia, β-thalassemia
and phenylketonuria can be detected by
PCR in these samples. cDNA from PCR is a
valuable tool for diagnosis and monitoring
retroviral infections e.g., Tuberculosis by
*Mycobacterium tuberculosis.*


Several virally induced cancers, like
cervical cancer caused by Papilloma virus
can be detected by PCR. Sex of human beings
and live stocks, embryos fertilized **invitro** can
be determined by PCR by using primers and
DNA probes specific for sex chromosomes.
PCR technique is also used to detect
sex-linked disorders in fertilized embryos.

**Applications of PCR**

The differences in the genomes of
two different organisms can be studied by
PCR. PCR is very important in the study of
evolutions, more specifically phylogenetics.
As a technique which can amplify even
minute quantities of DNA from any source,
like hair, mummified tissues, bones or any
fossilized materials.

PCR technique can also be used in the
field of forensic medicine . A single molecule
of DNA from blood stains, hair, semen of
an individual is adequate for amplification
by PCR. The amplified DNA is used to
develop DNA fingerprint which is used as an
important tool in forensic science. Thus, PCR
is very useful for identification of criminals.
PCR is also used in amplification of specific
DNA segment to be used in gene therapy.

### Transgenic Animals 
In early days selective breeding
methods were carried out to improve the
genetic characteristics of live stock and
other domestic animals. With the advent of
modern biotechnology it is possible to carry
out manipulations at the genetic level to get
the desired traits in animals. Transgenesis
is the process of introduction of extra
(foreign/exogenous) DNA into the genome
of the animals to create and maintain stable
heritable characters. The foreign DNA
that is introduced is called the transgene
and the animals that are produced by DNA
manipulations are called **transgenic animals**
or the **genetically engineered** or genetically
modified organisms.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic53.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
Fig. 9. 7 Production of transgenic animals 
{{< /figure >}}

The various steps involved in the
production of transgenic organisms are

• Identification and separation of desired
gene.

• Selection of a vector (generally a virus) or
direct transmission.

• Combining the desired gene with the vector.

• Introduction of transferred vector
into cells, tissues, embryo or mature
individual.

• Demonstration of integration and
expression of foreign gene in transgenic
tissue or animals. Transgenic animals such
as mice, rat, rabbit, pig, cow, goat, sheep
and fish have been produced **(Fig. 9.7)**.

### <u> Uses Of Transgenesis 

• Transgenesis is a powerful tool to study
gene expression and developmental
processes in higher organisms.

• Transgenesis helps in the improvement of
genetic characters in animals. Transgenic
animals serve as good models for
understanding human diseases which
help in the investigation of new treatments
for diseases. Transgenic models exist for
many human diseases such as cancer,
Alzheimer’s, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid
arthritis and sickle cell anemia.

• Transgenic animals are used to produce
proteins which are important for medical
and pharmaceutical applications.

• Transgenic mice are used for testing the
safety of vaccines.

• Transgenic animals are used for testing
toxicity in animals that carry genes which
make them sensitive to toxic substances
than non-transgenic animals exposed
to toxic substances and their effects are
studied.

• Transgenesis is important for improving
the quality and quantity of milk, meat,
eggs and wool production in addition to
testing drug resistance.

### Biological products and their uses 
A biological product is a substance
derived from a living organism and used for
the prevention or treatment of disease. These
products include antitoxins, bacterial and
viral vaccines, blood products and hormone
extracts. These products may be produced
through biotechnology in a living system, such
as a microorganism, plant cell or animal cell,
and are often more difficult to characterize than
small molecule drugs. Through recombinant
DNA technology it is possible to produce these
biological products on demand. There are
many types of biological products approved
for use -they are, therapeutic proteins,
monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Health
care and pharmaceutical industries have been
revolutionised by biotechnological proteins.
Hormones and antibodies are produced
commercially, primarily for the medical
industry. Recombinant hormones like Insulin,
Human growth hormone, Recombinant
vaccines and recombinant proteins like human
alpha lactalbumin are available today.

Animals are used as bioreactors to produce
desirable proteins. Antibodies are substances
that react against the disease causing antigens
and these can be produced using transgenic
animals as bioreactors. Monoclonal antibodies,
which are used to treat cancer, heart disease
and transplant rejection are produced by this
technology. Natural protein adhesives are
non toxic, biodegradable and rarely trigger
an immune response, hence could be used
to reattach tendons and tissues, fill cavities in
teeth, and repair broken bones.

### Animal Cloning  

Cloning is the process of producing
genetically identical individuals of an organism
either naturally or artificially. In nature many
organisms produce clones through asexual
reproduction.

Cloning in biotechnology refers to the
process of creating copies of organisms or copies
of cells or DNA fragments (molecular cloning).

Dolly was the first mammal (Sheep)
clone developed by Ian Wilmut and Campbell
in 1997. Dolly, the transgenic clone was
developed by the nuclear transfer technique
and the phenomenon of totipotency.

**Totipotency** refers to the potential of a cell
to develop different cells, tissues, organs and
finally an organism.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic54.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
Fig. 9. 8 Cloning of dolly 
{{< /figure >}}

The mammary gland udder cells
(somatic cells) from a donor sheep (ewe) were
isolated and subjected to starvation for 5 days.
The udder cells could not undergo normal
growth cycle, entered a dormant stage and
became totipotent. An ovum (egg cell) was
taken from another sheep (ewe) and its nucleus
was removed to form an enucleated ovum. The
dormant mammary gland cell/udder cell and
the enucleated ovum were fused. The outer
membrane of the mammary cell was ruptured
allowing the ovum to envelope the nucleus.
The fused cell was implanted into another
ewe which served as a surrogate mother. Five
months later dolly was born. Dolly was the
first animal to be cloned from a differentiated
somatic cell taken from an adult animal
without the process of fertilization **(Fig. 9.8)**.


{{< box title=" DO YOU KNOW ??" type="objective" >}}

Ian Wilmut and Campbell
removed 277 cells from
the udder of an adult
sheep and fused those
cells with 277 unfertilised
egg cells from which the nuclear material
was removed. After culturing the resulting
embryos for 6 days , they implanted 29
embryos into the surrogate mother's womb
and only one Dolly was produced.

### <u> Advantages and Disadvantages Of Cloning Animals 

• Offers benefits for clinical trials and medical
research. It can help in the production of
proteins and drugs in the field of medicine.

• Aids stem cell research.

• Animal cloning could help to save endangered
species.

• Animal and human activists see it as a threat
to biodiversity saying that this alters evolution
which will have an impact on populations and
the ecosystem.

• The process is tedious and very expensive.

• It can cause animals to suffer.

• Reports show that animal surrogates were
manifesting adverse outcomes and cloned
animals were affected with disease and have
high mortality rate.

• It might compromise human health through
consumption of cloned animal meat.

• Cloned animals age faster than normal
animals and are less healthy than the parent
organism as discovered in Dolly.

• Cloning can lead to occurrence of genetic
disorders in animals.

• More than 90% of cloning attempts fail to
produce a viable offspring.

A gene ‘knock out’ is a genetically
engineered organism that carries one or
more genes in its chromosomes that have
been made inoperative.

### <u>9.8 Ethical Issues

Biotechnology has given to the society cheap
drugs, better friuts and vegetables, pest resistant
crops, indigenious cure to diseases and lot of
controversy. This is mainly because the major
part of the modern biotechnology deals with
genetic manipulations. People fear that these
genetic manipulations may lead to unknown
consequences. The major apprehension
of recombinant DNA technology is that
unique microorganisms either inadvertently
or deliberately for the purpose of war may
be developed that could cause epidemics or
environmental catastrophies. Although many
are concerned about the possible risk of genetic
engineering, the risks are in fact slight and the
potential benefits are substantial.




## Summary

Biotechnology is defined as “any
technological application that uses biological
systems, living organisms or derivatives thereof,
to make or modify products or processes for
specific use”. In 1919, Hungarian agricultural
engineer Karl Ereky coined the term
Biotechnology. Biotechnology includes two
major technologies, Genetic engineering and
Chemical engineering.

Biotechnology has application in four
major industrial areas, including health
care (medical) agriculture, industrial and
environment. Biotechnology techniques are
used in the field of medicine for diagnosis,
prevention and treatment of different diseases.
Production of recombinant hormones, and
recombinant interferons have helped in the
treatment of diseases. Recombinant vaccines
have been used to prevent various diseases. The
recombinant vaccines are of three types- subunit
recombinant vaccines, attenuated recombinant
vaccines and gene recombinant vaccines.

Genetic defects could be corrected by a process
called Gene therapy. It is of two types somatic cell
gene therapy and germline gene therapy.

Stem cells are undifferentiated cells found
in multicellular organisms. These cells are of
two types -Embryonic stem cells and adult stem
cells. Stem cells have the ability to regenerate
damaged and diseased organs. Recombinant
DNA technology, Polymerase chain reaction
and Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay are
techniques that are reliable and help in early
diagnosis.

Transgenesis is the process of introduction
of a foreign gene into the genome of animals to
create and maintain stable heritable characters.

A biological product is a substance derived
from a living organism and used for the
prevention or treatment of diseases.

Cloning is the process of producing
genetically identical individuals of an organism
either naturally or artificially.

Advances in Biotechnology and their
applications are most frequently associated with
controversies, ethical issues and concerns.
