The term evolution is used to describe
heritable changes in one or more
characteristics of a population of species from
one generation to the other. The present state
of mankind on earth is the outcome of three
kinds of evolution - chemical, organic and
social or cultural evolution.


Radiometric dating of meteorites yields
an estimated age for the solar system and for
earth as around 4.5 – 4.6 billion years. The
new born earth remained inhospitable for at
least few hundred millions years. At first it
was too hot. This is because the collisions of
the planetesimals that coalesced to form earth
released much heat to melt the entire planet.
Eventually outer surface of the earth cooled
and solidified to form a crust. Water vapour
released from the planet’s interior cooled
and condensed to form oceans. Hence origin
of life can be reconstructed using indirect
evidences. Consequently, biologists have
turned to gather disparate bits of information
and filling them together like pieces of jig saw
puzzle. Many theories have been proposed
to explain the origin of life. Few have been
discussed in this chapter.

## <u>6.1 Origin of life – Evolution of life forms  </u>


Theory of special creation states that
life was created by a supernatural power,
respectfully referred to as “God”. According
to Hinduism, Lord Brahma created the Earth.
Christianity, Islam and most religions believe
that God created the universe, the plants and
the animals.

According to the t**heory of spontaneous generation** or Abiogenesis, living organisms
originated from non-living materials and
occurred through stepwise chemical and
molecular evolution over millions of years.
Thomas Huxley coined the term abiogenesis.

**Big bang theory**explains the origin
of universe as a singular huge explosion
in physical terms. The primitive earth had
no proper atmosphere, but consisted of
ammonia, methane, hydrogen and water
vapour. The temperature of the earth was
extremely high. UV rays from the sun split
up water molecules into hydrogen and
oxygen. Gradually the temperature cooled
and the water vapour condensed to form rain.
Rain water filled all the depressions to form
water bodies. Ammonia and methane in the
atmosphere combined with oxygen to form
carbon-dioxide and other gases.

Coacervates (large colloidal particles
that precipitate out in aqueous medium)
are the first pre-cells which gradually
transformed into living cells.

{{< /box >}}

According to the **theory of biogenesis**
life arose from pre-existing life. The term
biogenesis also refers to the biochemical
process of production of living organisms
This term was coined by Henry Bastian.

According to the **theory of chemical**
**evolution** primitive organisms in the
primordial environment of the earth evolved
spontaneously from inorganic substances and
physical forces such, as lightning, UV radiations,
volcanic activities, etc.,., Oparin (1924)
suggested that the organic compounds could
have undergone a series of reactions leading
to more complex molecules. He proposed that
the molecules formed colloidal aggregates or
‘coacervates’ in an aqueous environment. The
coacervates were able to absorb and assimilate
organic compounds from the environment.
Haldane (1929) proposed that the primordial
sea served as a vast chemical laboratory
powered by solar energy. The atmosphere
was oxygen free and the combination of CO2,
NH3 and UV radiations gave rise to organic
compounds. The sea became a ‘hot’ dilute
soup containing large populations of organic
monomers and polymers. They envisaged that
groups of monomers and polymers acquired
lipid membranes and further developed into
the first living cell. Haldane coined the term
prebiotic soup and this became the powerful
symbol of the Oparin-Haldane view on the
origin of life (1924-1929).
Oparin and Haldane independently
suggested that if the primitive atmosphere was
reducing and if there was appropriate supply
of energy such as lightning or UV light then
a wide range of organic compounds can be
synthesized.


### <u> 6.2 Geological time scale </u>

The duration of the earth’s history has been
divided into **eras** that include
the **Paleozoic, Mesozoic**,
and **Cenozoic**. Recent eras
are further divided into
**periods, which are split into**
**epochs**. The geological time
scale with the duration of the
eras and periods with the dominant forms of
life is shown in **Table 6.1.**

The Paleozoic era is characterized by
abundance of fossils of marine invertebrates.
Towards the later half, other vertebrates (marine
and terrestrial) except birds and mammals
appeared. The six periods of Paleozoic era
in order from oldest to the youngest are
Cambrian (Age of invertebrates), Ordovician
(fresh water fishes, Ostracoderms, various
types of Molluscs), Silurian (origin of fishes),
Devonian (Age of fishes, many types of fishes
such as lung fishes, lobe finned fishes and
ray finned fishes), Mississippian (earliest
amphibians, Echinoderms), Pennsylvanian
(earliest reptiles), Permian (mammal like
reptiles).

**Mesozoic era** (dominance of reptiles)
called the **Golden age of reptiles**, is
divided into three periods namely,
Triassic (origin of egg laying mammals),

![](/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic37.png)

Jurassic (Dinosaurs were dominant on the
earth, fossil **bird – Archaeopteryx)** and
Cretaceous (extinction of toothed birds and
dinosaurs, emergence of modern birds).

**Cenozoic era** (Age of mammals)
is subdivided into two periods namely
Tertiary and Quaternary. Tertiary period is
characterized by abundant mammalian fauna.
This period is subdivided into five epochs
namely, Paleocene (placental mammals,
Eocene (Monotremes except duck billed
Platypus and Echidna, hoofed mammals and
carnivores), Oligocene (higher placental
mammals appeared), Miocene (origin of
first man like apes) and Pliocene (origin of
man from man like apes).Quaternary period
witnessed decline of mammals and beginning
of human social life.
The age of fossils can be determined
using two methods namely, relative dating
and absolute dating. **Relative dating** is used to
determine a fossil by comparing it to similar
rocks and fossils of known age. **Absolute dating** is used to determine the precise age
of a fossil by using radiometric dating to
measure the decay of isotopes.

## <u> 6.3 Biological evolution </u>

**Formation of protobionts**

Abiotically produced molecules can
spontaneously self assemble into droplets
that enclose a watery solution and maintain
a chemical environment different from their
surroundings. Scientists call these spheres
as ‘protobionts’. Liposomes are lipids in a
solution that can self assemble into a lipid
bilayer. Some of the proteins inside the
liposomes acquired the properties of enzymes
resulting in fast multiplication of molecules.
The coacervates with nucleoprotein and
nutrients had a limiting surface membrane that
had the characters of a virus or free living genes.
Sub sequently number of genes united to form
‘proto viruses’ somewhat similar to present day

The coacervates with nucleoprotein and
nutrients had a limiting surface membrane that
had the characters of a virus or free living genes.
Sub sequently number of genes united to form
‘proto viruses’ somewhat similar to present day
viruses. Two major cell types that appeared
during this time were significant. One form of the
earliest cell contained clumps of nucleoproteins
embedded in the cell substance. Such cells were
similar to the Monera. They are considered as
ancestral to the modern bacteria and blue green
algae. The other form of earliest cells contained
nucleoprotein clumps that condensed into a
central mass surrounded by a thin membrane.
This membrane separated nucleoproteins from
the cell substances. Such cells were referred
to as Protista. When the natural sources of
food in the ocean declined in course of time
the ancestors of Monera and Protista had to
evolve different methods for food procurement.
These may be summarized as parasitism,
saprophytism, predator or animalism and
chemosynthesis or photosynthesis. When the
number of photosynthetic organisms increased
there was an increase in the free O2 in the sea
and atmosphere.

CH<sup>4</sup>+2O<sup>2</sup> → CO<sup>2</sup> +2H<sup>2</sup>O
4NH<sup>3</sup>+3O<sup>2</sup> → 2N<sup>2</sup>+6H<sup>2</sup>O

The atmospheric oxygen combined with
methane and ammonia to form CO2 and free
nitrogen. The presence of the free O2 brought
about the evolution of aerobic respiration
which could yield large amounts of energy
by oxidation of food stuffs. Thus Prokaryotes
and Eukaryotes evolved.

## <u>Experimental approach to the origin of life </u>

**Urey and Miller (1953)**, paved way
for understanding the possible synthesis of
organic compounds that led to the appearance
of living organisms is depicted in the **Fig. 6.1.**
In their experiment, a mixture of gases was
allowed to circulate over electric discharge
from an tungsten electrode. A small flask was
kept boiling and the steam emanating from
it was made to mix with the mixture of gases
(ammonia, methane and hydrogen) in the large
chamber that was connected to the boiling
water. The steam condensed to form water


![](/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic38.png)

which ran down the ‘U’ tube. Experiment
was conducted continuously for a week and
the liquid was analysed. Glycine, alanine,
beta alanine and aspartic acid were identified.
Thus Miller’s experiments had an insight as to
the possibility of abiogenetic synthesis of large
amount of variety of organic compounds in
nature from a mixture of sample gases in which
the only source of carbon was methane. Later
in similar experiments, formation of all types of
amino acids, and nitrogen bases were noticed.

## <u> 6.4 Evidences for biological evolution </u>

#### <u>6.4.1 Paleontological evidences</u>

Paleontology is the study of prehistoric
life through fossils. Fossils are described as
the true witnesses of evolution or documents
of various geological strata of
evolution. Fossilization is the
process by which plant and
animal remains are preserved
in sedimentary rocks. They fall
under three main categories.


**i) Actual remains** – The
original hard parts such as bones,
teeth or shells are preserved as
such in the earth’s atmosphere.
This is the most common method
of fossilization. When marine
animals die, their hard parts such
as bones, shells, etc., are covered
with sediments and are protected
from further deterioration. They
get preserved as such as they
are preserved in vast ocean; the
salinity in them prevents decay.
The sediments become hardened
to form definite layers or strata.
For example, Woolly Mammoth
that lived 22 thousand years ago
were preserved in the frozen
coast of Siberia as such. Several
human beings and animals living
in the ancient city of Pompeii were
preserved intact by volcanic ash
which gushed out from Mount Vesuvius.

**ii) Petrifaction** – When animals die
the original portion of their body may be
replaced molecule for molecule by minerals
and the original substance being lost through
disintegration. This method of fossilization
is called petrifaction. The principle minerals
involved in this type fossilization are iron
pyrites, silica, calcium carbonate and
bicarbonates of calcium and magnesium.


**iii) Natural moulds and casts** – Even
after disintegration, the body of an animal
might leave indelible impression on the soft
mud which later becomes hardened into
stones. Such impressions are called moulds.
The cavities of the moulds may get filled up
by hard minerals and get fossilized, which are
called casts. Hardened faecal matter termed
as coprolites occur as tiny pellets. Analysis of
the coprolites enables us to understand the
nature of diet the pre-historic animals thrived
on.

### 6.4.2 Evidences from comparative anatomy

Similarities in structure between groups
of organisms are accepted as indicators of
relationship. For example, a comparative study
of the forelimbs of different vertebrates exhibits
a fundamental plan of similarity in structure.
These relationships can be studied under
homologous organs, analogous organs, vestigial
organs, connecting links and atavistic organs.

### Homologous structures

In vertebrates, comparative anatomical
studies reveal a basic plan in various
structures such as fore limbs and hind limbs.
Fore limbs of vertebrates exhibit anatomical
similarity with each other and is made of
similar bones such as humerus, radius, ulna,
carpals, metacarpals and phalanges.

![](/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic39.png)

Structures which are similar in origin
but perform different functions are called
homologous structures that brings about
**divergent evolution (Fig 6.2).**

Similarly the thorn of Bougainvillea and
the tendrils of Curcurbita and Pisum sativum
represent homology. The thorn in former is
used as a defence mechanism from grazing
animals and the tendrils of latter is used as a
support for climbing.

**Analogous structures**

Organs having different structural
patterns but similar function are termed as
analogous structures. For example, the wings
of birds and insects are different structurally
but perform the same function of flight that
brings about **convergent evolution (Fig. 6.3).**

![](/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic40.png)

Other examples of analogous organs
include the eyes of the Octopus and of
mammals and the flippers of Penguins
and Dolphins. Root modification in sweet
potato and stem modification in potato are
considered as analogous organs. Both of these
plants have a common function of storage of
food.


### <u>Vestigial organs </u>

Structures that are of no use to the
possessor, and are not necessary for their
existence are called vestigial organs. Vestigial
organs may be considered as remnants of
structures which were well developed and
functional in the ancestors, but disappeared
in course of evolution due to their non-
utilization. Human appendix is the remnant
of caecum which is functional in the digestive
tract of herbivorous animals like rabbit.
Cellulose digestion takes place in the caecum
of these animals. Due to change in the diet
containing less cellulose, caecum in human
became functionless and is reduced to a
vermiform appendix, which is vestigial. Other
examples of vestigial organs in human beings
include coccyx, wisdom teeth, ear muscles,
body hair, mammae in male, nictitating
membrane of the eye, etc.,


### <u> Connecting link </u>

The organisms which possess the
characters of two different groups (transitional
stage) are called connecting links. Example
Peripatus (connecting link between Annelida
and Arthropoda), Archeopteryx (connecting
link between Reptiles and Aves).

### <u> Atavistic organs </u>

Sudden appearance of vestigial organs in
highly evolved organisms is called atavistic
organs. Example, presence of tail in a human
baby is an atavistic organ.

### <u> 6.4.3 Embryological evidences </u>

Embryology deals with the study of the
development of individual from the egg to the
adult stage. A detailed study of the embryonic
development of different forms makes us to
think that there is a close resemblance during
development.
The development of heart in all vertebrates
follows the same pattern of development as a
pair of tubular structures
that later develop into
two chambered heart in
fishes, three chambered in
amphibians and in most
reptiles and four chambered
in crocodiles, birds and
mammals; indicating a
common ancestry for all the
vertebrates,
Hence scientists in the
19th century concluded that
higher animals during their
embryonic development
pass through stages of lower
animals (ancestors). **Ernst Von Haeckel**, propounded the “**biogenetic law"** or
**theory of recapitulation”** which states
that the life history of an individual
(ontogeny) briefly repeats or recapitulates the
evolutionary history of the race (phylogeny).
In other words **“Ontogeny recapitulates**
**Phylogeny”.** The embryonic stages of a
higher animal resemble the adult stage of its
ancestors. Appearance of pharyngeal gill slits,
yolk sac and the appearance of tail in human
embryos are some of the examples **(Fig. 6.4).**
The biogenetic law is not universal and it is
now thought that animals do not recapitulate
the adult stage of any ancestors. The human
embryo recapitulates the embryonic history
and not the adult history of the organisms.
The comparative study of the embryo of
different animals shows structural similarities
among themselves. The embryos of fish,
salamander, tortoise, chick and human start
life as a single cell, the zygote, and undergo
cleavage to produce the blastula, change to
gastrula and are triploblastic. This indicates
that all the above said animals have evolved
from a common ancestor.

## <u> Molecular evidences </u>

Molecular evolution is the process
of change in the sequence composition of
molecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins
across generations. It uses principles of
evolutionary biology and population genetics
to explain patterns in the changes of molecules.
One of the most useful advancement in the
development of molecular biology is proteins and
other molecules that control life processes are
conserved among species. A slight change that
occurs over time in these conserved molecules
(DNA, RNA and protein) are often called
molecular clocks. Molecules that have been used
to study evolution are cytochrome c (respiratory
pathway) and rRNA (protein synthesis).

## <u> 6.5 Theories of biological evolution </u>
### 6.5.1 Lamarck’s theory

**Jean Baptiste de Lamarck,** was the first to
postulate the theory of evolution in his famous
book **‘Philosophie Zoologique’** in the year
**1809**. The two principles of Lamarckian theory
are:

**i. The theory of use and disuse** - Organs
that are used often will increase in size and
those that are not used will degenerate. Neck in
giraffe is an example of use and absence of limbs
in snakes is an example for disuse theory.

**ii. The theory of inheritance of acquired characters** - Characters that are developed
during the life time of an organism are called
acquired characters and these are then inherited.

## The main objection to Lamarckism

Lamarck’s “Theory of Acquired characters”
was disproved by **August Weismann** who
conducted experiments on mice for twenty
generations by cutting their tails and breeding
them. All mice born were with tail. Weismann
proved his germplasm theory that change in the
somatoplasm will not be transferred to the next
generation but changes in the germplasm will
be inherited.

**Neo-Lamarckism**

The followers of Lamarck
(Neo-Lamarckists) like **Cope, Osborn, Packard and Spencer** tried to explain Lamarck’s theory
on a more scientific basis. They considered that
adaptations are universal. Organisms acquire
new structures due to their adaptations to
the changed environmental conditions. They
argued that external conditions stimulate the
somatic cells to produce certain ‘secretions’
which reach the sex cells through the blood and
bring about variations in the offspring.

## 6.5.2 Darwin’s theory of Natural Selection

**Charles Darwin** explained the theory of
evolution in his book **‘The Origin of Species by Natural Selection’**. During his journey around
the Earth, he made extensive observations of
plants and animals. He noted a huge variety
and remarkable similarities among organisms
and their adaptive features to cope up to their
environment. He proved that fittest organisms
can survive and leave more progenies than the
unfit ones through natural selection.

Darwin’s theory was based on several facts,
observations and influences. They are:

**1. Over production (or) prodigality of production**

All living organisms increase their
population in larger number. For example,
Salmon fish produces about 28 million eggs
during breeding season and if all of them hatch,
the seas would be filled with salmon in few
generations. Elephant, the slowest breeder that
can produce six young ones in its life time can
produce 6 million descendants at the end of 750
years in the absence of any check.

**2. Struggle for existence**

Organisms struggle for food, space and
mate. As these become a limiting factor,
competition exists among the members of
the population. Darwin denoted struggle for
existence in three ways –
Intra specific struggle between the same
species for food, space and mate.
Inter specific struggle with different species
for food and space.
Struggle with the environment to cope
with the climatic variations, flood, earthquakes,
drought, etc.,

**3. Universal occurrence of variations**

No two individuals are alike. There are
variations even in identical twins. Even the
children born of the same parents differ in colour,
height, behavior, etc., The useful variations
found in an organism help them to overcome
struggle and such variations are passed on to the
next generation.

**4. Origin of species by Natural Selection**

According to Darwin, nature is the most
powerful selective force. He compared origin
of species by natural selection to a small
isolated group. Darwin believed that the
struggle for existence resulted in the survival
of the fittest. Such organisms become better
adapted to the changed environment.

## Objections to Darwinism

Some objections raised against Darwinism
were –
*  Darwin failed to explain the mechanism
of variation.
*  Darwinism explains the survival of the
fittest but not the arrival of the fittest.
*  He focused on small fluctuating variations
that are mostly non-heritable.
*  He did not distinguish between somatic
and germinal variations.
* He could not explain the occurrence of
vestigial organs, over specialization of
some organs like large tusks in extinct
mammoths, oversized antlers in the
extinct Irish deer, etc.,

## Neo Darwinism

Neo Darwinism is the interpretation
of Darwinian evolution through Natural
Selection as it has been modified since it
was proposed. New facts and discoveries
about evolution have led to modifications
of Darwinism and is supported by **Wallace, Heinrich, Haeckel, Weismann and Mendel**.
This theory emphasizes the change in the
frequency of genes in population arises due
to mutation, variation, isolation and Natural selection.


### 6.5.3 Mutation theory

**Hugo de Vries** put forth the Mutation
theory. Mutations are sudden random changes
that occur in an organism that is not heritable. De
Vries carried out his experiments in the Evening
Primrose plant (Oenothera lamarckiana) and
observed variations in them due to mutation.

According to de Vries, sudden and large
variations were responsible for the origin of new
species whereas Lamarck and Darwin believed
in gradual accumulation of all variations as the
causative factors in the origin of new species.

Hugo de Vries believed that Mutations
are random and directionless, but Darwinian
variations are small and directional.

{{< box >}}

Hugo de Vries believed that speciation
are due to Mutation and called saltation
(single step large Mutation).

{{< /box >}}

## Salient features of Mutation Theory
* Mutations or discontinuous variation are
transmitted to other generations.
* In naturally breeding populations, mutations
occur from time to time.
* There are no intermediate forms, as they are
fully fledged.
* They are strictly subjected to natural
selection.

### 6.5.4 Modern synthetic theory

**Sewell Wright, Fisher, Mayer, Huxley, Dobzhansky, Simpson and Haeckel** explained
Natural Selection in the light of Post-Darwinian
discoveries. According to this theory gene
mutations, chromosomal mutations, genetic
recombinations, natural selection and
reproductive isolation are the five basic factors
involved in the process of organic evolution.

**i. Gene mutation** refers to the changes in the
structure of the gene. It is also called gene/
point mutation. It alters the phenotype of
an organism and produces variations in
their offspring.

**ii. Chromosomal mutation** refers to the
changes in the structure of chromosomes
due to deletion, addition, duplication,
inversion or translocation. This too
alters the phenotype of an organism and
produces variations in their offspring.

**iii. Genetic recombination** is due to crossing
over of genes during meiosis. This brings
about genetic variations in the individuals
of the same species and leads to heritable
variations.

**iv. Natural selection** does not produce any
genetic variations but once such variations
occur it favours some genetic changes
while rejecting others (driving force of
evolution).

**v. Reproductive isolation** helps in
preventing interbreeding between related
organisms.

## 6.5.5 Evolution by anthropogenic sources

### Natural Selection (Industrial melanism)

**Natural selection** can be explained
clearly through industrial melanism.
Industrial melanism is a classical case of
Natural selection exhibited by the peppered
moth, Biston betularia. These were available
in two colours, white and black. Before
industrialization peppered moth both
white and black coloured were common in
England. Pre-industrialization witnessed
white coloured background of the wall of
the buildings hence the white coloured
moths escaped from their predators. Post
industrialization, the tree trunks became
dark due to smoke and soot let out from the
industries. The black moths camouflaged on
the dark bark of the trees and the white moths
were easily identified by their predators.
Hence the dark coloured moth population
was selected and their number increased
when compared to the white moths. Nature
offered positive selection pressure to the
black coloured moths. The above proof shows
that in a population, organisms that can adapt
will survive and produce more progenies
resulting in increase in population through
natural selection.

**Artificial selection** is a byproduct of
human exploitation of forests, oceans and
fisheries or the use of pesticides, herbicides
or drugs. For hundreds of years humans have
selected various types of dogs, all of which are
variants of the single species of dog. If human
beings can produce new varieties in short
period, then **“nature”** with its vast resources
and long duration can easily produce new
species by selection.

## 6.5.6 Adaptive Radiation

The evolutionary process which
produces new species diverged from a single
ancestral form becomes adapted to newly
invaded habitats is called adaptive radiation.
Adaptive radiations are best exemplified in
closely related groups that have evolved in
relatively short time. Darwin’s finches and
Australian marsupials are best examples
for adaptive radiation. When more than
one adaptive radiation occurs in an isolated
geographical area, having the same structural
and functional similarity is referred to as
convergent evolution.

## Darwin’s finches

Their common ancestor arrived on the
Galapagos about 2 million years ago. During
that time, Darwin's finches have evolved into
14 recognized species differing in body size,
beak shape and feeding behavior. Changes in
the size and form of the beak have enabled
different species to utilize different food
resources such as insects, seeds, nectar from
cactus flowers and blood from iguanas, all
driven by Natural selection. **Fig. 6.5**represents
some of the finches observed by Darwin.
Genetic variation in the ALX1 gene in the
DNA of Darwin finches is associated with
variation in the beak shape. Mild mutation in
the ALX1 gene leads to phenotypic change in
the shape of the beak of the Darwin finches.

Marsupials in Australia and placental
mammals in North America are two
subclasses of mammals they have adapted
in similar way to a particular food resource,
locomotory skill or climate. They were
separated from the common ancestor more
than 100 million year ago and each lineage
continued to evolve independently. Despite
temporal and geographical separation,
marsupials in Australia and placental
mammals in North America have produced
varieties of species living in similar habitats
with similar ways of life. Their overall
resemblance in shape, locomotory mode,
feeding and foraging are superimposed
upon different modes of reproduction. This
feature reflects their distinctive evolutionary
relationships.

Over 200 species of marsupials live in
Australia along with many
fewer species of placental
mammals. The marsupials
have undergone adaptive
radiation to occupy
the diverse habitats in
Australia, just as the
placental mammals have
radiated across North
America.

## <u> 6.6 Mechanism of evolution </u>

Microevolution (evolution on a
small scale) refers to the changes in allele
frequencies within a population. Allele
frequencies in a population may change due to
four fundamental forces of evolution such as
natural selection, genetic drift, mutation and
gene flow.

### <u> 6.6.1 Natural selection </u>
It occurs when one allele (or combination
of alleles of differences) makes an organism
more or less fit to survive and reproduce
in a given environment. If an allele reduces
fitness, its frequencies tend to drop from one
generation to the next.

The evolutionary path of a given gene
i.e., how its allele's change in frequency in the
population across generation, may result from
several evolutionary mechanisms acting at
once. For example, one gene’s allele frequencies
might be modified by both gene flow and
genetic drift, for another gene, mutation
may produce a new allele, that is favoured by
natural selection **(Fig. 6.6).**

### Selection
There are mainly three types of natural
selection

**i. Stabilising Selection (centipetal selection):**
This type of selection operates in a stable
environment **(Fig. 6.7a).**The organisms
with average phenotypes survive whereas
the extreme individuals from both the ends
are eliminated. There is no speciation but the
phenotypic stability is maintained within the
population over generation. For example,
measurements of sparrows that survived
the storm clustered around the mean, and
the sparrows that failed to survive the
storm clustered around the extremes of the
variation showing stabilizing selection.


**ii. Directional Selection:** The environment
which undergoes gradual change is subjected
to directional selection **(Fig. 6.7b).** This type
of selection removes the individuals from
one end towards the other end of phenotypic
distribution. For example, size differences
between male and female sparrows. Both
male and female look alike externally
but differ in body weight. Females show
directional selection in relation to body
weight.

**iii. Disruptive Selection (centrifugal selection):**
When homogenous environment changes
into heterogenous environment this type
of selection is operational (Fig. 6.7c). The
organisms of both the extreme phenotypes
are selected whereas individuals with
average phenotype are eliminated. This
results in splitting of the population into


![](/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic42.png)

sub population/species. This is a rare form
of selection but leads to formation of two
or more different species. It is also called
adaptive radiation. E.g. Darwin's finches-
beak size in relation to seed size inhabiting
Galapagos islands.


Group selection and sexual selection are
other types of selection. The two major group
selections are Altrusim and Kin selection.

## <u> 6.6.2 Gene flow </u>

Movement of genes through gametes or
movement of individuals in (immigration) and
out (emigration) of a population is referred to as
gene flow. Organisms and gametes that enter the
population may have new alleles or may bring
in existing alleles but in different proportions
than those already in the population. Gene flow
can be a strong agent of evolution (Fig 6.8).

## <u>6.6.3 Genetic drift / Sewall Wright Effect</u>

Genetic drift is a mechanism of evolution in
which allele frequencies of a population change
over generation due to chance (sampling error).
Genetic drift occurs in all population sizes,
but its effects are strong in a small population
**(Fig. 6.9).** It may result in a loss of some
alleles (including beneficial ones) and fixation
of other alleles. Genetic drift can have major
effects, when the population is reduced in size
by natural disaster due to bottle neck effect or
when a small group of population splits from
the main population to form a new colony due
to founder’s effect.

### 6.6.4 Mutation

Although mutation is the original source
of all genetic variation, mutation rate for
most organisms is low. Hence new mutations
on an allele frequencies from one generation
to the next is usually not large.

### 6.7 Hardy - Weinberg Principle

In nature, populations are usually
evolving such as the grass in an open meadow,
wolves in a forest and bacteria in a person’s
body are all natural populations. All of these
populations are likely to be evolving some
of their genes. Evolution does not mean that
the population is moving towards perfection
rather the population is changing its genetic
makeup over generations. For example in a
wolf population, there may be a shift in the
frequency of a gene variant for black fur than
grey fur. Sometimes, this type of change is
due to natural selection or due to migration
or due to random events.

First we will see the set of conditions
required for a population not to evolve. Hardy
of UK and Weinberg of Germany stated that
the allele frequencies in a population are
stable and are constant from generation to
generation in the absence of gene flow, genetic
drift, mutation, recombination and natural
selection. If a population is in a state of Hardy
Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of
alleles and genotypes or sets of alleles in that
population will remain same over generations.
Evolution is a change in the allele frequencies
in a population over time. Hence population
in Hardy Weinberg is not evolving.

Suppose we have a large population of
beetles, (infinitely large) and appear in two
colours dark grey (black) and light grey, and
their colour is determined by ‘A’ gene. ‘AA’
and ‘Aa’ beetles are dark grey and ‘aa’ beetles
are light grey. In a population let’s say that ‘A’
allele has frequency (p) of 0.3 and ‘a’ allele has
a frequency (q ) of 0.7. Then p+q=1.

If a population is in Hardy Weinberg
equilibrium, the genotype frequency can
be estimated by Hardy Weinberg equation.
(p + q)<sup>2</sup> = p<sup>2</sup> + 2pq + q<sup>2</sup>

p<sup>2</sup> = frequency of AA 

2pq= frequency of Aa 

q<sup>2</sup> = frequency of aa

p = 0.3, q = 0.7 then, 

p<sup>2</sup> = (0.3)<sup>2</sup>= 0.09 = 9 % AA

2pq = 2(0.3) (0.7) = 0.42 = 42 % Aa

q<sup>2</sup> = (0.7)<sup>2</sup> 0.49 = 49 % aa

Hence the beetle population appears to
be in Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium. When
the beetles in Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium
reproduce, the allele and genotype frequency
in the next generation would be: Let’s assume
that the frequency of ‘A’ and ‘a’ allele in the
pool of gametes that make the next generation
would be the same, then there would be
no variation in the progeny. The genotype
frequencies of the parent appears in the next
generation. (i.e. 9% AA, 42% Aa and 49% aa).


If we assume that the beetles mate
randomly (selection of male gamete and
female gamete in the pool of gametes), the
probability of getting the offspring genotype
depends on the genotype of the combining
parental gametes.

## Hardy Weinberg’s assumptions include

**No mutation** – No new alleles are generated
by mutation nor the genes get duplicated or
deleted.

**Random mating** – Every organism gets a
chance to mate and the mating is random
with each other with no preferences for a
particular genotype.

**No gene flow** - Neither individuals nor
their gametes enter (immigration) or exit
(emigration) the population.

**Very large population size** - The population
should be infinite in size.

**No natural selection-** All alleles are fit to
survive and reproduce.

If any one of these assumptions were not
met, the population will not be in Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium. Only if the allele
frequencies changes from one generation to
the other, evolution will take place.


## 6.8 Origin and Evolution of Man

Mammals evolved in the
early Jurassic period, about
210 million years ago (mya).
Hominid evolution occurred
in Asia and Africa. Hominids
proved that human beings
are superior to other animals and efficient in
making tools and culture.

The earliest fossils of the prehistoric man
like Ramapithecus and Sivapithecus lived
some 14 mya and were derived from ape like
*Dryopithecus*. Dryopithecus and *Ramapithecus*
were hairy and walked like gorillas and
chimpanzees. Ramapithecus is regarded as
a possible ancester of *Australopithecus* and
therefore of modern humans. They were
vegetarians **(Fig 6.10).**

*Australopithecus* lived in East African
grasslands about 5 mya and was called the
Australian ape man. He was about 1.5 meters
tall with bipedal locomotion, omnivorous,
semi erect, and lived in caves. Low forehead,
brow ridges over the eyes, protruding face,
lack of chin, low brain capacity of about 350 –
450 cc, human like dentition, lumbar curve in
the vertebral column were his distinguishing
features.

Homo habilis lived about 2 mya. Their
brain capacity was between 650 – 800cc, and
was probably vegetarian. They had bipedal
locomotion and used tools made of chipped
stones.

Homo erectus the first human like being was
around 1.7 mya and was much closer to human
in looks, skull was flatter and thicker than the
modern man and had a large brain capacity of
around 900 cc. Homo erectus probably ate meat
Homo ergaster and Homo erectus were the first
to leave Africa.

Neanderthal human was found in Neander
Valley, Germany with a brain size of 1400 cc
and lived between 34,000 - 1,00,000 years
ago. They differ from the modern human in
having semierect posture, flat cranium, sloping
forehead, thin large orbits, heavy brow ridges,
protruding jaws and no chin. They used animal
hides to protect their bodies, knew the use of

![](/books/12-biology/zoology1/pic45.png)

fire and buried their dead. They did not practice
agriculture and animal domestication.
Cro-Magnon was one of the most talked
forms of modern human found from the rocks
of Cro-Magnon, France and is considered as
the ancestor of modern Europeans. They were
not only adapted to various environmental
conditions, but were also known for their cave
paintings, figures on floors and walls.
Homo sapiens or modern human arose
in Africa some 25,000 years ago and moved
to other continents and developed into
distinct races. They had a brain capacity of
1300 – 1600 cc. They started cultivating crops
and domesticating animals.

## Summary

Evolutionary Biology is the study of history
of life forms on Earth which originated on Earth
millions of years ago. How Earth originated, how
life originated, what is the place of man in the
universe are all general questions. This chapter
deals with several theories to explain the life
on Earth. Evidence from the fossil record and
many other areas of biology like embryology,
anatomy and molecular biology indicates a
common ancestry.

The theories advanced by Lamarck,
Darwin, Hugo de Vries explained the intricate
evolutionary process. Geological time scale
with different eras, periods and epochs gives
an idea about the dominant species in those
days. The mathematical distribution of gene
and genotype frequencies remains constant in
a small population was contributed by Hardy
and Weinberg in 1608. Natural Selection and
gene pool are the important factors those affect
Hardy Weinberg equilibrium.

Human evolution states that humans
developed from primates or ape like ancestors.
The emergence of Homo sapiens as a distinct
species from apes and placental mammals in
brain size, eating habit and other behavior
proves that ‘Ontogeny recapitulates Phylogeny’.
