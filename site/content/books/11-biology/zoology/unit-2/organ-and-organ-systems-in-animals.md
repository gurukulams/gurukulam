### Introduction
From microbes to the blue whale,
organisms occur in different sizes and
shapes with a well organized organ
and organ systems. The basic tissues
(chapter-3) organize to form an organ
which in turn associates to form organ
systems in multicellular organisms. Such
an organization is essential for efficient
and better coordinated activities of
millions of cells constituting an organism.
You are being introduced to understand
the morphology and anatomy of three
organisms placed at different evolutionary
levels to show their organization and
functions. Morphology refers to the study
of form or externally visible features.
The word anatomy is used for the study
of internal organs in the animals. This
chapter deals with the morphology and
anatomy of invertebrates represented by
the earthworm and cockroach and the
vertebrates represented by the frog.

#### 4.1 Earthworm - Lampito mauritii
{{< box title="classification" type="objective" >}}
               Phylum : Annelida
               Class : Oligochaeta
               Order : Haplotaxida
               Genus : Lampito
               Species : mauritii
{{< /box >}}


Earthworm is a terrestrial invertebrate that
inhabits the upper layers of the moist soil, rich
in decaying organic matter. It is nocturnal
and during the day it lives in burrows made
by burrowing and swallowing the soil. In
gardens, they can be traced by their faecal
deposits known as worm castings on the
soil surface. Earthworms are considered
as “**Friends of Farmers**”. The common
Indian earthworms are Lampito mauritii
(Syn. Megascolex mauritii), Perioynx
excavatus and Metaphire posthuma (Syn.
Pheretima posthuma). Earthworms are
also conveniently classified based on their
ecological strategies as **epigeics** **anecics**
and **endogeics**  (Figure 4.1). Epigeics (Greek
for “up on the earth”) are surface dwellers,
eg. Perionyx excavatus and Eudrilus
eugeniae. Anecics (Greek for “outer layer
of the earth”) are found in upper layers of
the soil, eg. Lampito mauritii, Lumbricus
terrestris. Endogeics (Greek for “within the
earth”) are found in deeper layers of the soil
eg. Octochaetona thurstoni.

##### **Morphology**

Lampito mauritii is commonly found in Tamil
Nadu. It has a long and cylindrical narrow
body which is bilaterally symmetrical. L.
mauritii is 80 to 210 mm in length with a
diameter of 3.5 – 5 mm, and is light brown
in colour, with purplish tinge at the anterior
end. This colour of the earthworm is mainly
due to the presence of porphyrin pigment.
The body of the earthworm is encircled by a
large number of grooves which divides it into
a number of compartments called **segments**
or **metameres** (Figure 4.2). L. mauritii
consists of about 165 – 190 segments. The
dorsal surface of the body is marked by a
dark mid dorsal line (dorsal blood vessel)
along the longitudinal axis of the body.
The ventral surface is distinguished by the
presence of genital openings. The mouth is
found in the centre of the first segment of the
body, called the **peristomium**. Overhanging
the mouth is a small flap called the upper lip
or **prostomium**. The last segment has the
anus called the **pygidium**. In mature worms,
segments 14 to 17 may be found swollen with
a glandular thickening of the skin called the
clitellum. This helps in the formation of the
cocoon. Due to the presence of **clitellum**,
the body of an earthworm is divided into
pre clitellar region (1st – 13th segments),
clitellar region (14th – 17th segments) and
the post – clitellar region (after the 17th
segment). In all the segments of the body
except the first, last and clitellum, there is
a ring of chitinous body setae. This body
setae arises from a setigerous sac of the skin
and it is curved as **S** – shaped. Setae can be
protruded or retracted and their principal
role is in locomotion.
The external apertures are the mouth,
anus, dorsal pores, spermathecal openings,
genital openings and nephridiopores. The
dorsal pores are present from the 10th segment
onwards. The coelomic fluid communicates
to the exterior through these pores and keeps
the body surface moist and free from harmful
microorganisms. Spermathecal openings are
three pairs of small ventrolateral apertures

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ/pic2.png)

lying intersegmentally between the grooves
of the segments 6/7, 7/8 and 8/9. A pair of
female genital apertures lie on the ventral side
in the 14th segment and a pair of male genital
apertures are situated latero-ventrally in the
18th segment. Nephridiopores are numerous
and found throughout the body of the
earthworm except a few anterior segments,
through which the metabolic wastes are
eliminated.

**Table 4.1**: **Morphological** **and anatomical** **differences between Lampito mauritii and Metaphire posthuma**



##### Anatomy
The body wall of the earthworm is very
moist, thin, soft, skinny, elastic and
consists of the cuticle, epidermis, muscles
and coelomic epithelium. The epidermis
consists of supporting cells, gland cells, basal
cells and sensory cells. A spacious body
cavity called the **coelom** is seen between
the alimentary canal and the body wall.
The coelom contains the coelomic fluid
and serves as a **hydrostatic skeleton**, in
which the coelomocytes are known to play
a major role in regeneration, immunity
and wound healing. The coelomic fluid
of the earthworm is milky and alkaline,
which consists of granulocytes or eleocytes,
amoebocytes, mucocytes and leucocytes.

##### Digestive system

The digestive system of the earthworm
consists of the alimentary canal and the
digestive glands. The alimentary canal
runs as a straight tube throughout the
length of the body from the mouth to anus
(Figure 4. 3).
The **mouth** opens into the **buccal cavity**
which occupies the 1st and 2nd segments.
The buccal cavity leads into a thick
**muscular pharynx**, which occupies the 3rd
and 4th segments and is surrounded by the
**pharyngeal glands**. A small narrow tube,
oesophagus lies in the 5th segment and
continues into a muscular **gizzard** in the 6th
segment. The gizzard helps in the grinding
of soil particles and decaying leaves.
Intestine starts from the 7th segment and
continues till the last segment. The dorsal
wall of the **intestine** is folded into the cavity
as the **typhlosole**. This fold contains blood
vessels and increases the absorptive area of
the intestine. The inner epithelium consists

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ/pic3.png)

of columnar cells and glandular cells. The
alimentary canal opens to the exterior
through the anus.
The ingested organic rich soil passes
through the digestive tract where
digestive enzymes breakdown complex
food into smaller absorbable units. The
simpler molecules are absorbed through
the intestinal membrane and are utilized.
The undigested particles along with earth
are passed out through the anus, as **wormcastings** or **vermicasts**. The pharyngeal

##### Intestinal Caeca
In Metaphire posthuma, the 26th segment
has a pair of short conical out growths
called intestinal caecae. It is extended
anteriorly up to the 22nd segment. These
are digestive glands and secrete an
amylolytic enzyme for the digestion of
starch. Intestinal caecae are not present
in many species of earthworms such as
the Lampito mauritii.

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ/pic4.png)

or salivary gland cells and the glandular
cells of the intestine are supposed to be the
digestive glands which secrete digestive
enzymes for digestion of food.

##### Respiratory System
The earthworm has no special respiratory
organs like lungs or gills. Respiration takes
place through the body wall. The outer
surface of the skin is richly supplied with
blood capillaries which aid in the diffusion
of gases. Oxygen diffuses through the skin
into the blood while carbon dioxide from
the blood diffuses out. The skin is kept
moist by mucous and coelomic fluid and
facilitates exchange of gases.

##### Circulatory system

Lampito mauritii exhibits a closed type
of blood vascular system consisting of
blood vessels, capillaries and lateral hearts
(Figure 4.4). Two median longitudinal
vessels run above and below the alimentary
canal as dorsal and ventral vessels of
the earthworm. There are paired valves
in the dorsal vessels which prevent the
backward flow of the blood. The ventral
vessel has no valves and is non contractile,
allowing the backward flow of blood. In
the anterior part of the body the dorsal
vessel is connected with the ventral vessel
by eight pairs of **commissural vessels** or
the **lateral hearts** lying in the 6th to 13th
segments. These vessels run on either
side of the alimentary canal and pump
blood from the dorsal vessel to the ventral
vessel. The dorsal vessel receives blood
from various organs in the body. The
ventral vessel supplies blood to the various
organs. Blood glands are present in the
anterior segments of the earthworm. They
produce blood cells and haemoglobin
which is dissolved in the plasma and gives
red colour to the blood.


![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ/pic5.png)

##### Nervous System
The bilobed mass of nervous tissue
called supra - pharyngeal ganglia, lies on
the dorsal wall of the pharynx in the 3rd
segment, is referred as the “brain”. The
ganglion found below the pharynx in the
4th segment is called the sub-pharyngeal
ganglion (Figure. 4.4). The brain and the
sub - pharyngeal ganglia
are connected by a pair
of circum-pharyngeal
connectives. They run one
on each side of the pharynx.
Thus a nerve ring is formed
around the anterior region
of the alimentary canal. The
double ventral nerve cord
runs backward from the
sub - pharyngeal ganglion.
The brain along with
other nerves in the ring
integrates sensory inputs
and command muscular
responses of the body.
The earthworm’s
receptors are stimulated
by a group of slender 
columnar cells connected with nerves.
The **Photoreceptors** (sense of light) are
found on the dorsal surface of the body.
**Gustatory** (sense of taste) and **olfactory
receptors** (sense of smell) are found
in the buccal cavity. **Tactile receptors**
(sense of touch), **chemoreceptors** (detect
chemical changes) and **thermoreceptors**
(changes in temperature) are present in
the prostomium and the body wall.

{{ < How do the earthworm’s sense activity
in their habitat without eyes, ears or a
nose? /> }}

##### Excretory System

Excretion is the process of elimination of
metabolic waste products from the body.
In earthworm, excretion is effected by
segmentally arranged, minute coiled, paired
tubules called nephridia. There are three

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ/pic6.png)

types of nephridia; (i) **pharyngeal or**
**tufted nephridia**  – present as paired
tufts in the 5th - 9th segments (ii)
**Micronephridia** or **Integumentary**
**nephridia**  – attached to the lining of
the body wall from the14th segment
to the last which open on the body
surface (iii) **Meganephridia** or
**septal nephridia** – present as pair
on both sides of intersegmental septa
of the 19th segment to the last and
open into intestine (Figure 4.5). The
meganephridium has an internal
funnel like opening called the
nephrostome, which is fully ciliated.
The nephrostome is in the preceding
segment and the rest of the tube is in
the succeeding segment. This tube
consists of three distinct divisions,
the ciliated, the glandular and the
muscular region. The waste material
collected through the ciliated funnel is
pushed into the muscular part of nephridium
by the ciliated region. The glandular part
extracts the waste from the blood and finally
the wastes exit out through the nephridiopore.
Besides nephridia, special cells on
the coelomic wall of the intestine, called
chloragogen cells are present. They extract
the nitrogenous waste from the blood of the
intestinal wall, into the body cavity to be
sent out through the nephridia.

##### Reproductive System
Earthworms are hermaphrodites or
monoecious i.e. male and female reproductive
organs are found in the same individual
(Figure 4. 6). Self fertilization is avoided
because two sex organs mature at different
times, which means the sperm develops earlier
than the production of ova (**Protandrous**).
Thus cross fertilization takes place.

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ/pic7.png)

In the male reproductive system, two
pairs of testes are present in the 10th and 11th
segments. The testes give rise to the **germ**
**cells or spermatogonia**, which develops
into spermatozoa in the two pairs of seminal
vesicles. Two pairs of seminal funnels called
**ciliary rosettes** are situated in the same
segments as the testes. The ciliated funnels
of the same side are connected to a long tube
called **vas deferens**. The **vasa deferentia**
run upto the 18th segment where they open
to the exterior through the **male genital**
**aperture**. The male genital aperture contains
two pairs of **penial setae** for copulation. A
pair of prostate glands lies in the 18th – 19th
segments. The secretion of the prostate
gland serves to cement the spermatozoa into
bundles known as **spermatophores**.

The female
r e p r o d u c t i v e
system consists of
a pair of ovaries
lying in the 13th
segment. Each
ovary has finger
like projections
which contain ova
in linear series.
Ovarian funnels
are present beneath
the **ovaries** which
continue into the
**oviducts**. They
open as a pair of
genital apertures
on the ventral side of the 14th segment.
Spermathecae or seminal receptacles
are three pairs lying in segments 7th,
8th and 9th, opening to the exterior on
the ventral side between 6th & 7th, 7th &
8th and 8th & 9th segments. They receive
spermatozoa from the partner and store
during copulation.

**Regeneration**
Earthworms have most of their
important organ in the first
20 segments. If earthworm gets cut after
the 20th segment, the anterior half can
regenerate, while the posterior half shall
disintegrate after some time.

A mutual exchange of sperms occurs
between two worms during mating. One
worm has to find another worm and
they mate juxtaposing opposite gonadal
openings, exchanging the sperms.
Mature egg cells in the nutritive fluid
are deposited in the cocoons produced

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ and organ systems in animals/pic8.png)
by the gland cells of the clitellum which
also collects the partner’s sperms from
the spermthecae. Fertilization and
development occurs within the cocoons,
which are deposited in the soil. After
about 2 – 3 weeks, each cocoon produces
baby earthworms. Development is
direct and no larva is formed during development.

**Life cycle**

Lampito mauritii begins its life cycle, from
the fertilized eggs. The eggs are held in a
protective cocoon. These cocoons have
an incubation period of about 14- 18 days
after which they hatch to release **juveniles**
(Figure 4.7). The juveniles undergo changes
into **non-clitellate** forms in phase – I after
about 15 days, which then develops a
**clitellum**, called the **clitellate** at the end of
the growth phase – II taking 15 - 17 days
to complete. During the reproductive stage,
earthworms copulate, and later shed their
cocoons in the soil after about 10 days. The
life cycle of Lampito mauritii takes about 60
days to complete.

|__________________________________|

Cockroach is a typical cosmopolitan
insect and exhibits all the fundamental
characteristics of Class Insecta. Generally
cockroaches are reddish brown or black
bodied with a light brown margin in the
first thoracic segment. They are omnivores,
nocturnal, living in damp and warm places
and are quite common in kitchens, hotels,
bakeries, restaurants, warehouse, sewage
and public places. Periplaneta is a cursorial
(swift runner) animal. It is dioecious and
oviparous and exhibits parental care. They
carry with them harmful germs of various
bacterial diseases like cholera, diarrhoea,
tuberculosis, and typhoid and hence are
known as **“Vectors”**.

### Morphology
The adult cockroaches are about 2 to 4
cm in length and about 1cm in width.
The body of the cockroach is compressed
dorso-ventrally, bilaterally symmetrical,
segmented and is divisible into three
distinct regions – head, thorax and
abdomen. The entire body is covered
by a hard, brown coloured, chitinous
exoskeleton. In each segment, exoskeleton
has hardened plates called sclerites, which
are joined together by a delicate and
elastic articular **membrane** or arthrodialmembrane. The sclerites of the dorsal
side are called **tergites**, those on the
ventral side are called **sternites** and those
of lateral sides are called **pleurites**.
The head of cockroach is small,
triangular lies at right angle to the
longitudinal body **axis**. the mouth parts are
directed downwards so it is **hypognathous**.
It is formed by the fusion of six segments
and shows great mobility in all directions
due to a flexible neck (Figure 4.8). The
head capsule bears a pair of large, sessile,
and reniform compound eyes, a pair of

{{< box title="classification" type="objective" >}}
The cockroaches are ancient and most
basic among all groups of insects,
dating back to the carboniferous
period, about 320 million years ago.

(a) External features (b) Head dorsal and
ventral view (c) Male and Female ventral
view of posterior segment of abdomen
antennae and appendages around the
mouth. Antennae have sensory receptors
that help in monitoring the environment.
The appendages form the mouth parts
which are of biting and chewing type
(**Mandibulate or Orthopterus type**).

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ/pic9.png)

The mouth parts consist of a **labrum**
(upper lip), a pair of **mandibles**, a pair
of **maxillae**, a labium (lower lip) and
a hypopharynx (tongue) or **lingua**
(Figure 4.9).
The thorax consists of three segments –
**Prothorax, Mesothorax and Metathorax**.
The prothoracic segment is the largest. The
head is connected with thorax by a short
extension of the prothorax called as the **neck**
or **cervicum**. Each thoracic segment bears a
pair of walking legs. Due to the presence of
three pairs of walking legs it is also called
**hexapoda** (hexa-six, poda-feet) All the
three pairs of walking legs are similar and
each leg consists of five segments – **coxa**
(large), **trochanter** (small), **femur** (long and
broad), **tibia** (long and thick) and **tarsus**.
The last segment of the leg - tarsus has five
movable joints or **podomeres or tarsomeres**.
Cockroach has two pairs of wings, the first
pair arises from mesothorax and protects the
hind wings when at rest, and is called **elytra**or **tegmina**. The second
pair of wings arises from the
metathorax and are used in
flight. The abdomen in both
male and female consists of
10 segments. Each segment
is covered by the dorsal
tergum, the ventral sternum
and between them a narrow
membranous pleuron on
each side. In females, the 7th
sternum is boat shaped and together with the
8th and 9th sterna forms a **brood or genital**
**pouch** whose anterior parts contains female
gonopore, spermathecal pores, collaterial
glands and posterior parts constitutes the
oothecal chamber in which the cocoons
are formed. In males, the genital pouch
lies at the hind end of the abdomen bound
dorsally by 9th and 10th terga and ventrally by
the 9th sternum. It contains the dorsal anus
and ventral male genital pore. In both the
sexes, genital apertures are surrounded by
sclerites called **gonapophysis**. Male bears a
pair of short and slender **anal styles** in the
9th sternum which are absent in the female.
In both sexes, the 10th segment bears a pair
of jointed filamentous structures called **anal**
**cerci** and bears a sense organ that is receptive
to vibrations in air and land. The 7th sternum
of male has a pair of large and oval apical
lobes or gynovalvular plates which form a
keel like structure which distinguishes the
male from the female.

One of the fastest
moving land insects is
the cockroach. They
can move as fast as
5.4 Km per hour.

#### Anatomy
##### Digestive system
The digestive system of cockroach consists of
the alimentary canal and digestive glands. The
alimentary canal is present in the body cavity
and is divided into three regions: foregut,
midgut and hindgut (Figure 4.10). The foregut
includes pre-oral cavity, mouth, pharynx and
oesophagus. This in turn opens into a sac
like structure called the crop which is used
for storing food. The **crop** is followed by the
**gizzard or proventriculus** which has an outer
layer of thick circular muscles and thick inner
cuticle forming six highly chitinous plates
called **“teeth”**. Gizzard helps in the grinding
of the food particles. The midgut is a short
and narrow tube behind the gizzard and is
glandular in nature. At the junctional region of
the gizzard are eight fingers like tubular blind
processes called the **hepatic caecae or enteric**
**caecae**. The hindgut is marked by the presence
of 100 – 150 yellow coloured thin filamentous
**malpighian** tubules which are helpful in
removal of the excretory products from the
haemolymph. The hindgut is broader than the
midgut and is differentiated into ileum, colon,
and rectum. The rectum opens out through
the anus.Digestive glands
of cockroach consist
of the salivary glands,
the glandular cells and
hepatic caecae. A pair of
salivary glands is found
on either side of the
crop in the thorax. The glandular cells of
the midgut and hepatic or gastric caecae
produce digestive juices.

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ/pic10.png)

Respiratory system
The respiratory system of cockroach
is well developed compared with other
terrestrial insects (Figure 4.11). Branched
tubes known as **trachea** open through 10
pairs of small holes called **spiracles** or
**stigmata**, present on the lateral side of the
body. Terminal branches of tracheal tubes
are called **tracheoles** which carry oxygen
to the entire body. The spiracles open and
close by valves regulated by **sphincter**
or **spiracular muscles**. Each tracheole is
filled with a watery fluid through which
exchange of gases takes place. During
high muscular activity, a part of the fluid
is drawn into the tissues to enable more
oxygen intake and rapid diffusion. The
passage of air in the tracheal system is:

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ/pic11.png)

{{< box title= "" >}}

Respiratory system of cockroach is formed
of spiracles and tracheal interconnections.
Why is it said to be more efficient than
that of earthworm? Why inspiration of
cockroach is said to be a passive process
while it is an active process in man?
{{< /box >}} 

##### Circulatory system

Periplaneta has an open type of
circulatory system (Figure 4.12) Blood
vessels are poorly developed and opens
into the haemocoel in which the blood or
haemolymph flows freely. Visceral organs
located in the haemocoel are bathed in
blood. The haemolymph is colourless and
consists of plasma and haemocytes which
are ‘phagocytic’ in nature. Heart is an
elongated tube with muscular wall lying
mid dorsally beneath the thorax. The
heart consists of 13 chambers with ostia
on either side. The blood from the sinuses
enters the heart through the **ostia** and is
pumped anteriorly to sinuses again. The
triangular muscles that are responsible
for blood circulation in the cockroach are
called **alary muscles** (13 pairs). One pair
of these muscles is found in each segment
on either side of the heart. In cockroach,
there is an accessory **pulsatile vesicle**
at the base of each antenna which also
pumps blood.

{{< box title ="Cockroaches survive without a head" >}}
A cockroach can live for about a week
without its head. Due to their open
circulatory system, and the fact that
they breathe through little holes on each
of their body segments, since they are
not dependent on the mouth or head to
breathe. The cockroach dies later due to
starvation
{{< /box >}}

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ/pic12.png)

{{< box title= "Do you Know" >}}
A cockroach can hold
its breath for 45 minutes,
and can even survive
being submerged under
water for half an hour. They hold their
breath often to help regulate loss of
water.
{{< /box >}}

##### Nervous system
The nervous system of cockroach consists
of a **nerve ring** and a **ganglionated**
**double ventral nerve cord, sub-oesophageal ganglion, circum–**
**oesophageal connectives and double ventral nerve cord (Figure 4.13)**.
The nerve ring is present around the oesophagus in the head capsule and is
formed by the supra-oesophagial ganglion called the ‘brain’, The brain is mainly a
sensory and an endocrine centre and lies
above the oesophagus. Sub-oesophageal
ganglion is the motor centre that controls
the movements of the mouth parts, legs
and wings. It lies below the oesophagus
and formed by the fusion of the paired
gangalia of mandibular, maxillary and
labial segments of the head. A pair of
circum–oesophageal connectives is present
around the oesophagus, connecting the

supra-oesophageal ganglia with the sub-
oesophageal ganglion. The double ventral

nerve cord is solid, ganglionated and arises
from the sub-oesophageal ganglion and
extends up to the 7th abdominal segment.
Three thoracic ganglia are present, one in
each thoracic segment and six abdominal
ganglia in the abdomen.
In cockroach, the sense organs are
antennae, compound eyes, labrum,
maxillary palps, labial palps and anal cerci.
The receptor for touch (thigmo receptors)
is located in the antenna, maxillary palps
and cerci. The receptor for smell (olfactory
receptors) is found on the antennae. The
receptor for taste (gustatory receptors) is
found on the palps of maxilla and labium.

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ/pic13.png)

Thermoreceptors are found on the first four
tarsal segments on the legs. The receptor
chordotonal is found on the anal cerci which
respond to air or earth borne vibrations.
The photoreceptors of the cockroach
consists of a pair of compound eyes at
the dorsal surface of the head. Each eye is
formed of about 2000 simple eyes called
the **ommatidia** (singular: ommatidium),
through which the cockroach can receive
several images of an object. This kind of
vision is known as mosaic vision with more
sensitivity but less resolution.

{{< box >}}
Arthropod eyes are called compound eyes
because they are made up of repeating
units, the ommatidia, each of which
functions as a separate visual receptor.
What is the difference between compound
eyes and simple eyes?
Why is mosaic vision with less resolution
seen in cockroaches?
{{< /box >}}

##### Excretory system
The Malpighian tubules are the main
excretory organs of cockroach which help
in eliminating the nitrogenous wastes from
the body in the form of uric acid. Cockroach
excretes uric acid, so it is **uricotelic**. In
addition, fat body, nephrocytes, cuticle, and
urecose glands are also excretory in function.
The malpighian tubules are thin, long,
filamentous, yellow coloured structures
attached at the junction of midgut and
hindgut. These are about 100-150 in number
and are present in 6-9 bundles. Each tubule is
lined by glandular and ciliated cells and the
waste is excreted out through the hindgut.
The glandular cells of the malpighian
tubules absorb water, salts, and nitrogenous
wastes from the haemolymph and transfer
them into the lumen of the tubules. The cells
of the tubules reabsorb water and certain
inorganic salts. By the contraction of the
tubules nitrogenous waste is pushed into the
ileum, where more water is reabsorbed. It
moves into the rectum and almost solid uric
acid is excreted along with the faecal matter.

Marcello Malpighi –
described these tubules
and called them vasa
varicose. Meckel later
called them Malpighian tubules.

#### Reproductive system
Cockroach is dioecious or unisexual. They
have well developed reproductive organs.
The male reproductive system consists
of a **pair of testes, vasa deferentia, an**
**ejaculatory duct, utricular gland, phallic**
**gland and the external genitalia**. A pair of
three lobed testes lies on the lateral side of
the 4th and 6th abdominal segments. From
each testis arises a thin vas deferens, which
opens into the ejaculatory duct through the
seminal vesicles. The ejaculatory duct is
an elongated duct which opens out by the
male gonopore lying ventral to the anus. A
**utricular or mushroom shaped gland** is a
large accessory reproductive gland, which
opens into the anterior part of the ejaculatory
duct. The seminal vesicles are present on
the ventral surface of the ejaculatory duct.
These sacs store the sperms in the form of
bundles called **spermatophores**. The duct of
**phallic or conglobate gland** also opens near
the gonopore, whose function is uncertain.
Surrounding the male genital opening are
few chitinous and asymmetrical structures
called **phallomeres or gonapophyses** which
help in copulation.

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ/pic14.png)

The female reproductive system of
cockroach consists of a **pair of ovaries**,
**vagina, genital pouch, collaterial glands**,
**spermathecae** and the external genitalia. A
pair of ovaries lies laterally in the 2nd and 6th
abdominal segment. Each ovary is formed of
a group of eight ovarian tubules or ovarioles,
containing a chain of developing ova. The
lateral oviducts of each ovary unite into a
broad median common oviduct known as
vagina, which opens into the genital chamber.
The vertical opening of the vagina is the
female genital pore. A pair of spermathecae
is present in the 6th segment, which opens
by a median aperture in the dorsal wall of
the genital pouch. During copulation, the
ova descend to the genital chamber, where
they are fertilized by the sperms. A pair
of white and branched **collaterial glands**
present behind the ovaries forms a
hard egg case called **Ootheca** around
the eggs. Genital pouch is formed by
the 7th, 8th and 9th abdominal sterna.
The genital pouch has two chambers, a
genital chamber into which the vagina
opens and an oothecal chamber where
oothecae are formed. Three pairs of
plate like chitinous structures called
gonapophyses are present around
the female genital aperture. These
gonapophyses guide the ova into the
ootheca as ovipositors. (Figure 4. 14).
Ootheca is a dark reddish to
blackish brown capsule about 12mm
long which contains nearly 16
fertilized eggs and dropped or glued to
a suitable surface, usually in crack or
crevice of high relative humidity near
a food source. On an average, each
female cockroach produces nearly 15
– 40 oothecae in its life span of about
one to two years. The embryonic
development occurs in the ootheca, which
takes nearly 5 – 13 weeks. The development
of cockroach is gradual through **nymphal**
**stages (paurometabolus)**. The nymph
resembles the adult and undergoes
moulting. The nymph grows by moulting
or ecdysis about 13 times to reach the adult
form.
Many species of cockroaches are wild.
About 30 cockroach species out of 4,600
are associated with human habitats. About
four species are well known as pests.
They destroy food and contaminate with
their offensive odour. The mere presence
of cockroaches is a sign of unhygienic
condition and they are also known to be
carriers of a number of bacterial diseases.
The cockroach allergen can cause asthma
to sensitive people.

Diploptera punctata, a
viviparous cockroach,
produces a nutritionally
dense crystalline "milk"
to feed their live-born young. It
is found in Myanmar, China, Fiji,
Hawaii, and India. Scientists think

## 4.3 Frog - Rana hexadactyla
About 360 million years ago, amphibians
were the first vertebrates to live on land.
Amphibians are diverse, widespread, and
abundant group since the early diversification.
There are about 4,500 species of amphibians.
Frog is an amphibian and hence placed in the
class Amphibia [Greek. Amphi - Both, bios –
life]. The largest order, with more than 3,900species, is Anura, which includes the frogs
and toads. Rana hexadactyla is placed in the
order Anura. Frogs live in fresh water ponds,
streams and in moist places. They feed on
small animals like insects, worms, small fishes,
slugs, snails, etc. During its early development
a frog is fully aquatic and breathes like a fish
with gills. It is poikilothermic, i.e., their
body temperature varies with the varying
environmental temperature.

##### Morphology of Frog

The body of a frog is **streamlined** to
help in swimming. It is dorso-ventrally
flattened and is divisible into head and
trunk. Body is covered by a smooth, slimy
skin loosely attached to the body wall.
The skin is dark green on the dorsal side
and pale ventrally. The head is almost
triangular in shape and has an apex
which forms the snout. The mouth is at
the anterior end and can open widely.

{{< box title="Do you Know" >}}
#### **Order - Anura (Frogs and Toads)**
Frogs and toads have
bodies specially designed
for jumping with greatly elongated hind
limbs. Frogs can live in water (aquatic), on
land (terrestrial), or on trees (arboreal).
Parental care is seen in few species.
{{< /box >}}


External nostrils are present on the
dorsal surface of the snout, one on each
side of the median line (Figure 4.15).
Eyes are large and project above the
general surface of the body. They lie
behind the external nostrils and are
protected by a thin movable lower eyelid,
thick immovable upper eyelid and a third
transparent eyelid called **nictitating**
**membrane**. This membrane protects the
eye when the frog is under water. A pair
of **tympanic membranes** forms the ear
drum behind the eyes on either side. Frogs
have no external ears, neck and tail are
absent. Trunk bears a pair of fore limbs
and a pair of hind limbs. At the posterior
end of the dorsal side, between the hind
limbs is the**cloacal aperature**. This is

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ/pic18.png)

the common opening for the digestive,
excretory and reproductive systems.
Fore limbs are short, stumpy, and
helps to bear the weight of the body. They
are also helpful for the landing of the frog
after leaping. Each **forelimb** consists of an
upper arm, fore arm and a hand. Hand
bears four digits. **Hind limbs** are large,
long and consist of thigh, shank and foot.
Foot bears five long webbed toes and
one small spot called the sixth toe. These
are adaptations for leaping and swimming.
When the animal is at rest, the hind limbs
are kept folded in the form of letter **‘Z’**.
**Sexual dimorphism** is exhibited clearly
during the breeding season. The male frog
has a pair of **vocal sacs** and a copulatory or
**nuptial pad** on the ventral side of the first
digit of each forelimb (Figure 4.16). Vocal
sacs assist in amplifying the croaking
sound of frog. Vocal sacs and nuptial pads
are absent in the female frogs.

##### Anatomy
**The Digestive System**
The **alimentary canal** consists of the
buccal cavity, pharynx, oesophagus,
duodenum, ileum and the rectum which
leads to the cloaca and opens outside by the
cloacal aperture. The wide mouth opens
into the buccal cavity. On the floor of the
**buccal cavity** lies a large **muscular sticky**
**tongue**. The tongue is attached in front
and free behind. The free edge is forked.
When the frog sights an insect it flicks out
its tongue and the insect gets glued to the
sticky tongue. The tongue is immediately
withdrawn and the mouth closes. A row
of small and pointed **maxillary teeth** is
found on the inner region of the upper jaw
(Figure. 4.17) In addition **vomerine teeth**
are also present as two groups, one on each
side of the internal nostrils. The lower jaw is
devoid of teeth. The mouth opens into the
buccal cavity that leads to the **oesophagus**
through the **pharynx**. **Oesophagus** is a
short tube that opens into the stomach
and continues as the intestine, rectum
and finally opens outside by the cloaca
(Figure 4. 18). **Liver** secretes bile which
is stored in the gall bladder. Pancreas, a
digestive gland produces pancreatic juice
containing digestive enzymes.
Food is captured by the bifid tongue.
Digestion of food takes place by the
action of Hydrochloric acid and gastric
juices secreted from the walls of the
stomach. Partially digested food called
chyme is passed from the stomach to the
first part of the intestine, the duodenum.
The duodenum receives bile from the gall
bladder and pancreatic juices from the
**pancreas** through a common bile duct.
Bile emulsifies fat and pancreatic juices
digest carbohydrates, proteins and lipids.
Final digestion takes place in the intestine.
Digested food is absorbed by the numerous
finger-like folds in the inner wall of
**intestine** called **villi**and **microvilli**. The
undigested solid waste moves into the
rectum and passes out through the cloaca.

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ/pic20.png)

{{< box title="Do you Know" >}}

**Anus**: The opening at
the lower end of the
alimentary canal in
mammals through which solid waste leaves the body.
**Cloaca:** The common chamber into
which the intestinal, urinary and genital
tracts open. It is present in birds, reptiles,
amphibians, elasmobranch fishes and
monotremes. The cloaca has an opening
for expelling its contents from the body
and in females it serves as the depository
for sperm.

{{< /box >}}

#### Respiratory System
Frog respires on land and in the water by
two different methods. In water, **skin** acts
as aquatic respiratory organ (**cutaneous**
**respiration**). Dissolved oxygen in the
water gets, exchanged through the skin by
diffusion. On land, the **buccal cavity**, skin
and lungs act as the respiratory organs.
In buccal respiration on land, the mouth
remains permanently closed while the
nostrils remain open. The floor of the
buccal cavity is alternately raised and
lowered, so air is drawn into and expelled
out of the buccal cavity repeatedly through
the open nostrils. Respiration by lungs is
called **pulmonary respiration**. The lungs
are a pair of elongated, pink coloured sac-
like structures present in the upper part
of the trunk region (thorax). Air enters
through the nostrils into the buccal cavity
and then to the lungs. During **aestivation**
and **hibernation** gaseous exchange takes
place through skin.

### The Blood-Vascular System

Blood vascular system consists of a **heart** with
three chambers, **blood vessels** and **blood**.
Heart is covered by a double-walled membrane
called **pericardium**. There are two thin walled
anterior chambers called auricles (Atria) and
a single thick walled posterior chamber called
ventricle. **Sinus venosus** is a large, thin walled,
triangular chamber, which is present on the
**dorsal side** of the heart. **Truncus arteriosus** is
a thick walled and cylindrical structure which
is obliquely placed on the **ventral surface** of the
heart. It arises from the ventricle and divides
into right and left **aortic trunk**, which is further
divided into **three aortic arches** namely **carotid**,
systemic and pulmo-cutaneous. The Carotid
trunk supplies blood to the anterior region of
the body. The **Systemic trunk** of each side is
joined posteriorly to form the **dorsal aorta**.
They supply blood to the posterior part of the
body. **Pulmo-cutaneous trunk** supplies blood
to the lungs and skin. Sinus venosus receives
the deoxygenated blood from the body parts by
two anterior precaval veins and one post caval
vein. It delivers the blood to the right auricle; at
the same time left auricle receives oxygenated
blood through the pulmonary vein. Renal
portal and hepatic portal systems are seen in
frog (Figure. 4. 19 and 4. 20).

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ/pic21.png)

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ/pic22.png)

The **blood** consists of **plasma**[60%]
and blood **cells** [40 %] includes red blood
cells, white blood cells, and platelets. RBCs
are loaded with red pigment, nucleated and
oval in shape. Leucocytes are nucleated,
and circular in shape (Figure 4.21).

##### The Nervous System
The Nervous system is divided into the
Central Nervous System [CNS], the **Peripheral**
**Nervous System [PNS]** and the Autonomous
Nervous System [ANS]. **Peripheral Nervous**
**System** consists of 10 pairs of **cranial nerves**
and 10 pairs of **spinal nerves**. **Autonomic**
**Nervous System** is divided into sympathetic
and **parasympathetic** nervous system. They
control involuntary functions of **visceral**
**organs**. CNS consists of the Brain and
Spinal cord. Brain is situated in the cranial
cavity and covered by two meninges called
piamater and duramater. The brain is divided
into forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain.
Fore brain (Prosencephalon) is the anterior
most and largest part consisting of a pair of
olfactory lobes and **cerebral hemisphere**
(as Telencephalon) and a **diencephalon**.
Anterior part of the **olfactory lobes** is narrow
and free but is fused posteriorly. The olfactory
lobes contain a small cavity called **olfactory**
**ventricle**. The mid brain (Mesencephalon)
includes two large, oval **optic lobes** and
has cavities called **optic ventricles**. The
hind brain (Rhombencephalon) consists of
the **cerebellum** and **medulla oblongata**.
Cerebellum is a narrow, thin transverse band
followed by **medulla oblongata**. The medulla
oblongata passes out through the **foramen**
**magnum** and continues as **spinal cord**,
which is enclosed in the vertebral column
(Figure 4.22).

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ/pic24.png)

##### Excretory system
Elimination of **nitrogenous waste**and salt
and water balance are performed by a well
developed excretory system. It consists of a
pair of kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder and
cloaca. Kidneys are dark red, long, flat organs
situated on either sides of the vertebral
column in the body cavity. Kidneys are
**Mesonephric**. Several nephrons are found
in each kidney. They separate nitrogenous
waste from the blood and excrete urea, so
frogs are called **ureotelic** organisms. A
pair of ureters emerges from the kidneys
and opens into the cloaca. A thin walled
unpaired **urinary bladder** is present ventral
to the **rectum** and opens into the **cloaca**.

##### Reproductive system
The **male** frog has a pair of testes which
are attached to the kidney and the dorsal
body wall by folds of peritonium called
mesorchium. Vasa efferentia arise from each
**testis**. They enter the kidneys on both side
and open into the bidder’s canal. Finally, it
communicates with the urinogenital duct
that comes out of kidneys and opens into
the cloaca (Figure 4.23).

![](/books/biology/unit-7/organ/pic25.png)

**Female** reproductive system (Figure 4.24)
consists of paired **ovaries**, attached to the
kidneys, and dorsal body wall by folds of
peritoneum called mesovarium. There is
a pair of coiled **oviducts** lying on the sides
of the kidney. Each oviduct opens into the
body-cavity at the anterior end by a funnel
like opening called ostia. Unlike the male
frog, the female frog has separate genital
ducts distinct from ureters. Posteriorly the
oviducts dilated to form ovisacs before they
open into cloaca. **Ovisacs** store the eggs
temporarily before they are sent out through
the cloaca. Fertilization is external.

Within few days of fertilization, the **eggs**
hatch into **tadpoles**. A newly hatched
tadpole lives off the yolk stored in its body.
It gradually grows larger and develops
three pairs of gills. The tadpole grows and
**metamorphosis** into an air – breathing
carnivorous adult frog (Figure 4.25). Legs
grow from the body, and the tail and
gills disappear. The mouth broadens,
developing teeth and jaws, and the lungs
become functional.

##### Economic importance of Frog

* Frog is an important animal
in the food chain; it helps to
maintain our ecosystem. So
‘frogs should be protected’.

* Frog are beneficial to man,
since they feed on insects
and helps in reducing
insect pest population.
• Frogs are used in
traditional medicine
for controlling blood
pressure and for its anti
aging properties.

* In USA, Japan, China
and North East of India,
frogs are consumed as
delicious food as they
have high nutritive value.

#### Summary
Earthworm, Cockroach and Frog show
characteristic features in body organization.
Lampito mauritii (earthworm) is commonly
found in Tamil Nadu, its body is covered by
cuticle. It has a long and cylindrical narrow
body which is bilaterally symmetrical. All
segments of its body are alike except the 14
to 17 segments, which are thick and dark
and glandular, forming the clitellum. This
helps in the formation of cocoons. A ring
of S-shaped chitinous setae is found in each
segment. These setae help in locomotion.
Earthworm's development is direct and no
larva is formed during development.

  Cockroach is a typical cosmopolitan
insect and exhibits all the fundamental
characteristics of class Insecta. The body of
the cockroach is compressed dorso-ventrally,bilaterally symmetrical, segmented and
divisible into three distinct regions – head,
thorax and Abdomen. The photoreceptor
organ of the cockroach consists of a pair
of compound eyes with mosaic vision.
Segments bear jointed appendages. There
are three throacic segments of each bearing
a pair of walking legs. Two pairs of wings are
present, one pair each on 2nd and 3rd segment.
There are ten segments in abdomen.
Fertilization is internal. The development
of cockroach is gradual through nymphal
stages (paurometabolus).

Frogs are cold blooded vertebrates –
Poikilotherms. Skin is smooth and moist, Red
blood corpuscles are nucleated. Eggs are laid
in water. The larvae pass through an aquatic
stage before metamorphosing into adult.
