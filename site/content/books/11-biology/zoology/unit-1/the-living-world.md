All living forms co-exist with each
other. There are about 8.7 million species
of organisms have been estimated to exist
on earth. A study reports that 86% of all
species on the land and 91% of those in the
seas are yet to be discovered, described and
catalogued. Though humans are placed in
the top most position on the hierarchy,
they have to depend on plants and animals 
for food. Animals are also used as source
of labour, in farming, as pets, and for other
economic benefits. Understanding animals
and their unique characteristics, habitats,
behaviour and evolutionary relationships
is very important. This chapter deals
with, diversity in the living world, need
for classification, types of classification,
taxonomical hierarchy, nomenclature and
tools for studying taxonomy.


### **Diversity in the Living World**
Earth has numerous habitats with a
wide range of living organisms inhabiting
them. Plants and animals are present in
almost all the places, from polar icecaps to
volcanic hot springs, from shallow lagoons
to the deepest oceans, from tropical rain
forests to dry and parched deserts. There are
a variety of species that have been adapted
successfully to live in diverse ecosystems.

Ecosystem is a community of biotic and a
biotic factors and their interrelationships
(A.G. Tansley, 1935). The presence of a
large number of species in a particular
ecosystem is called ‘biological diversity’
or in short ‘biodiversity’. The term
biodiversity was first introduced by
Walter Rosen (1985), and defined by E.D.
Wilson.

### **Characterstic features of living organisms**
Living organisms show a variety of
unique characters different from non-
living matter. The key characters of living
organisms are, cellular organization,
nutrition, respiration, metabolism,
growth, response to stimuli, movement,
reproduction, excretion, adaptation and
homeostasis. Numerous scientists and
taxonomists have made tremendous
contribution and documentation in the
observation and study of even minute
characters in living organisms. Their keen
observations have led to the classification
of living organisms and the study of their
interrelationships.

### **Need for classification**

We come across many places where
things are arranged in specific categories.
In super markets, the shelves can have
rows and columns of groceries, cosmetics,
toys, stationeries, snacks and utensils.
If it is not arranged in a well organized
manner, customers and sales persons
will waste lot of time in finding an item.
In the same way, libraries also organize
the books alphabetically or genres-
wise into autobiographies, novels, kids
stories, science fictions, etc. Likewise it
is nearly impossible to study all the living
organisms. Hence it becomes necessary to
device some means and methods to make
this possible and this process is called
**classification**. Classification is a process
by which things are grouped in convenient
categories, based on easily observable
characters. The scientific term used for
these categories is **taxa** (taxon–singular).
Taxa indicates categories at different
levels, for example Kingdom Animalia,
includes multicellular animals such as
reptiles, mammals, etc. Based on their
characteristics, all living organisms can be
classified into different taxa. This science
of classification is called **taxonomy**.
External and internal structures along with
developmental processes and ecological
information of organisms are essential, as
they form basis of the taxonomical studies.
Hence, characterisation, identification,
nomenclature and classification are the
scientific stages that are basic to taxonomy.

The basic need for classifications are:

* To identify and differentiate closely
related species
* To know the variation among the
species
* To understand the evolution of the
species
* To create a phylogenetic tree
among the different groups
* To conveniently study living
organisms

### **Taxonomy and Systematics**


Taxonomy (G. taxis- arrangement;
nomos-law) is the science of arrangement of
living organisms along with classification,
description, identification, and naming
of organisms which includes all flora and
fauna including microorganisms of the
world. The word taxonomy was coined by
**Augustin Pyramus de Candole** (1813).
Taxonomy is a theoretical study of
classification with well defined principles,
rules and procedures. Aristotle is called
the father of taxonomy (classical) and
**Carolus Linnaeus is** the father of modern
taxonomy.


#### **Systematics (G. System/sequence)**

The objectives of taxonomy and
systematics are very similar; their goal
is to classify organisms with stipulated
rules. The main criteria of systematics
is identifying, describing, naming,
arranging, preserving and documenting
the organisms. Apart from the above
said features, evolutionary history of the
species and the environmental adaptations
and interrelationship between species are
also being investigated in systematics.

{{< box title="DoYou Know" type="objective" >}}

Carolus Linnaeus is
the father of modern
taxonomy, which is
the system of classifying and
naming organisms. One of his
contributions was the development
of a hierarchical system of
classification of
nature. Today,
this system
includes eight
taxa: domain,
k i n g d o m ,
phylum, class,
order, family, genus, and species.

{{< /box >}}

### **History of Classification**
Early classification of organisms were
based on only two criteria, beneficial or
harmful animals. An ancient classification
system recognized 5 animal groups -
domestic, wild, creeping, flying and
sea animals. Initially the classification
was based on organism’s fundamental
characteristics such as the habitat and
morphology only.

**Aristotle** (384 to 322 BC), was the first
to classify all animals in his **History of**
**Animals** (Historia Animalium in Latin).
He attempted a basic classification of all
living organisms into Plants and Animals.
Animals were classified based on
locomotion; walking (terrestrial), flying
(aerial) and swimming (aquatic). Based
on the presence or absence of red blood he
classified the animals into two as Enaima
with blood and those without blood as
*Anaima*.

Aristotle’s classification system had
limitations and many organisms were not
fitting into his classification. For example,
the tadpoles of frogs are born in water and
have gills but when they metamorphosed
into adult frogs they have lungs and can live
both in water and on land. How to classify
frogs and where to place them? Aristotle
classified organisms based on locomotion,
hence, birds, bats, and flying insects were
grouped together just by observing one
single characteristic feature, the flying
ability. On the contrary to the above said
example, the ostrich, emu and penguin
are all birds but cannot fly. So Aristotle
would not have classified them as birds.
In spite of these limitations Aristotle’s
classification system was followed for
more than 2000 years upto 1700.

After Aristotle, his student
**Theophrastus** (372-287 BC) continued
his research on the classification of
plants, and he was known as the “Father
of Botany.” There was a huge gap till
16th century, then the English naturalist
**John Ray** (1627–1705) wrote several
important works through his life. His
most important contribution was the
establishment of species as the ultimate
unit of taxonomy. In 1682 he published
the Methodus Plantarum Nova, which
contained about **18,000** plant species,
a result of a relatively narrow species
concept. His complicated classification
was based on many combined characters,
as opposed to earlier taxonomists. John
Ray also aimed at publishing a complete
system of nature, which included works
on mammals, reptiles, birds, fishes and
insects. The Swedish biologist **Carolus**
**Linnaeus (1707 - 1788)** father of modern
taxonomy and founder of modern
systematics developed a scientific system
of taxonomy and binomial nomenclature,
which is still (with modifications) in use.

Aristotle to Linnaeus employed
easily observable single to few traits
for classification of organisms. With
increased knowledge of the several
biological domains, many characters were
considered for classifying organisms.
This represented the phase of classical
taxonomy which was based on overall
similarities or affinities derived from
morphology, anatomy and embryology of
organisms. A modification of this system
is the numerical taxonomy, which evolved
in the 1950s. This system evaluates the
resemblances and differences through
statistical methods followed by computer
analyses to establish the numerical degree
of relationship among individuals. Later
on biologists initiated studies on the
evolutionary and genetic relationships
among organisms, which led to the emerge of
**phylogenetic classification or cladistics**.
It is an evolutionary classification based
on how a common ancestry was shared.
Cladistic classification summarizes the
genetic differences between all species
in the ‘phylogenetic tree’. **Ernst Haeckal**
introduced the method of representing
evolutionary relationships with the help
of a tree diagram known as **cladogram**.


This system of classification takes
into account ancestral characters (traits
of basic body design which would be in
the entire group) and derived characters
(traits whose structure and functions
differs from those of ancestral characters).
One or more derived characters which
appeared during evolution resulted
in the formation of new subspecies.
In a cladogram each evolutionary
step produces a branching and all the
members of the branch would possess
the derived character which will not be
seen in organisms below the particular
branch point. Arranging organisms
on the basis of their similar or derived
characters which differ from the ancestral
characters produced a **phylogenetic tree**
**or cladogram** (Figure 1.1).

![chpter1](/books/biology/unit-1/zoologylivingworld/pic2.png )


Depending on the system of
classification, organisms were classified
into two or three kingdoms. Later into four,
five, six and now into seven kingdoms.
**R.H.Whittaker** (1969) proposed the **Five**
**kingdom Classification,** the Kingdoms
defined by him were **Monera, Protista,**
**Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia** based
on the cell structure, mode of nutrition,
mode of reproduction and phylogenetic
relationships. Table 1. gives a comparative
account of different characteristics of the
five kingdoms.

Classification has come a long way and
now takes into an account even molecular
level DNA and RNA identification. The
advancement in molecular techniques
and biochemical assays has led to a new
classification - The **“Three Domain”**
**classification.**

### **Three Domains of life**


Three domain classification was
proposed by **Carl Woese** (1977) and his
co-workers. They classified organisms
based on the difference in 16S rRNA
genes. The three domain system adds the
taxon ‘domain’ higher than the kingdom.
This system emphasizes the separation of
Prokaryotes into two domains, Bacteria
and Archaea, and all the eukaryotes are


![chpter1](/books/biology/unit-1/zoologylivingworld/pic3.png )


are placed into the domain Eukarya. Archaea
appears to have more in common with the
Eukarya than the Bacteria. Archaea differ
from bacteria in cell wall composition and
differs from bacteria and eukaryotes in
membrane composition and rRNA types.

1. **Domain Archaea**
This domain includes single celled
organisms, the prokaryotes which have the
ability to grow in extreme conditions like
volcano vents, hot springs and polar ice
caps, hence are also called extremophiles.
They are capable of synthesizing their food
without sunlight and oxygen by utilizing
hydrogen sulphide and other chemicals
from the volcanic vents. Some of the them
produced methane (methanogens), few
live in salty environments (Halophiles)
and are thermoacidophiles which thrive
in acidic environments and at high
temperatures.

{{< box title="DoYou Know" type="objective" >}}

Thermus aquatics is a
bacterium which can
tolerate high temperatures.
The first DNA polymerase enzyme was
isolated from T. aquaticus it is
used in PCR (Polymerase Chain
Reaction) for DNA amplification.

{{< /box >}}

2. **Domain Bacteria**
Bacteria are prokaryotic, their cells
have no definite nucleus and DNA exists
as a circular chromosomes and do not
have histones associated with it. They do
not possess membrane bound organelles
except for ribosome (70S type). Their
cell wall contains peptidoglycans. Many
are decomposers, some are photo-
synthesizers and few cause diseases.
There are beneficial *probiotic* bacteria
and harmful pathogenic bacteria which
are diversely populated. Cyanobacteria
are photosynthetic blue green algae which
produce oxygen. These had played a key
role in the changes of atmospheric oxygen
levels from anaerobic to aerobic during
the early geologic periods.
3. Domain Eukarya (Eukaryotes)
Eukaryotes are animals which have true
nucleus and membrane bound organelles.
DNA in the nucleus is arranged as a
linear chromosome with histone proteins,
ribsosomes of 80S type in the cytosol
and 70S type in the chloroplast and

![chpter1](/books/biology/unit-1/zoologylivingworld/pic4.png )



mitochondria. Organisms in this domain
are classified under kingdoms, namely,
Protista, Fungi, Plantae and Animalia.
In 1987, **Cavalier-Smith** revised the
six kingdom system to **Seven Kingdom
system**. The concept of super kingdom was
introduced and revised to seven kingdom
classification. The classification is divided
into two Super Kingdoms (Prokaryota
and Eukaryota) and seven kingdoms,
two Prokaryotic Kingdoms (Eubacteria
and Archaebacteria) and five Eukaryotic
Kingdoms (Protozoa, Chromista, Fungi,
Plantae and Animalia). (Table 1.1).

**Curd** is one of the best
sources of probiotics, which
are friendly bacteria that
can improve our health.
e.g. Lactobacillus sp.

### **1.5 Taxonomic hierarchy**
In biological classification, the
taxonomical hierarchy includes seven
major categories namely kingdom, phylum,
class, order, family, genus and species and
other intermediate categories such as
subkingdom, grade, division, subdivision,
subphylum, superclass, subclass,
superorder, suborder, superfamily,
subfamily and subspecies.

##### **SpecieS**

Species is the basic
unit of classification in
the taxonomic hierarchial
system. It is a group of
animals having similar
morphological features
(traits) and is reproductively isolated to
produce fertile offspring. There are some
exceptional animals which can produce
**sterile offspring** because of mating with
closely related species (Figure 1.2).
**Genus:** It is a group of closely related
species which have evolved from a common
ancestor. In some genus there is only one
species which is called as **monotypic**

**Figure 1.2 Sterile offsprings**

Male Donkey and Female
Horse results in **Mule**
(Sterile)
Male Lion and Female Tiger
results in **Liger**
Male Tiger and Female Lion
results in **Tigon**

{{< /box >}}

**genus** (e.g. Red panda is the only species
in the genus Ailurus : Ailurus fulgens). If
there are more than one species in the
genus it is known as polytypic genus, for
example ‘cats’ come under the Genus Felis,
which has a number of closely related
species, Felis domestica (domestic cat),
Felis margarita (jungle cat). Felis silvestris
(wild cat)

**Family:** It is a taxonomic category
which includes a group of related genera
with less similarity as compared to genus
and species. For example, the family
Felidae includes the genus Felis (cats)
and the genus Panthera (lions, tigers,
leopards).

**Order:** This category includes an
assemblage of one or more related families
which show few common features. One
or more similar families are grouped
together to form an order. For example,
family Canidae and Felidae are placed in
the order Carnivora.

**Class:** This category includes one or
more related orders with some common
characters. For example order Primata
comprising monkeys, apes and man is
placed in the Class Mammalia, along with
the order Carnivora which includes dogs
and cats.

**Systematics of Human being**

**Recently discovered species in**
**South India**

Scientists have discovered a new and
unusual species of frog in the West-
ern Ghats in India in August 2017.
The frog has shiny, purple skin, a light
blue ring around its eyes, and a pointy
pig-nose. It is named as Bhupathy’s
purple frog (Nasikabatrachus bhupathi)
to honour Dr.Subramaniam Bhupathy,
herpetologist who lost his life in the
Western Ghats in 2014.

![chpter1](/books/biology/unit-1/zoologylivingworld/pic7.png )



{{< /box >}}

**Phylum:** The group of classes with
similar distinctive characteristics
constitute a phylum. The classes Pisces,
Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves and Mammalia
constitute the next higher category,
phylum Chordata. These classes share
some common features like presence of
a notochord and a dorsal tubular nerve
cord hence included in the phylum
Chordata.

**Kingdom:** All living animals
belonging to various phyla are included
in the Kingdom Animalia and it is the top
most of the taxonomic hierarchy.

### **Nomenclature**

*Giza, Inimene, Emberi, Manna,
Doanna, Umano .......*

In all probability these words must be
new to you...but they all mean “Human”
in different foreign languages! There are
presently more than 6000 languages in
the world and an animal can be named
in more than 6000 ways! Unfortunately
it is impossible for anyone to have a good
functioning knowledge of most languages
and hence there arises a need for a
universally accepted scientific naming
system for all organisms. The process of
assigning scientific names to animals or
taxonomic group is called nomenclature.
For example, worldwide, the scientific
name Homo sapiens denotes human.

Classification and grouping were done to
facilitate a deeper understanding of the
unique characteristics of each organism
and its interrelationship among closely
related species. It plays a vital role in
the arrangement of known species based
on their similarities and dissimilarities.
Numerous characters such as morphology,
genetic information, habitat, feeding
pattern, adaptations, evolution, etc., are
examined before an organism is named.
One of the primary responsibilities
of systematic biology is the development
of biological nomenclature and
classification. Nomenclature is not an
end to systematics and taxonomy but it is
necessary in organizing information about
biodiversity. Nomenclature, functions
to provide names for all taxa at all levels
in the hierarchy of life. Naming of the
organisms is done based on the guidelines
of the International Code of Zoological
Nomenclature (ICZN). The scientific
name ensures that each organism has only
one name.

#### Binomial nomenclature (L. Bi-two; Nomen-Name)
Biologists follow universally accepted
principles to provide scientific names
to known organisms. Each name has
two components, a generic name and a
specific epithet. This system of naming
the organism is called Binomial
Nomenclature which was popularised
by Carolus Linnaeus and practised by
biologists all over the world. Example,
the National Bird (Indian Peafowl) –
Pavo cristatus, the National Animal tiger
as Panthera tigris, and the Tamil Nadu
State bird is the common Emerald dove
Chalcophaps indica.


{{< box >}}

* Biological nomenclature
derives from the binomial
(or binominal) nomenclature
that was originally codified
in the works of Linnaeus, Species
Plantarum (1753) and Systema Naturae,
10th Edition (1758). These publications
are the starting points for the modern
biological nomenclature in most groups
of plants and animals.

* If you find an animal with four legs,
with two eyes, paired ear pinna,
covered with fur, possessing
mammary gland , which class will
you position it? How will you give
a binomial name, if you are the first
person to discover and report that
animal.

{{< /box >}}

#### Trinominal nomenclature (Tri – three)
This naming system was proposed by
Huxley and Stricklandt, Trinomen means,
three names: generic name, species name
and sub-species name. When members of
any species which have large variations then
trinomial system is used. On the basis of
dissimilarities, this species gets classified
into subspecies. It is the extension of
binominal nomenclature system which
has an addition of subspecies. All the three
names are set in italics and only the first
letter of generic name is capitalized, if
handwritten then it should be underlined
separately E.g.Corvus splendens splendens
(Indian house crow)

Tautonymy: The practice of naming the
animals in which the generic name and
species name are the same, is called
Tautonymy. e.g. Naja naja (The Indian
Cobra).

What may be the reasons for the
extinction of Dinosaurs? If you know
the reasons for their extinction, why
Sparrows are listed as endangered
species?

{{< /box >}}

##### Rules of Nomenclature
* The scientific name should be italicized
in printed form and if handwritten, it
should be underlined separately.
* The generic name’s (Genus) first
alphabet should be in uppercase.
* The specific name (species) should be
in lowercase.
* The scientific names of any two
organisms are not similar.
* The name or abbreviated name of
the scientist who first publishes the
scientific name may be written after
the species name along with the year of
publication. For example Lion-Felis leo
Linn., 1758 or Felis leo L., 1758.
* If the species name is framed after any
person’s name the name of the species
shall end with i, ii or ae.

For example, a new species of a ground-
dwelling lizard (Cyrtodactylus) has been
discovered and named after Scientist
Varad Giri, Cyrtodactylus varadgirii.

### **Concept of species**
Species is the basic
unit of classification.
The term species was
coined by **John Ray**, and
in his book **“Historia
Generalis Plantarum”**
(3 volumes) in 1693 described species
as a group of morphologically similar
organisms arising from a common
ancestor. Carolus Linnaeus in his book
**“Systema naturae”** considered species as
the basic unit of classification. Species can
be defined as a group of organisms that
have similar morphology and physiology
and can interbreed to produce fertile
offsprings. In 1859 Charles Darwin in
his book **Origin of species** explains the
evolutionary connection of species by the
process of natural selection.

### **Tools for study of taxonomy**
Tools and taxonomical aids may be
different for the study of plants and
animals. Herbarium and Botanical garden
may be used as tools for the study of plant
taxonomy. In the case of animal studies, the
classical tools are Museum, Taxonomical
Keys and Zoological and Marine parks.
The important components of the
taxonomical tools are field visits, survey,
identification, classification, preservation and
documentation. Many tools are being used for
taxonomical studies, amongst them some of
the important tools are discussed below:

{{< box >}}

**Arignar Anna Zoological Park**, also
known as the Vandalur Zoo is in the
south western part of Chennai, Tamil
Nadu, spreads over an area of 1500 acres,
is one of the largest zoological parks in
India. The zoo houses 2,553 species of
both flora and fauna.

{{< /box >}}

##### The classical taxonomical tools
**Taxonomical Keys:** Keys are based on
comparative analysis of the similarities
and dissimilarities of organisms. There
are separate keys for different taxonomic
categories.
**Museum:** Biological museums have
collection of preserved plants and animals
for study and ready reference. Specimens
of both extinct and living organisms can be
studied.
**Zoological parks:** These are places
where wild animals are kept in protected
environments under human care. It enables
us to study their food habits and behaviour.
**Marine parks:** Marine organisms are
maintained in protected enviroments.
**Printed taxonomical tools** consist of
identification cards, description, field guides
and manuals.

##### Molecular taxonomical tools
Technological advancement has
helped to evolve molecular taxonomical
tools from classical tools to molecular
tools. The accuracy and authenticity is
more significant in the molecular tools.
The following methods are being used for
taxonomical classification.
Molecular techniques and approaches
such as **DNA** barcoding (short genetic
marker in an organism’s DNA to identify
it as belonging to a particular species),
**DNA hybridization** (measures the degree
of genetic similarity between pools
of DNA sequences),**DNA fingerprinting**
(to identify an individual from a sample
of DNA by looking at unique patterns in
their DNA), Restriction Fragment Length
Polymorphisms (RFLP) analysis (difference
in homologous DNA sequences that can
be detected by the presence of fragments
of different lengths after digestion of the
DNA samples), and Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR) sequencing ( to amplify a
specific gene, or portion of gene,) are used
as taxonomical tools.

##### Automated species identification tools
It consists of Cyber tools. For example:
ALIS, DAISY, ABIS, SPIDA, Draw wing,
etc.
ALIS → Automated Leafhopper
Identification System.
DAISY → Digital Automated
Identification System.
ABIS → Automatic Bee Identification
System.
SPIDA → Species Identified Automatically
(spiders, wasp and bee wing characters).
Draw wing → Honey bee wing
identification.

**Neo taxonomical tools** – This is based
on Electron Microscopy images to study the
molecular structures of cell organelles.
**Ethology of taxonomical tools** – Based
on the behaviour of the organisms it can
be classified. For example sound of birds,
bioluminescence, etc.
**e-Taxonomic resources** – INOTAXA
is an electronic resource for digital images
and description about the species which
was developed by Natural History Museum,
London. **INOTAXA** means Integrated
Open **TAX**onomic **A**ccess.

#### Summary
Earth has numerous habitats with a
wide range of living organisms inhabiting it.
Living organisms show a variety of unique
characters different from non-living matter.
Classification is the process by which
anything is grouped in a convenient category
based on some easily observable characters.
Taxonomy is the science of
arrangement of living organisms. R. H.
Whittaker proposed the five kingdom
classification. Three domain classification

was proposed by Carl Woese and his co-
workers.

The taxonomical hierarchy includes
seven categories namely kingdom, phylum,
class, order, family, genus and species.
The process of assigning scientific names
to animal or taxonomic group is called
nomenclature. Each scientific name has two
components, generic name and a specific
epithet. The important component of the
taxonomical tools are field visits, survey,
identification, classification, preservation
and documentation. Molecular taxonomical
tools are more accurate, authentic and
significant for taxonimical classification.
