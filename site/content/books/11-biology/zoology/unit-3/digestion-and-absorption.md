We all eat food. If you do not take
breakfast in the morning how do you feel
by noon? The food we eat provides energy
and organic substances for growth and
for replacement of worn and damaged
tissues. It also regulates and coordinates
the various activities that take place in
our body. The components of our food are
carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins,
minerals, fibre and water. We obtain food
from plant and animal sources. The food,
we eat are macromolecules and cannot
directly enter into our cells. These have
to be broken into smaller micromolecules
in absorbable forms, for which we need
a digestive system. Plants however are
autotrophs and synthesize their food,
hence they do not require a digestive
system. The primary function of the
digestive system in the animals is to bring
the nutrients, water and electrolytes from
the external environment into every
cell in the body through the circulatory
system


### 5.1 Digestive system

The process of digestion involves intake
of the food (Ingestion), breakdown of the
food into micromolecules (Digestion),
absorption of these molecules into the
blood stream (Absorption), the absorbed
substances becoming components of
cells (Assimilation) and elimination of
the undigested substances (Egestion).
Digestive system includes the alimentary
canal and associated digestive glands.


##### 5.1.1 Structure of the alimentary ­canal


The alimentary canal is a continuous,
muscular digestive tract that begins with
an anterior opening, the mouth and
opens out posteriorly through the anus.
The alimentary canal consists of mouth,
buccal cavity, pharynx, oesophagus,
stomach, intestine, rectum and anus
(Figure. 5.1). The mouth is concerned
with the reception of food and leads to the
buccal cavity or oral cavity (Figure. 5.2).
Mechanical digestion is initiated in the buccal
cavity by chewing with the help of teeth and
tongue. Chemical digestion is through salivary
enzymes secreted by the salivary glands.

Each tooth is embedded in a socket
in the jaw bone this type of attachment
is called **thecodont**. Human beings and
many mammals form two sets of teeth
during their life time, a set of 20 temporary
milk teeth (deciduous teeth) which gets
replaced by a set of 32 permanent teeth
(adult teeth). This type of dentition is
called **diphyodont**. The permanent teeth
are of four different types (**heterodont**),
namely, ­
Incisors (I) chisel like cutting
teeth, C
­ anines (C) dagger shaped tearing
teeth, Pre molars (PM) for grinding, and
Molars (M) for grinding and crushing.
Arrangement of teeth in each half of the
upper and lower jaw, in the order of I, C,
PM and M can be represented by a dental
formula, in human the ­dental formula is

\\(\dfrac{2123}{2123}*2\\)


Mineral salts like calcium and
magnesium are deposited on the teeth and
form a hard layer of ‘**tartar’ or calculus**
called plaque. If the plaque formed on
teeth is not removed regularly, it would
spread down the tooth into the narrow
gap ­between the gums and enamel and
causes inflammation called **gingivitis**,
which leads to redness and bleeding of the
gums and to bad smell. The hard chewing
surface of the teeth is made of enamel and
helps in mastication of food.

Tongue is a freely movable muscular
organ attached at the posterior end by
the frenulum to the floor of the buccal
cavity and is free in the front. It acts as a
universal tooth brush and helps in intake
food, chew and mix food with saliva, to
swallow food and also to speak. The upper
surface of the tongue has small projections
called papillae with taste buds.

The oral cavity leads into a short
common passage for food and air called
pharynx. The oesophagus and the trachea
(wind pipe) open into the pharynx. Food
passes into the oesophagus through a
wide opening called gullet at the back of
the pharynx. A cartilaginous flap called
epiglottis prevents the entry of food into
the glottis (opening of trachea) during
swallowing. Two masses of lymphoid
tissue called tonsils are also located at the
sides of the pharynx.

![digestion](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig5.1.eng.png )



Oesophagus is a thin long muscular
tube concerned with conduction of the
food to a ‘J’ shaped stomach passing
through the neck, thorax and diaphragm.
A cardiac sphincter (gastro oesphageal
sphincter) regulates the opening of
oesophagus into the stomach (Figure. 5.1).
If the cardiac sphincter does not contract
properly during the churning action of the
stomach the gastric juice with acid may
flow back into the oesophagus and cause
heart burn, resulting in **GERD** (Gastero
Oesophagus Reflex Disorder).

The stomach functions as the temporary
storage organ for food and is located in
the upper left portion of the abdominal
cavity. It consists of three parts – a cardiac
portion into which the oesophagus opens
a fundic portion and a pyloric portion that
opens into the duodenum. The opening
of the stomach into the duodenum is
guarded by the pyloric sphincter. It
periodically allows partially digested food
to enter the duodenum and also prevents
regurgitation of food. The inner wall of
stomach has many folds called **gastric**
**rugae** which unfolds to accommodate a
large meal.

The small intestine assists in the final
digestion and absorption of food. It is the
longest part of the alimentary canal and
has three regions, a ‘U’ shaped duodenum
(25cm long), a long coiled middle portion
jejunum (2.4m long) and a highly coiled
ileum (3.5m long). The wall of the
duodenum has **Brunner’s glands** which
secrete mucus and enzymes. Ileum is
the longest part of the small intestine
and opens into the caecum of the large
intestine. The ileal mucosa has numerous
vascular projections called **villi** which are


![digestion](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig5.2.eng.png )


involved in the process of absorption and
the cells lining the villi produce numerous
microscopic projections called microvilli
giving a brush border appearance that
increase the surface area enormously.
Along with villi, the ileal mucosa also
contain mucus secreting goblet cells
and lymphoid tissue known as **Peyer’s**
**patches** which produce lymphocytes. The
wall of the small intestine bears crypts
between the base of villi called **crypts of**
**Leiberkuhn**(­Figure.5.3)

![digestion](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig5.3.eng.png )


The large intestine consists of caecum,
colon and rectum. The caecum is a small
blind pouch like structure that opens into
the colon and it possesses a narrow finger
like tubular projection called **vermiform**
**appendix**. Both caecum and vermiform
appendix are large in herbivorous animal
and act as an important site for cellulose
digestion with the help of symbiotic
bacteria. The colon is divided into four
regions – an ascending, a transverse, a
descending part and a sigmoid colon. The
colon is lined by dilations called **haustra**
(singular – haustrum) (Figure.5.4).
(singular – haustrum) (Figure.5.4).
The “S” shaped sigmoid colon (pelvic
colon) opens into the rectum. Rectum
is concerned with temporary storage of
faeces. The rectum open out through
the anus. The anus is guarded by two
anal sphincter muscles. The anal mucosa
is folded into several vertical folds and
contains arteries and veins called anal
columns. Anal column may get enlarged
and causes **piles** or **haemorrhoids**.





![digestion](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig5.4.eng.png )


#### 5.1.2 Histology of the Gut

The wall of the alimentary canal from
oesophagus to rectum consists of four
layers (Figure 5.5) namely **serosa**,
**muscularis**, **sub-mucosa** and **mucosa**.
The serosa (visceral peritoneum) is
the outermost layer and is made up of
thin squamous epithelium with some
connective tissues. Muscularis is made of
smooth circular and longitudinal muscle
fibres with a network of nerve cells and
parasympathetic nerve fibres which
controls peristalsis. The ­
submucosal
layer is formed of loose connective tissue
containing nerves, blood, lymph vessels
and the sympathetic nerve fibres that
control the secretions of intestinal juice.
The innermost layer lining the lumen of
the alimentary canal is the mucosa which
secretes mucous.

##### 5.1.3 Digestive glands

Digestive glands are exocrine glands which
secrete biological catalysts called enzymes.
The digestive glands associated with the
alimentary canal are salivary glands, liver
and pancreas. Stomach wall has gastric
glands that secrete gastric juice and the
intestinal mucosa secretes intestinal juice.


![digestion](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig5.5.eng.png )


**Salivary glands**

There are three pairs of salivary glands in
the mouth. They are the largest parotids
gland in the cheeks, the sub-maxillary/
sub-mandibular in the lower jaw and the
sublingual beneath the tongue. These
glands have ducts such as **Stenson’s duct**,
**Wharton’s duct and Bartholin’s duct or**
**duct of Rivinis** respectively (Figure. 5.6).
The salivary juice secreted by the salivary
glands reaches the mouth through these
ducts. The daily secretion of saliva from
salivary glands ranges from 1000 to 1500mL.

**Gastric glands**

The wall of the stomach is lined by
gastric glands. Chief cells or **peptic cells**
**or zymogen cells** in the gastric glands
secrete gastric enzymes and **Goblet cells**
secrete mucus. The **Parietal or oxyntic**
**cells** secrete HCl and an intrinsic factor
responsible for the absorption of Vitamin
\\(B_{12}\\) called **Castle’s intrinsic factor**.


**Liver**

The liver, the largest gland in our body
is situated in the upper right side of the
abdominal cavity, just below the diaphragm.
The liver consists of two major left and right
lobes and two minor lobes. These lobes are
connected with diaphragm. Each lobe has
many hepatic lobules (functional unit of
liver) and is covered by a thin connective


![digestion](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig5.6.eng.png )


tissue sheath called the **Glisson’s capsule**.
Liver cells (hepatic cells) secrete bile which is
stored and concentrated in a thin muscular
sac called the gall bladder. The duct of gall
bladder (cystic duct) along with the hepatic
duct from the liver forms the common bile
duct. The bile duct passes downwards and
joins with the main pancreatic duct to form
a common duct called hepato-pancreatic
duct. The opening of the
hepato-pancreatic duct
into the duodenum is
guarded by a sphincter
called the **sphincter**
**of Oddi** (Figure.5.7).
Liver has high power of
regeneration and liver
cells are replaced by new
ones every 3-4 weeks

Apart from bile
secretion, the liver
also performs several
functions

1. Destroys aging and
defective blood cells

2. Stores glucose in the form of glycogen
or disperses glucose into the blood
stream with the help of pancreatic
hormones


3. Stores fat soluble vitamins and iron

4. Detoxifies toxic substances.


5. Involves in the synthesis of non-
essential amino acids and urea.

![digestion](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig5.7.eng.png )


**Pancreas**

The second largest gland in the digestive
system is the Pancreas, which is a yellow
coloured, compound elongated organ
consisting of exocrine and endocrine cells.
It is situated between the limbs of the ‘U’
shaped duodenum. The exocrine portion
secretes pancreatic juice containing
enzymes such as pancreatic amylase,
trypsin and pancreatic lipase and the
endocrine part called Islets of Langerhans,
secretes hormones such as insulin and
glucagon. The pancreatic duct directly
opens into the duodenum.

### 5.2 Digestion of food and role of digestive enzymes

The process of digestion converts the s ­ olid
food into absorbable and assimilable forms.
This is accomplished by mechanical and
chemical processes.

##### Digestion in the buccal cavity

The smell, sight and taste as well as the
mechanical stimulation of food in the
­
mouth, triggers a reflex action which r ­ esults
in the secretion of saliva. The ­mechanical
digestion starts in the mouth by grinding
and chewing of food. It is called mastication.
The saliva contain water, electrolytes
\\(Na^+,K^+,Cl^-,HCO_3^-\\)
salivary amylase (ptyalin),
antibacterial agent lysozyme and a lubricating
agent mucus (a glycoprotein). The mucus
in saliva prepares the food for swallowing
by moistening, softening, lubricating and
adhering the masticated food into a bolus.
About 30 percent of polysaccharide, starch
is hydrolyzed by the salivary amylase
enzyme into disaccharides (maltose). The
**bolus** is then passed into the pharynx and
then into the oesophagus by swallowing or
**deglutition**. The bolus f ­ urther passes down
through the oesophagus to the stomach by
successive waves of muscular contraction
called **peristalsis**. The **gastro oesphageal**
**sphincter** controls the passage of food into
the stomach.

 ##### Digestion in the stomach  

 Food remains in the stomach for 4 to 5 hours,
the rhythmic peristaltic movement churns
and mixes the food with gastric juice and
make it into a creamy liquid called **chyme**.
The gastric secretion is partly controlled
by autonomic reflexes. The secretion of
gastric juice begins when the food is in the
mouth. The ­gastric juice contains HCl and
proenzymes. The proenzyme pepsinogen,
on exposure to HCl gets converted into the
active enzyme pepsin which converts proteins
into ­proteoses and peptones (peptides). The
HCl provides an acidic medium which is
optimum for pepsin, kills bacteria and other
harmful organisms and avoids putrifaction.
The mucus and bicarbonates present in
the gastric juice play an important role in
lubrication and protection of the mucosal
epithelium from the eroding nature of the
highly acidic HCl (Figure. 5.8). Another
proteolytic enzyme found in gastric juice
of infants is rennin helps in the digestion
of milk protein, caseinogen to casein in
the presence of calcium ions. This e ­ nzyme
secretion gradually reduces with aging.




![digestion](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig5.8.eng.png )

{{< box title="DoYou Know" type="" >}}

Bicarbonates
in
the saliva make the
pH 5.4 to 7.4. If the
bicarbonates level in
saliva is reduced the saliva becomes
acidic and the tooth enamel may get
dissolved.

{{< /box >}}


**Digestion in the small intestine**

The bile, pancreatic juice and intestinal
juice are the secretions released into the
small intestine. Movements generated by
the muscularis layer of the small intestine
helps in the thorough mixing of the food
with various secretions in the intestine and
thereby facilitate digestion.

The bile contains bile pigments (bilirubin
and biliverdin) as the break down products
of hemoglobin of dead RBCs, bile salts,
cholesterol and phospholipids but has no
enzymes. Bile helps in emulsification of
fats. Bile salts reduce the surface tension
of fat droplets and break them into small
globules. Bile also activates lipases to
digest lipids Proteins and partially digested
proteins in the chyme on reaching the
intestine are acted upon by the proteolytic
enzymes of pancreatic juice.The pancreatic
juice contains enzymes such as trypsinogen,
chymotrypsinogen,
carboxypeptidases,
pancreatic amylases, pancreatic lipases
and nucleases. T­rypsinogen is activated
by an enzyme, enterokinase, secreted by
the intestinal mucosa into active trypsin,
which in turn activates the enzyme
chymotrypsinogen in the pancreatic juice.


{{< box title="" type="" >}}

What would happen if HCl is not
secreted in the stomach?

{{< /box >}}


Trypsin hydrolyses proteins into
polypeptides
and
peptones,
while
chymotrypsin hydrolyses peptide bonds
associated with specific amino acids.

The pancreatic amylase converts glycogen
and starch into maltose. Lipase acts on
emulsified fat (triglycerides) and hydrolyses
them into free fatty acid and monoglycerides.
Monoglycerides are further hydrolysed to
fatty acid and glycerol. Nucleases in the
pancreatic juice break the nucleic acid into
nucleotides and nucleosides

The secretions of the Brunner's gland
along with the secretions of the intestinal
glands constitute the intestinal juice or
**succus entericus**. The enzymes in the
intestinal juice such as maltase, lactase,
sucrase (invertase), peptidases, lipases,
nucleotidases and nucleosidases act on the
breakdown products of bile and pancreatic
digestion.


Maltose \\(\underrightarrow{Maltase}\\)   glucose + glucose

Sucrose \\(\underrightarrow{Sucrase}\\) glucose + fructose

Lactose \\(\underrightarrow{Lactase}\\) glucose + galactose

Dipeptides,Tripeptides \\(\underrightarrow{Peptidase}\\) amino acids 


Nucleotides \\(\underrightarrow{Nucleotidase}\\) Nucleoside +Phosphoricacid

Nucleoside \\(\underrightarrow{Nucleosidase}\\) Sugar +­Nitrogen base

Diglycerides and monoglycerides \\(\underrightarrow{Lipases}\\)  Fatty acids + glycerol

The mucus along with the bicarbonate ions
from the pancreas provides an alkaline
medium (pH 7.8) for the enzymatic action.
As a result of digestion, all macromolecules of
food are converted into their corresponding
monomeric units.

Carbohydrates\\(\longrightarrow\\)monosaccharides

(glucose, fructose, galactose)

Proteins \\(\longrightarrow\\) amino acids

Lipids \\(\longrightarrow\\) fatty acids and glycerol

The simple substances thus formed are
absorbed in the jejunum and ileum region
of the small intestine. The undigested and
unabsorbed substances are propelled into
the large intestine. The activities of the
gastro-intestinal tract are carried out by the
neural and hormonal control for proper
coordination of different parts. Gastric
and intestinal ­secretions are stimulated by
neural signals. Hormonal control of the
secretion of d
­ igestive juices is carried out by
local hormones produced by the gastric and
intestinal mucosa.

### 5.3 Absorption and assimilation of proteins, carbohydrates and fats

Absorption is a process by which the end
product of digestion passes through the
intestinal mucosa into the blood and lymph.
The villi in the lumen of ileum are the
absorbing units, consisting of a lacteal duct
in the middle surrounded by fine network of
blood capillaries. The process of absorption
involves active, passive and facilitated
transport. Small amounts of glucose, amino
acids and electrolytes like chloride ions are
generally absorbed by simple diffusion. The
passage of these substances into the blood
depends upon concentration gradients.
However, some of the substances like
fructose are absorbed with the help of the
carrier ions like \\(Na^+\\). This mechanism is
called facilitated transport.

Nutrients like amino acids, glucose and
electrolytes like \\(Na^+\\) are absorbed into the
blood against the concentration gradient by
active transport. The insoluble substances
like fatty acids, glycerol and fat soluble
vitamins are first incorporated into small,
spherical water soluble droplets called
micelles and are absorbed into the intestinal
mucosa where they are re-synthesized
into protein coated fat globules called
chylomicrons which are then transported
into the lacteals within the intestinal villi
and eventually empty into lymphatic duct.
The lymphatic ducts ultimately release
the absorbed substances into the blood
stream. While the fatty acids are absorbed
by the lymph duct, other materials are
absorbed either actively or passively by the
capillaries of the villi (Figure. 5.9). Water
soluble vitamins are absorbed by simple
diffusion or active transport. Transport of
water depends upon the osmotic gradient.

Absorption of substances in the
alimentary canal takes place in mouth,
stomach, small intestine and large intestine.
However maximum absorption takes place
in the small intestine. Absorption of simple
sugars, alcohol and medicines takes place
in the stomach. Certain drugs are absorbed
by blood capillaries in the lower side of
the tongue and mucosa of mouth. Large
intestine is also involved in absorption of
more amounts of water, vitamins, some
minerals and certain drugs.

Absorbed substances are transported
through blood and lymph to the liver
through the hepatic portal system. From
the liver, nutrients are transported to all
other regions of the body for utilization.
All the body tissues utilize the absorbed
substance for their activities and
incorporate into their protoplasm, this
process is called assimilation.




![digestion](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig5.9.eng.png )


### 5.4 Egestion

The digestive waste and unabsorbed
substances in the ileum enter into the
large intestine and it mostly contains
fibre called roughage. The roughage is
utilized by symbiotic bacteria in the large
intestine for the production of substances
like vitamin K and other metabolites.
All these substances are absorbed in the
colon along with water. The waste is then
solidified into faecal matter in the rectum.
The faecal matter initiates a neural reflex
causing an urge or desire for its removal.
The egestion of faeces through the anal
opening is called defaecation. It is a
voluntary process and is carried out by a
peristaltic movement.

### 5.5 Caloric value of carbohydrates, proteins and fats

We obtain 50% energy from carbohydrates
35% from fats and 15% from proteins. We
require about 400 to 500 gm of carbohydrates,
60 to 70 gm of fats and 65 to 75 gm of proteins
per day. Balanced diet of each individual will
vary according to their age, gender, level of
physical activity and others conditions such
as pregnancy and lactation.

**Carbohydrates** are sugar and starch.
These are the major source of cellular fuel
which provides energy. The caloric value of
carbohydrate is 4.1 Kcal per gram and its
physiological fuel value is 4 Kcal per gram.

**Lipids** are fats and derivatives of fats,
are also the best reserved food stored in our
body which is used for production of energy.
Fat has a caloric value of 9.45 Kcal and a
physiological fuel value of 9 Kcal per gram.

**Proteins** are source of amino acids
required for growth and repair of body
cells. They are stored in the body only
to a certain extent large quantities are
excreted as nitrogenous waste. The
caloric value and physiological fuel value
of one gram of protein are 5.65 Kcal and 4
Kcal respectively. According to ICMR
(Indian Council of Medical Research and
WHO (World Health Organization), the
daily requirement of protein for an average
Indian is 1gm per 1 kg body weight.

Many
research
findings have proven
that usage of chemical
preservatives
and
artificial enhancers lead to highly
harmful effects. It includes heart
ailments, hypertension, infertility,
gastrointestinal disorders, early puberty
in girls, weakening of bones, damage
in organs like kidney and liver, chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
diseases,
headache, allergies, asthma, skin rashes
and even cancer. Remember that
nothing will beat and overtake the taste
and safety of homemade foods. "East or
west home preparation is the best."

### 5.6.Nutritional and digestive disorders

Intestinal tract is more prone to bacterial,
viral and parasitic worm infections. This
infection may cause inflammation of the
inner lining of colon called **colitis**. The
most common symptoms of colitis are
rectal bleeding, abdominal cramps, and
diarrhoea.

**Protein energy malnutrition: (PEM)**

Growing children require more amount of
protein for their growth and development.
Protein deficient diet during early stage
of children may lead to protein energy
malnutrition such as **Marasmus and**
**Kwashiorkor**. Symptoms are dry skin,
pot-belly, oedema in the legs and face,
stunted growth, changes in hair colour,
weakness and irritability. Marasmus is an
acute form of protein malnutrition. This
condition is due to a diet with inadequate
carbohydrate and protein. Such children
are suffer from diarrhoea, body becomes
lean and weak (emaciated) with reduced
fat and muscle tissue with thin and folded skin.

**Indigestion**: It is a digestive disorder
in which the food is not properly digested
leading to a feeling of fullness of stomach.
It may be due to inadequate enzyme
secretion, anxiety, food poisoning, over
eating, and spicy food.

**Constipation**: In this condition, the
faeces are retained within the rectum
because of irregular bowel movement due
to poor intake of fibre in the diet and lack
of physical activities.

**Vomiting**: It is reverse peristalsis.
Harmful substances and contaminated
food from stomach are ejected through
the mouth. This action is controlled by
the vomit centre located in the medulla
oblongata. A feeling of nausea precedes
vomiting.

**Jaundice**: It is the condition in which
liver is affected and the defective liver fails
to break down haemoglobin and to remove
bile pigments from the blood. Deposition
of these pigments changes the colour of eye
and skin yellow. Sometimes, jaundice is
caused due to hepatitis viral infections.

**Liver cirrhosis**: Chronic disease of liver
results in degeneration and destruction
of liver cells resulting in abnormal blood
vessel and bile duct leading to the formation
of fibrosis. It is also called deserted liver or
scarred liver. It is caused due to infection,
consumption of poison, malnutrition and
alcoholism.

**Gall Stones**: Any alteration in the
composition of the bile can cause the
formation of stones in the gall bladder. The
stones are mostly formed of crystallized
cholesterol in the bile. The gall stone causes
obstruction in the cystic duct, hepatic duct
and also hepato-pancreatic duct causing
pain, jaundice and pancreatitis.

**Appendicitis**: It is the inflammation
of the vermiform appendix, leading to
severe abdominal pain. The treatment
involves the removal of
appendix by surgery. If
treatment is delayed the
appendix may rupture
and results in infection
of the abdomen, called
**peritonitis**.


**Hiatus hernia (Diaphragmatic hernia)**:
It is a structural abnormality in which superior
part of the stomach p
­ rotrudes slightly above
the diaphragm. The exact cause of hiatus
hernias is not known. In some people, injury
or other damage may weaken muscle tissue,
by applying too much pressure (repeatedly)
on the muscles around the stomach while
coughing, vomiting, and straining during
bowel movement and lifting heavy object.
Heart burn is also common in those with
a hiatus hernia. In this condition, s ­ tomach
contents travel back into the oesophagus or
even into oral cavity and causes pain in the
centre of the chest due to the eroding nature
of acidity ­(Figure.5.10).




![digestion](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig5.10.eng.png )

**Diarrhoea**: It is the most common
gastrointestinal disorder worldwide. It
is sometimes caused by bacteria or viral
infections through food or water. When the
colon is infected, the lining of the intestine
is damaged by the pathogens, thereby
the colon is unable to absorb fluid. The
abnormal frequency of bowel movement
and increased liquidity of the faecal
discharge is known as diarrhoea. Unless
the condition is treated, dehydration
can occur. Treatment is known as **oral**
**hydration therapy**. This involves drinking
plenty of fluids – sipping small amounts
of water at a time to rehydrate the body.

**Peptic ulcer**: It refers to an eroded area
of the tissue lining (mucosa) in the stomach
or duodenum. Duodenal ulcer occurs in
people in the age group of 25 - 45 years.
Gastric ulcer is more common in persons
above the age of 50 years. Ulcer is mostly
due to infections caused by the bacterium
**Helicobacter pylori**. It may also be caused
due to uncontrolled usage of aspirin or
certain antiinflammatory drugs. Ulcer may
also be caused due to smoking, alcohol,
caffeine and psychological stress.


{{< box title="" type="" >}}

Nobel Prize for the year 2005 was awarded
to Robin Warren and Barry Marshall
for the discovery of *Helicobacter pylori*
which causes peptic ulcer

{{< /box >}}


**Obesity**: It is caused due to the storage
of excess of body fat in adipose tissue. It
may induce hypertension, atherosclerotic
heart disease and diabetes. Obesity may
be genetic or due to excess intake of food,
endocrine and metabolic disorders. Degree
of obesity is assessed by body mass index
(**BMI**). A normal BMI range for adult is
19-25 above 25 is considered as obese. BMI
is calculated as body weight in Kg, divided
by the square of body height in meters. For
example, a 50 Kg person with a height of
160 cms would have a BMI of 19.5.

That is BMI = \\(\dfrac{15}{(1.6)^2}=19.5\\)

Food adulterants cause harmful effects in the form of headaches,
palpitations, allergies, cancers and in addition reduces the quality
of food. Common adulterants are addition of citric acid to lemon
juice, papaya seeds to pepper, melamine to milk, vanillin for natural
vanillin, red dyes to chillis, lead chromate and lead tetraoxide to
turmeric powder, etc.,

### Summary


The digestive system of human consists
of the mouth (oral cavity), pharynx,
esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large
intestine, rectum and anus. The accessory
digestive glands include the salivary
glands, the liver (with gall bladder) and the
pancreas. The process of digestion involves
intake of the food (Ingestion), breakdown of
the food into micromolecules (Digestion),
absorption of these molecules into the
blood stream (Absorption), the absorbed
substances becoming components of cells
(Assimilation) and elimination of the
undigested substances (Egestion).

Food comprises of macronutrients and
micronutrients. The nutrients required in
larger quantities are called macronutrients,
whereas those required in small quantities
are called micronutrients. Essential
nutrients cannot be synthesized by the
body; they have to be included in the diet.
Macronutrients are lipids, carbohydrates,
proteins and the micronutrients are vitamins
and minerals. Water plays an important role
in the metabolic processes and prevents
dehydration of the body.

Intestinal tract is more prone to bacterial,
viral and parasitic worm infections.
Such infection, called colitis, may couse
inflammation of the inner lining of the colon.
Growing children require more protein
for their growth and development. Protein
deficient diet during early stage of children
may lead to protein energy malnutrition
such as Marasmus and Kwashiorkor.

Alimentary canal faces a conflict between the need of nutrient absorption
and to keep our intestinal tract free from pathogenic bacteria and virus.
About 7 litres of digestive juice are poured into the alimentary canal and
are reabsorbed each day. If this does not happen the body gets rapidly
dehydrated and may lead to reduction in the blood pressure

**Test for Starch**: Add a few drops of iodine to the given warm food sample. If any
starch is present in the given food sample it will change the colour of the iodine
from brown to blue-black.


**Test for protein**: Mix the given food sample with 3mL of water in a test tube. Shake
the mixture, and then add a few drops of Biuret solution. If protein is present, the
colour of the solution will change to purple.


**Test for glucose**: Mix the given food sample with 3mL of water in a test tubes. Shake
the mixture, and then add a few drops of Benedict’s solution. Keep the test tube in
a water bath and heat carefully. If glucose is present, the colour of the solution will
change from blue to green to brick red depending upon the amount of glucose.
