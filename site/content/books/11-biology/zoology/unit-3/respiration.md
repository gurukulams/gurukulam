### Learning Objectives

• Learns to describe
the gross structure of
the human gaseous
exchange system

• Observes and
draws the tissues
and organs associated with the
respiratory system

• Understands the process of
gaseous exchange and transport of
respiratory gases

• Knows the problems associated
with oxygen transport

• Gains knowledge on the ill–effects
of smoking.



We inhale and exhale air. Why is breathing
so important for life? What happens when
we breathe? Why energy is required for the
body to perform various life processes?
Where does the energy come from? We
eat food for energy. Though the above
raised questions look disconnected, we
should know that the process of breathing
is connected to the process of release of
energy from food. Oxygen is utilized by the
organisms to breakdown the biomolecules
like glucose and to derive energy. During
this breakdown carbondioxide, which is
a harmful gas is also released. It is very
obvious that oxygen has to be provided
to cells continuously and the CO 2 to be
released immediately by the cells. So the
need of a respiratory system is essential
for life.

We have discussed in the previous chapter
how food provides energy for growth and
repair of tissues. As mentioned earlier
along with food, oxygen is necessary for
breakdown of glucose to energy. In this
chapter we shall discuss the respiratory
organs of human, the mechanism of
breathing, exchange and transport of
gases and a few respiratory disorders.

The term respiration refers to the
exchange of oxygen and carbondioxide
between environment and cells of our
body where organic nutrients are broken
down enzymatically to release energy.

### 6.1 Respiratory functions

The five primary functions of the
respiratory system are –

i. To exchange \\(O_2\\) and \\(CO_2\\) between
the atmosphere and the blood.

ii. To maintain homeostatic regulation
of body pH.

iii. To protect us from inhaled
pathogens and pollutants.

iv. To maintain the vocal cords
for
normal
communication
(vocalization).

v. To remove the heat produced
during cellular respiration.


### 6.2 Respiratory organs in various organisms

Different animals have different organs
for exchange of gases, depending upon
their habitats and levels of organization.
The amount of dissolved oxygen is very
low in water compared to the amount of
oxygen in the air. So the rate of breathing
in aquatic organisms is much faster than
land animals.

In animals like sponges, coelenterates
and flatworms exchange of gases takes
place through the body surface by simple
diffusion. Earthworms use their moist
skin, whereas insects have tracheal tubes.
Gills are used as respiratory organs in most
of the aquatic Arthropods and Molluscs.
Among vertebrates, fishes use gills whereas
amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals
have well vascularised lungs. Frogs spend
most of their time in water and also use
their moist skin for respiration along with
lungs and bucco pharynx

##### 6.2.1 Human Respiratory System

The respiratory system includes external
nostrils, nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx,
trachea, bronchi and bronchioles and lungs
which contain **alveoli** (Figure 6.1). The
parts starting from the external nostrils
up to the terminal bronchioles constitute
the conducting zone, whereas the alveoli
and the ducts are called the respiratory
zone. The parts of the conducting zone,
humidifies and warms the incoming air.

In human beings, air enters the upper
respiratory tract through the external
nostrils. The air passing through the
nostrils is filtered by fine hairs and mucus
lining the passage. The external nostrils
lead to the nasal chamber which opens into
the nasopharynx which opens through
the glottis of the larynx region into the
trachea. The ciliated epithelial cells lining
the trachea, bronchi and bronchioles
secrete mucus. **Mucus membrane** lining
the airway contains **goblet cells** which
secrete mucus, a slimy material rich in
glycoprotein. Microorganisms and dust
particles attach in the mucus films and
are carried upwards to pass down the
gullet during normal swallowing. During
swallowing a thin elastic flap called
epiglottis prevents the food from entering
into the larynx and avoids choking of food.



![respiration](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig6.1.eng.png )

The trachea is semiflexible tube
supported by multiple cartilaginous rings
which extends up to the midthoracic
cavity and at the level of the 5 th thoracic
vertebra where it divides into right and
left primary bronchi, one bronchus to each
lung. Within the lungs the bronchi divides
repeatedly into secondary and tertiary
bronchi and further divides into terminal
bronchioles and respiratory bronchioles.

Bronchi have ‘C’ shaped curved
cartilage plates to ensure that the air
passage does not collapse or burst as the
air pressure changes during breathing.
The bronchioles are without cartilaginous
rings and have rigidity that prevent them
from collapsing but are surrounded by
smooth muscle which contracts or relaxes
to adjust the diameter of these airways.

The fine respiratory bronchioles
terminate into highly vascularised thin
walled pouch like air sacs called alveoli
meant for gaseous
exchange (Figure 6.2,
6.3). The diffusion
membrane of alveolus is
made up of three layers
– the thin squamous
epithelial cells of the
alveoli, the endothelium
of the alveolar capillaries
and the basement
substance found in
between them. The thin
squamous epithelial
cells of the **alveoli** are
composed of Type I and
Type II cells. Type I cells are very thin
so that gases can diffuse rapidly through
them. Type II cells are thicker, synthesize
and secrete a substance called **Surfactant**.

The lungs are light spongy tissues
enclosed in the thoracic cavity surrounded
by an airtight space. The thoracic cavity is
bound dorsally by the vertebral column
and ventrally by the sternum, laterally by
the ribs and on the lower side by the dome
shaped diaphragm.


The lungs are covered by double
walled pleural membrane containing a
several layers of elastic connective tissues
and capillaries, which encloses the pleural
fluid. Pleural fluid reduces friction when
the lungs expand and contract.

Characteristic features of respiratory
surface:

• surface area must be very large and richly
supplied with blood vessels

• should be extremely thin and kept moist

• should be in direct contact with the
environment

• should be permeable to respiratory gases



![respiration](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig6.2.eng.png )

![respiration](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig6.3.eng.png )


The steps involved in respiration are

i. The exchange of air between the
atmosphere and the lungs.

ii. The exchange of \\(O_2\\) and \\(CO_2\\)
between the lungs and the blood.

iii. Transport of \\(O_2\\) and \\(CO_2\\) by the
blood.

iv. Exchange of gases between the
blood and the cells.

v. Uptake of O2 by the cells for various
activities and the release of \\(CO_2\\)


{{< box title="Do You Know" type="" >}}

**SURFACTANTS**
are the thin non–
cellular
films
made of protein
and phospholipids covering the
alveolar membrane. The surfactant
lowers the surface tension in the
alveoli and prevents the lungs
from collapsing. It also prevents
pulmonary oedema. Premature
Babies have low levels of surfactant
in the alveoli may develop the new
born respiratory ­distress syndrome
(NRDS) because the synthesis of
surfactants begins only after the
\\(25^{th}\\) week of gestation.

### 6.3 Mechanism of breathing

The movement of air between the atmosphere
and the lungs is known as ventilation or
breathing. Inspiration and expiration are the
two phases of breathing. Inspiration is the
movement of atmospheric air into the lungs
and expiration is the movement of alveolar
air that diffuse out of the lungs. (Figure 6.4)


Lungs do not contain muscle fibres but
expands and contracts by the movement of
the ribs and diaphragm. The diaphragm is
a sheet of tissue which separates the thorax
from the abdomen. In a relaxed state, the
diaphragm is domed shaped. Ribs are moved
by the intercostal muscles. External and
internal intercostal muscles found between
the ribs and the diaphragm helps in creating
pressure gradients. Inspiration occurs if the
pressure inside the lungs (intrapulmonary
pressure) is less than the atmospheric
pressure likewise expiration takes place
when the pressure within the lungs is higher
than the atmospheric ­pressure.


![respiration](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig6.4.eng.png )

**Events in inspiration and expiration**

| **Inspiration** 	| **Expiration** 	|
|:---:	|:---:	|
| Respiratory centre initiates the stimuli<br>during inspiration.<br>\\(\darr\\) 	| Respiratory centre terminates the stimuli<br>during expiration.<br>\\(\darr\\) 	|
| The diaphragm and exspiratory muscles<br>contract.<br>\\(\darr\\) 	| The diaphragm relax but internal<br>intercostal muscles contract.<br>\\(\darr\\) 	|
| The thoracic volume increases as the<br>chest wall expands.<br>\\(\darr\\) 	| The thoracic volume decreases as the chest<br>wall contracts.<br>\\(\darr\\) 	|
| The intra pulmonary pressure is­reduced.<br>\\(\darr\\) 	| The intra pulmonary pressure is increased<br>\\(\darr\\) 	|
| The alveolar pressure decreases than<br>the atmospheric pressure<br>\\(\darr\\) 	| The alveolar pressure increases than the<br>atmospheric pressure<br>\\(\darr\\) 	|
| Air is taken inside due to expansion of<br>alveoli.<br>\\(\darr\\) 	| Air is sent out due to the contraction of<br>alveoli.<br>\\(\darr\\) 	|
| Air flows into the alveoli until the alveolar<br>pressure equalizes the atmospheric<br>pressure and the alveoli get inflated. 	| Air flows out of the alveoli until the alveolar<br>pressure equalizes the atmospheric<br>pressure and the alveoli get deflated. 	|









Inspiraton is initiated by the ­contraction
of the diaphragm muscles and external
intercostal muscles, which pulls the ribs
and sternum upwards and outwards and
increases the volume of the thoracic
chamber in the dorso–ventral axis, forcing
the lungs to expand the pulmonary volume.
The increase in pulmonary volume and
decrease in the intrapulmonary pressure
forces the fresh air from outside to enter the
air passages into the lungs to equalize the
pressure. This ­process is called **inspiration**.

Relaxation of the diaphragm allows the
diaphragm and sternum to r ­ eturn to its
dome shape and the internal i ­ ntercostal
muscles contract, pulling the ribs
downward reducing the thoracic volume
and pulmonary volume. This results in an
increase in the intrapulmonary pressure
slightly above the atmospheric p
­ ressure
causing the expulsion of air from the lungs.
This process is called **expiration**.

On an average, a healthy human breathes
12–16 times/minute. An instrument called
**Spiromete**r is used to measure the volume
of air involved in breathing movements for
clinical assessment of a person’s pulmonary
function.

above the sea level. Suddenly you get

are you suffering from? What are the
other symptoms for this disease and how
can it be reduced?

{{< /box >}}


#### 6.3.1 Respiratory volumes and capacities

The volume of air present in various
phases of respiration is denoted as

##### Respiratory volumes: (Figure 6.5)

• **Tidal Volume (TV)** Tidal volume is the
amount of air inspired or expired with
each normal breath. It is approximately
500 mL., i.e. a normal human adult can
inspire or expire approximately 6000
to 8000mL of air per minute. During
vigorous exercise, the tidal volume is
about 4–10 times higher.


**• Inspiratory Reserve volume** **(IRV)**
Additional volume of air a person can
inspire by forceful inspiration is called
Inspiratory Reserve Volume. The
normal value is 2500–3000 mL.

**• Expiratory Reserve volume** **(ERV)**
Additional volume of air a person
can forcefully exhale by forceful
expiration is called Expiratory
Reserve Volume. The normal value is
1000–1100 mL.

**• Residual Volume (RV)** The volume
of air remaining in the lungs after a
forceful expiration. It is approximately
1100–1200 mL.

##### Respiratory capacities:

**• Vital capacity (VC)** the maximum
volume of air that can be moved out
during a single breath following a
maximal inspiration. A person first
inspires maximally then expires
maximally. VC = ERV+TV+IRV

**• Inspiratory capacity (IC)** The total
volume of air a person can inhale
after normal expiration. It includes
tidal volume and inspiratory reserve
volume. IC = TV+IRV

**• Expiratory capacity (EC)** The total
volume of air a person can exhale
after normal inspiration. It includes
tidal volume and expiratory reserve
volume. EC=TV+ERV

![respiration](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig6.5.eng.png )

**• Total Lung Capacity (TLC)** The total
volume of air which the lungs can
accommodate after forced inspiration
is called Total Lung Capacity. This
includes the vital capacity and the
­residual volume. It is approximately
6000mL. TLC=VC+RV

**• Minute Respiratory Volume** The
amount of air that moves into the
respiratory passage per minute is
called minute respiratory volume.

Normal TV = 500mL; Normal
respiratory rate = 12 times/minute

Therefore,
minute
respiratory

volume = 6 Litres/minute (for a ­normal healthy man).




{{< box title="Why do some people snore?" type="" >}}

– Breathing
with a hoarse sound during sleep is
caused by the vibration of the soft palate.
Snoring is caused by a partially closed
upper air way (nose and throat) which
becomes too narrow for enough air to
travel through the lungs. This makes
the surrounding tissues to vibrate and
produces the snoring sound.

{{< /box >}}







{{< box title="" type="" >}}

Healthy lungs contain large amounts
of elastic connective tissue around
the alveoli, containing elastin, which
makes the lung tissue elastic. People
with emphysema and bronchitis have
difficulty in exhaling because the
enzyme elastase destroys the elastin
around the alveoli and reduces the
elasticity of the lungs.

{{< /box >}}


##### Dead space

Some of the inspired air never reaches the
gas exchange areas but fills the respiratory
passages where exchange of gases does not
occur. This air space is called dead space.

Dead space is not involved in gaseous
exchange. It amounts to approximately
150mL.

### 6.4 Exchange of gases

The primary site for the exchange
of gases is the alveoli. The uptake
of \\(O_2\\) and the release of \\(CO_2\\) occur
between the blood and tissues by
simple diffusion driven by partial
pressure gradient of \\(O_2\\) and \\(CO_2\\) .
­ Partial pressure is the pressure
contributed by an individual
gas in a mixture of ­
gases. It is
­ xygen and
represented as p\\(O_2\\) for o
p\\(CO_2\\) for carbon–dioxide. Due to
pressure gradients, \\(O_2\\) from the
alveoli enters into the blood and
reaches the tissues. \\(CO_2\\) enters
into the blood from the tissues and
reaches alveoli for elimination.
As the solubility of \\(CO_2\\) is 20–25
times higher than that of \\(O_2\\), the
partial pressure of \\(CO_2\\) is much
higher than that of \\(O_2\\) (Table 6.1
and Figure 6.6).



##### Respiratory pigments

**Haemoglobin**

Haemoglobin belongs to the class
of conjugated protein. The iron
containing pigment portion haem
constitutes only 4% and the rest
colourless protein globin belongs
to histone classs. Haemoglobin
has a molecular weight of 68,000
daltons and contains four atoms of
iron, each of which can combine with a
molecule of oxygen.

**Methaemoglobin**

If the iron component of the haem
moieties is in the ferric state, than
the normal ferrous state, it is called
methaemoglobin. Methaemoglobin does
not bind \\(O_2\\). Normally RBC contains less
than 1% methaemoglobin.

**Table 6.1** Partial pressure of Oxygen and Carbon dioxide (in mmHg) in comparison to
those gases in the atmosphere



### 6.5 Transport of gases


##### 6.5.1 Transport of oxygen


Molecular oxygen is carried in blood in
two ways bound to haemoglobin within
the red blood cells and dissolved in
plasma. Oxygen is poorly soluble in water,
so only 3% of the oxygen is transported
in the dissolved form. 97% of ­oxygen
binds with haemoglobin in a reversible
manner to form oxyhaemoglobin
\\(HbO_2\\). The rate at which haemoglobin
binds with \\(O_2\\) is regulated by the partial
pressure of \\(O_2\\) . Each haemoglobin
carries maximum of four molecules of

![digestion](/books/biology/zoounit3/Fig6.7.eng.png )

oxygen. In the alveoli high p\\(O_2\\) , low
p\\(CO_2\\) , low temperature and less H +
concentration, favours the formation of
oxyhaemoglobin, whereas in the tissues
low p\\(O_2\\), high p\\(CO_2\\) , high H + and high
temperature favours the dissociation of
oxygen from oxyhaemoglobin.



{{< box title="" type="" >}}

Breathing through nose is healthier
than through mouth– Why?

{{< /box >}}


A sigmoid curve (S–shaped) is
obtained when percentage saturation
of haemoglobin with oxygen is plotted
against p\\(O_2\\). This curve is called
oxygen­haemoglobin dissociation
curve
(Figure
6.7).
This
S–shaped curve has a steep slope
for p\\(O_2\\) values between 10 and
50mmHg and then flattens b­etween
70 and 100 mm Hg.

Under normal physiological
conditions, every 100mL of
oxygenated blood can deliver
about 5mL of \\(O_2\\) to the ­tissues.



##### 6.5.2 Transport of Carbondioxide

Blood transports \\(CO_2\\) from the
tissue cells to the lungs in three
ways.

**i. Dissolved in plasma** About
7 – 10% of \\(CO_2\\) is transported in a
dissolved form in the plasma.

**ii. Bound to haemoglobin** About
20 – 25% of dissolved \\(CO_2\\) is
bound and carried in the RBCs as
carbaminohaemoglobin (Hb \\(CO_2\\) )

\\(CO_2\\)+Hb\\(\rightleftarrows\\)Hb \\(CO_2\\)


**iii. As bicarbonate ions in plasma**
about 70% of \\(CO_2\\) is transported as
bicarbonate ions

This is influenced by p\\(CO_2\\) and the
degree of haemoglobin oxygenation.
RBCs contain a high concentration of
the enzyme, carbonic anhydrase, whereas
small amounts of carbonic ­anhydrase is
present in the plasma.

At the tissues the p\\(CO_2\\) is high due to
catabolism and diffuses into the blood
to form \\(HCO_{3}^–\\) and H + ions. When \\(CO_2\\)
diffuses into the RBCs, it combines with
water forming carbonic acid \\(H_2{CO}_3\\)
catalyzed
by
carbonic
anhydrase.


Carbonic acid is unstable and dissociates
into hydrogen and bicarbonate ions.
Carbonic anhydrase facilitates the
reaction in both directions.


\\(CO_2\\)+\\(H_{2}O\\)\\(\xLeftrightarrow{carbonic anhydrase}\\)\\(H_2{CO}_3\\)

   \\( \xLeftrightarrow{carbonic anhydrase}\\)\\(HCO_{3}^–\\)\\(H^+\\)
    

                            


The \\(HCO_{3}^–\\) moves quickly from the RBCs
into the plasma, where it is carried to the
lungs. At the alveolar site where p\\(CO_2\\) is
low, the reaction is reversed leading to the
formation of \\(CO_2\\) and water. Thus \\(CO_2\\)
trapped as \\(HCO_{3}^–\\) at the tissue level it is
transported to the alveoli and released
out as \\(CO_2\\) . Every 100mL of deoxygenated
blood delivers 4mL of \\(CO_2\\) to the alveoli
for elimination.



### 6.6 Regulation of Respiration

A specialised respiratory centre present
in the medulla oblongata of the hind
brain called **respiratory rhythm centre**
is responsible for this regulation.
**Pneumotaxic centre** present in pons varoli
region of the brain moderates the function
of the respiratory rhythm centre to ensure
normal breathing. The chemosensitive
area found close to the rhythm centre is
highly sensitive to \\(CO_2\\) and \\(H^+\\) . And \\(H^+\\)
are eliminated out by respiratory process.
Receptors associated with the aortic arch
and carotid artery send necessary signals
to the rhythm centre for remedial action.
The role of \\(O_2\\) is insignificant in the
regulation of respiratory rhythm.


{{< box title="" type="" >}}

**Particulate matter PM 2.5** in the air
is increasing day by day which causes
respiratory illness. Central Pollution
Control Board (CPCB) reports that the
quality of air is not good due to soot and
smoke. So some cities in India are using
CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) as fuel.

{{< /box >}}

### 6.7 Problems in Oxygen transport

When a person travels quickly from sea
level to elevations above 8000ft, where
the atmospheric pressure and partial
pressure of oxygen are lowered, the
individual responds with symptoms
of **acute mountain sickness** (AMS)–
headache, shortness of breath, nausea
and dizziness due to poor binding of \\(O_2\\)
with haemoglobin. When the person
moves on a long–term basis to mountains
from sea level is the body begins to
make respiratory and haematopoietic
adjustments. To overcome this situation
kidneys accelerate production of the
hormone erythropoietin, which stimulates
the bone marrow to produce more RBCs.

When a person descends deep into
the sea, the pressure in the surrounding
water increases which causes the lungs
to decrease in volume. This decrease in
volume increases the partial pressure of
the gases within the lungs. This effect can
be beneficial, because it tends to drive
additional oxygen into the circulation, but
this benefit also has a risk, the increased
pressure can also drive nitrogen gas into
the circulation. This increase in blood
nitrogen content can lead to a condition
called **nitrogen narcosis**. When the
diver ascends to the surface too quickly a
condition called **‘bends’ or decompression**
**sickness** occurs and nitrogen comes out of
solution while still in the blood forming
bubbles. Small bubbles in the blood are
not harmful, but large bubbles can lodge
in small capillaries, blocking blood flow or
can press on nerve endings. Decompression
sickness is associated with pain in joints
and muscles and neurological problems
including stroke. The risk of nitrogen
narcosis and bends is common in **scuba**
**divers**.

{{< box title="Do You Know" type="" >}}

**Allergy** is caused by
allergens. When we
enter a polluted area,
immediately we start
sneezing and coughing. The allergens
in that place affect our respiratory tracts
and the responses to the allergens start
within minutes. Allergens provoke an
inflammatory response. A common
manifestation of allergy is Asthma.

{{< /box >}}


During carbon–dioxide poisoning, the
demand for oxygen increases. As the \\(O_2\\) level
in the blood decreases it leads to suffocation
and the skin turns bluish black.

### 6.8 Disorders of the Respiratory system


Respiratory system is highly affected by
environmental, occupational, personal
and social factors. These factors may be
responsible for a number of respiratory
disorders. Some of the disorders are
discussed here.

**Asthma** – It is characterized by narrowing
and inflammation of bronchi and
bronchioles and difficulty in breathing.
Common allergens for asthma are dust,
drugs, pollen grains, certain food items
like fish, prawn and certain fruits etc.

**Emphysema**– Emphysema is chronic
breathlessness
caused
by
gradual
breakdown of the thin walls of the alveoli
decreasing the total surface area of a
gaseous exchange. i.e., widening of the
alveoli is called emphysema. The major
cause for this disease is cigarette smoking,
which reduces the respiratory surface of
the alveolar walls.

**Bronchitis**– The bronchi when it gets
inflated due to pollution smoke and
cigarette smoking, causes bronchitis. The
symptoms are cough, shortness of breath
and sputum in the lungs.

**Pneumonia**– Inflammation of the lungs
due to infection caused by bacteria or
virus is called pneumonia. The common
symptoms are sputum production, nasal
congestion, shortness of breath, sore
throat etc.

**Tuberculosis**– Tuberculosis is caused by
*Mycobacterium tuberculae*. This infection
mainly occurs in the lungs and bones.
Collection of fluid between the lungs and
the chest wall is the main complication of
this disease.

**Occupational respiratory disorders**–
The disorders due to one’s occupation
of working in industries like grinding or
stone breaking, construction sites, cotton
industries, etc. Dust produced affects the
respiratory tracts.


Long exposure can give rise to
inflammation
leading
to
fibrosis.
**Silicosis** and **asbestosis** are occupational
respiratory diseases resulting from
inhalation of particle of silica from sand
grinding and asbestos into the respiratory
tract. Workers, working in such industries
must wear protective masks.


### 6.9 Effects of Smoking

Today due to curiosity, excitement or
adventure youngsters start to smoke and
later get addicted to smoking. Research
says about 80% of the lung cancer is due
to cigarette smoking.


Smoking is inhaling the smoke from
burning tobacco. There are thousands of
known chemicals which includes nicotine,
tar, carbon monoxide, ammonia, sulphur–
dioxide and even small quantities of
arsenic. Carbon monoxide and nicotine
damage the cardiovascular system and tar
damages the gaseous exchange system.
Nicotine is the chemical that causes
addiction and is a stimulant which makes
the heart beat faster and the narrowing
of blood vessels results in raised blood
pressure and coronary heart diseases.

Presence of carbon monoxide reduces
oxygen supply. Lung cancer, cancer of the
mouth and larynx is more common in
smokers than non–smokers. Smoking also
causes cancer of the stomach, pancreas and
bladder and lowers sperm count in men.
Smoking can cause lung diseases by
damaging the airways and alveoli and results
in emphysema and chronic bronchitis.
These two diseases along with asthma are
often referred as **Chronic Obstructive**
**Pulmonary Disease** (COPD). When a
person smokes, nearly 85% of the smoke
released is inhaled by the smoker himself
and others in the vicinity, called **passive**
**smokers**, are also affected. Guidance or
counselling should be done in such users
to withdraw this habit.


### Summary

The process of intake of oxygen rich air
and giving out of air rich in carbon dioxide
is generally called respiration. Pollutants
and microorganisms are filtered from the
inspired air by the hair and mucus present
in the nostrils. The two main steps in the
mechanism of respiration are inspiration and
expiration which takes place due to pressure
gradient in the atmosphere and lungs.

\\(O_2\\) is transported in blood in dissolved
form and is also bound to haemoglobin.
One molecule of haemoglobin can bind four
molecules of \\(O_2\\) . The Sigmoid shape of the
\\(O_2\\) haemoglobin dissociative curve shows
increased affinity for each \\(O_2\\) molecule.

\\(CO_2\\) is transported in blood in dissolved
form as carbamino haemoglobin and as
\\(H_2{CO}_3\\). \\(HCO_{3}^–\\) is produced in RBCs from \\(CO_2\\)
and water catalysed by ­carbonic anhydrase.
Breathing is controlled by medullary
respiratory centre.

Respiratory volumes and capacities
indicate the amount of air inspired and
expired during normal respiration. Our
respiratory system can be affected by
pollutants, pathogens and other chemical
substances found in air. Lung cancer and
emphysema cannot be cured and these
diseases are common among cigarette
smokers.

People at higher level than the sea level
are prompted to altitude sickness as the
barometric pressure is low in those regions.
Surfactant, emphysema, Asthma and Dead
space have been discussed. During vigorous
exercise the rate of respiration increases.



{{< box title="Activity" type="" >}}

------------------------------------

To test the presence of \\(CO_2\\) in ­exhaled air Take two test tubes A and B with few mL
of clear lime water. Blow exhaled air into A with a help of a straw and pass normal air
into B with a help of a syringe for about 15 times and observe the changes that occur in
the tubes A and B. The lime water (Calcium Hydroxide) in the test tube A turns milky.
