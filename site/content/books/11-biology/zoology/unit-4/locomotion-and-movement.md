Have you ever wondered how a dancer
performs intricate dance steps or how
a swimmer skillfully does a butterfly
stroke? The muscles of our body work
simultaneously with one another and
with the skeletal system to perform the
various movements. Our muscles have
two functions: to generate motion and
force. All these activities are controlled
and coordinated by the skeletal, muscular
and nervous system. The human body
is capable of a wide range of movements
from the gentle blinking of eye to running
a 20 km marathon. Movement of organism
from one place to another in search of food,
shelter, mate and to escape from predators

is called locomotion. Locomotion has
evolutionary significance.



#### 9.1 Types of movement
The different types of movements that
occur in the cells of our body are amoeboid,
ciliary, flagellar and muscular movement.
Amoeboid movement - Cells such as
macrophages exhibit amoeboid movement








for engulfing pathogens by pseudopodia
formed by the streaming movement of the
cytoplasm.

**Ciliary movement -** This type of
movement occurs in the respiratory
passages and genital tracts which are lined
by ciliated epithelial cells.

**Flagellar movement -** This type of
movement occurs in the cells which
are having flagella or whip-like motile
organelle. The sperm cells show flagellar
movement.

**Muscular movement -** The movement
of hands, legs, jaws, tongue are caused
by the contraction and relaxation of the
muscle which is termed as the muscular
movement.

#### 9.2. Types of muscles**

Muscles are specialized tissues which are
derived from the embryonic **mesoderm**.
They are made of cells called **myocytes**
and constitute 40 – 50 percent of body
weight in an adult. These cells are bound
together by a connective tissue to form a
muscular tissue. The muscles are classified
into three types, namely **skeletal, visceral**
and **cardiac muscles.**

#### 9.3 Skeletal muscle**

**(Voluntary muscle)**

Skeletal muscle is attached to the bone
by a bundle of collagen fibres known
as **tendon**. Each muscle is made up of
bundles of **muscle fibres** called **fascicle**.
Each muscle fibre contains hundreds
to thousands of rod-like structures
called **myofibrils** that run parallel to its
length. The connective tissue covering


the whole muscle is the epimysium ,
the covering around each fascicle is the
perimysium and the muscle fibre is
surrounded by the endomysium. They
control the voluntary actions such as
walking, running, swimming, writing
hence termed as voluntary muscles.



##### 9.3.1 Structure of a skeletal muscle
fibre
Each muscle fibre is thin and elongated.
Most of them taper at one or both ends.
Muscle fibre has multiple oval nuclei
just beneath its plasma membrane or
sarcolemma. The cytoplasm of the muscle
fibre is called the sarcoplasm. It contains
glycosomes, myoglobin and sarcoplasmic
reticulum. Myoglobin is a red- coloured
respiratory pigment of the muscle fibre.
It is similar to haemoglobin and contains
iron group that has affinity towards oxygen
and serves as the reservoir of oxygen.
Glycosomes are the granules of stored
glycogen that provide glucose during the
period of muscle fibre activity. Actin and
myosin are muscle proteins present in the
muscle fibre.
Along the length of each myofibril
there are a repeated series of dark and light
bands (Figure 
9.1). The dark A-bands
(Anisotropic bands) and the light I-bands
(Isotropic bands) are perfectly aligned
with one another. This type of arrangement
gives the cell a striated appearance. Each
dark band has a lighter region in its middle
called the H-Zone (H-Helles: means
clear). Each H-zone is bisected vertically
by a dark line called the M-line (M-for
middle). The light I-bands also have
a darker mid line area called the
Z–disc (from the German





"Zwischenscheibe" the disc inbetween the
I-bands).

The myofibrils contain the contractile
element, the **sarcomere** which is the
functional unit of the skeletal muscle. A
Sarcomere is the region of a myofibril
between two successive Z-discs. It
contains an A-band with a half I-band at
each end. Inside the sarcomere two types
of filaments are present namely the **thick**
and **thin filaments**.

The thick filaments extend the entire
length of the A-band, the thin filaments
extend across the I-band and partly into
the A-band. The invagination of the
sarcolemma forms transverse tubules
**(T–tubules)** and they penetrate into the
junction between the A and I-bands.

#### 9.4 Structure of contractile**

**proteins**
Contraction of the muscle depends on the
presence of contractile proteins (Figure

9.2) such as **actin** and **myosin** in the


myofilaments. The thick filaments are
composed of the protein myosin which are
bundled together whose heads produce
at opposite ends of the filament. Each
myosin molecule is made up of a monomer
called meromyosin. The meromyosin has
two regions, a globular head with a short
arm and a tail. The short arm constitutes
the heavy meromyosin (HMM). The
tail portion forms the light meromyosin
(LMM). The head bears an actin-binding
site and an ATP- binding site. It also
contains ATPase enzyme that split ATP
to generate energy for the contraction of
muscle. The thin filaments are composed
of two interwined actin molecules. Actin
has polypeptide subunits called globular
actin or G–actin and filamentous form or
F-actin. Each thin filament is made of two
F-actins helically wound to each other.
Each F-actin is a polymer of monomeric
G-actins. It also contains a binding site
for myosin. The thin filaments also

sliding-filament theory to explain muscle
contraction. According to this theory,
overlapping actin and myosin filaments of
fixed length slide past one another in an
energy requiring process, resulting in muscle
contraction. The contraction of muscle fibre
is a remarkable process that helps in creating
a force to move or to resist a load. The force
which is created by the contracting muscle is
called muscle tension. The load is a weight or
force that opposes contraction of a muscle.
Contraction is the creation of tension in
the muscle which is an active process and
relaxation is the release of tension created by
contraction. Muscle contraction is initiated by
a nerve impulse sent by the central nervous
system (CNS) through a motor neuron. The
junction between the motor neuron and the
sarcolemma of the muscle fibre is called the
neuromuscular junction or motor end plate.
When nerve impulse reaches a neuromuscular
junction, acetylcholine is released. It initiates
the opening of multiple gated channels in
sarcolemma. The action potential travels
along the T-tubules and triggers the release of
calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
The released calcium ions bind to troponin
on thin filaments. The tropomyosin uncovers
the myosin-binding sites on thin filaments.
Now the active sites are exposed to the heads
of myosin to form a cross-bridge (Figure

9.3). During cross-bridge formation actin
and myosin form a protein complex called
actomyosin. Utilizing the energy released
from hydrolysis of ATP, the myosin head
rotates until it forms a 90° angle with the long
axis of the filament. In this position myosin
binds to an actin and activates a contraction –
relaxation cycle which is followed by a power
stroke.


Figure 
9. 2 Composition of thick and thin
filaments



contain several regulatory proteins like
**tropomyosin** and **troponin** which help
in regulating the contraction of muscles
along with **actin** and **myosin**.

#### 9.5 Mechanism of muscle**

**contraction**

**Sliding filament theory:** In 1954, Andrew F.
Huxley and Rolf Niedergerke proposed the






The power stroke (cross-bridge tilting)

begins after the myosin head and hinge region
tilt from a 90° angle to a 45° angle. The cross-
bridge transforms into strong, high-force
bond which allows the myosin head to swivel.
When the myosin head swivels it pulls the
attached actin filament towards the centre of
the A-band. The myosin returns back to its
relaxed state and releases ADP and phosphate
ion. A new ATP molecule then binds to the
head of the myosin and the cross-bridge is
broken. At the end of each power stroke, each
myosin head detaches from actin, then swivels


back and binds to a new
actin molecule to start
another contraction
cycle. This movement
is similar to the motion
of an oar on a boat. At
the end of each power
stroke, each myosin head
detaches from actin, then
swivels back and binds to
a new actin molecule to
start another contraction
cycle. The power stroke
repeats many times until
a muscle fibre contracts.
The myosin heads bind,
push and release actin
molecules over and over
as the thin filaments move
toward the centre of the
sarcomere. The repeated
formation of cross-bridge
cycles cause the sliding
of the filaments only but
there is no change in
the lengths of either the
thick or thin filaments.
The Z- discs attached
to the actin filaments
are also pulled inwards from both the sides,
causing the shortening of the sarcomere (i.e.
contraction). This process continues as long
as the muscle receives the stimuli and with
a steady flow of calcium ions. When motor
impulse stops, the calcium ions are pumped
back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum which
result in the masking of the active sites of the
actin filaments.The myosin head fails to bind
with the active sites of actin and these changes
cause the return of Z- discs back to their
original position, i.e. relaxation. (Figure 
9.3)


**Figure 
9.3** Cross-bridge cycle of muscle contraction







9.6. Types of skeletal muscle
contraction
There are two primary types of muscle
contractions. They are isotonic
contraction and isometric contraction.
The types of contractions depend on the
changes in the length and tension of the
muscle fibres at the time of its contraction.


Isotonic contraction (iso- same, ton-
weight/resistance)
In isotonic contraction the length of the
muscle changes but the tension remains
constant. Here, the force produced is
unchanged. Example: lifting dumb bells and
weightlifting.


Isometric contraction ( iso- same,
metric-distance)
In isometric contraction the length of the
muscle does not change but the tension
of the muscle changes. Here, the force
produced is changed. Example: pushing
against a wall, holding a heavy bag.


Types of skeletal muscle fibres
The muscle fibres can be classified on the
basis of their rate of shortening, either fast

or slow and the way in which they produce
the ATP needed for contraction, either
oxidative or glycolytic. Fibres containing
myosin with high ATPase activity are
classified as fast fibres and with lower
ATPase activity are classified as slow
fibres. Fibres that contain numerous
mitochondria and have a high capacity for
oxidative phosphorylation are classified
as **oxidative fibres**. Such fibres depend on
blood flow to deliver oxygen and nutrients
to the muscles. The oxidative fibres are
termed as **red muscle fibres**. Fibres that
contain few mitochondria but possess a
high concentration of glycolytic enzymes
and large stores of glycogen are called
**glycolytic fibres**. The lack of myoglobin
gives pale colour to the fibres, so they are
termed as **white muscle fibres**.

Skeletal muscle fibres are further
classified into three types based on the
above classification. They are slow –
oxidative fibres, fast – oxidative fibres and
fast – glycolytic fibres.

1. **Slow – oxidative fibres** have low rates
    of myosin ATP hydrolysis but have the
    ability to make large amounts of ATP.
    These fibres are used for prolonged,
    regular activity such as long distance
    swimming. Long – distance runners
    have a high proportion of these fibres
    in their leg muscles.
2. **Fast – oxidative fibres** have high myosin
    ATPase activity and can make large
    amounts of ATP. They are particularly
    suited for rapid actions.
3. **Fast – glycolytic fibres** have myosin
    ATPase activity but cannot make as much
    ATP as oxidative fibres, because their
    source of ATP is glycolysis. These fibres


are best suited for rapid, intense actions,
such as short sprint at maximum speed.

Skeletal Muscle
Glycogen Analysis
(SMGA) –Used to
measure an Athlete’s
sporting performance by taking
muscle biopsies. It is a standard
method to measure muscle glycogen.
Muscle glycogen provides the main
source of energy during anaerobic
exercise. Furthermore, total glycogen
stores within the body also contribute
significantly to energy metabolism
in endurance-type events lasting
longer in duration. A single glycogen
molecule may contain 5000 glucose
units compared to that of 5000
individual glucose molecules.



##### 9.7 Skeletal system and its
function
The skeletal system is
constituted by a framework
of bones and cartilages. It is
derived from the embryonic
mesoderm. Muscles are attached to the
bones by means of tendons and provide the
necessary force required for the bones of the
skeleton to operate as levers. There are three
types of skeletal systems. They are,
Hydrostatic skeleton, which is found
in soft-bodied invertebrates. It is a fluid
filled-cavity encircled by muscles (e.g. Earth
worm).





**Exoskeleton,** which is found in invertebrates.
It is a rigid hard case present outside the body of
animals (e.g. Cockroach).

**Endoskeleton,** which is found inside the body
of vertebrates. It is composed of bones and cartilages,
surrounded by muscles. (eg. Human being).

In human beings, the skeletal system is
made up of 206 bones and cartilages. It is
grouped into two principal divisions – the
**axial skeleton** and the **appendicular skeleton**.
The axial skeleton consists of 80 bones and the
appendicular skeleton consists of 126 bones
(Figure 
##### 9.6 and Table.1).

**Functions of skeletal system**

- Support –It forms a rigid framework and
    supports the weight of the body against
    gravity.
- Shape - It provides and maintains the
    shape of the body.
- Protection – It protects the delicate
    internal organs of the body.
- Acts as reservoir – It stores minerals
    such as calcium and phosphate. Fat
    (Triglyceride) is stored in yellow bone
    marrow and represents a source of
    stored energy for the body.
- Locomotion – It acts as lever along
    with the muscles attached to it.
- Strength – It can withstand heavy
    weight and absorbs mechanical shock.
- As a haemopoietic tissue – Red and
    White blood cells are produced in
    the bone marrow of the ribs, spongy
    bones of vertebrae and extremities of
    long bones.
All muscles produce movement, but
only skeletal muscle is responsible for
locomotion. What is meant by this
statement?



9.8 The Axial skeleton
Axial skeleton forms the main axis of the
body. It consists of the skull, hyoid bone,
vertebral column and thoracic cage.
a) The Skull
The skull is composed of two sets of bones

- cranial and facial bones. It consists of 22
bones of which 8 are cranial bones and 14
are facial bones (Figure 
9.5). The cranial
bones form the hard protective outer
covering of the brain and called the brain
box. The capacity of the cranium is 0
cm3..^ These bones are joined by sutures
which are immovable. They are a **paired
parietal, paired temporal** and **individual
bones** such as the **frontal, sphenoid,
occipital and ethmoid**.
    The large hole in the temporal bone
is the **external auditory meatus**. In the
facial bones **maxilla, zygomatic, palatine,
lacrimal, nasal** are paired bones whereas
**mandible** or **lower jaw** and **vomer** are
**unpaired bones**. They form the front part
of the skull. A single U-shaped **hyoid bone**
is present at the base of the buccal cavity.
It is the only one bone without any joint.
Each middle ear contains three tiny bones-
**malleus** , **incus** and **stapes** collectively
are called **ear ossicles**. The upper jaw is
formed of the **maxilla** and the lower jaw is
formed of the **mandible**. The upper jaw is
fused with the cranium and is immovable.
The lower jaw is connected to the cranium
by muscles and is movable. The most
prominent openings in the skull are **the
orbits** and **the nasal cavity**. **Foramen
magnum** is a large opening found at the
posterior base of the skull**.** Through this
opening the medulla oblongata of the brain
descends down as the spinal cord.





**b) The Vertebral Column**
Vertebral column is also called the back
bone. It consists of 33 serially arranged
vertebrae which are interc onnected by
cartilage known as intervertebral disc
(Figure 
9.6). The vertebral column
extends from the base of the skull to
the pelvis and forms the main frame
work of the trunk. The vertebral column
has five major regions. They are, **the
Cervical** , **Thoracic** , **Lumbar** , **Sacrum**
(5 sacral vertebrae found in the infant
which are fused to form one bone in the
adult) and **Coccyx** (4 coccygeal vertebrae
found in the infant which are fused to
form one bone in the adult).

Each vertebra has a central hollow
portion, the neural canal, through which
the spinal cord passes. The first vertebra is
called as **the atlas** and the second vertebra
is called as **the axis**. Atlas is articulated
with the occipital condyles.

The vertebral column protects the
spinal cord, supports the head and serves
as the point of attachment for the ribs and
musculature of the back.

##### 9. 5 Structure of the skull


Anterior view Lateral view


(Figure 
##### 9. 6 Vertebral Column
(c) The Sternum (Chest bone)
Sternum is a flat bone on the mid ventral
line of the thorax. It provides space for
the attachment of the thoracic ribs and
abdominal muscles.
(d) The Rib cage
There are 12 pairs of ribs (Figure 
##### 9.7). Each
rib is a thin flat bone connected dorsally to



0


the vertebral column and ventrally to the
sternum. It has two articulation surfaces
on its dorsal end, hence called bicephalic.
The first seven pairs of ribs are called ‘ true
ribs’ or vertebro–sternal ribs. Dorsally
they are attached to the thoracic vertebrae
and ventrally connected to the sternum
with the help of hyaline cartilages. The 8th,^
9 th and 10th pairs of ribs do not articulate
directly with the sternum but joined with
the cartilaginous (hyaline cartilage) part of
the seventh rib. These are called ‘false ribs’
or vertebro-chondral ribs. The last 11th and
12 th pairs of ribs are not connected ventrally.
Therefore, they are called as ‘floating ribs’
or vertebral ribs. Thoracic vertebrae, ribs
and sternum together form the ribcage.
Rib cage protects the lungs, heart, liver
and also plays a role in breathing.


Figure 
##### 9.7 Rib cage

##### 9.9 The Appendicular
skeleton
The bones of the upper and lower limbs
along with their girdles constitute the
appendicular skeleton. The appendicular
skeleton is composed of 126 bones.
(a) The Pectoral girdle
The upper limbs are attached to the pectoral
girdles. These are very light and allow the


upper limbs a degree of mobility not seen
anywhere else in the body. The girdle is
formed of two halves. Each half of the
pectoral girdle (Figure 
##### 9.8) consists of a
clavicle or collar bone and a scapula. The
scapula is a large, thin, triangular bone
situated in the dorsal surface of the ribcage
between the second and seventh ribs. It has
a slightly elevated ridge called the spine
which projects as a flat, expanded process
called the acromion. The clavicle articulates
with this process. Below the acromion is a
depression called the glenoid cavity which
articulates with the head of the humerus
to form the shoulder joint. Each clavicle is
a long slender bone with two curvatures
which lies horizontally and connects axial
skeleton with appendicular skeleton.


The Upper limb
The upper limb consists of 30 separate
bones and is specialized for mobility. The
skeleton of the arm, the region between
the shoulder and elbow is the humerus.
The head of humerus articulates with the
glenoid cavity of the scapula and forms the
shoulder joint. The distal end of humerus
articulates with the two forearm bones
the radius and ulna. The forearm is the
region between the elbow and the wrist.
Olecranon process is situated at the upper
end of the ulna which forms the pointed
portion of the elbow.The hand consists of
carpals, metacarpals and phalanges.
Carpals, the wrist bones, 8 in number
are arranged in two rows of four each. The
anterior surface of the wrist has tunnel-
like appearance, due to the arrangement of
carpals with the ligaments. This tunnel is
termed as carpal tunnel.

CTS-(Carpal Tunnel Syndrome ) –
The narrow passage (tunnel) bounded
by bones and ligaments in the wrist
gets narrowed and pinches the median
nerve. This syndrome is mostly seen
among the clerks, software professionals
and pregnant women and people who
constantly play or text in mobile phones.

**Metacarpals,** the palm bones are 5 in
number and **phalanges** the digits bones are
14 in number.


Figure 
##### 9. 8 Pectoral girdle with upper limb

**(b) Pelvic Girdle**

The pelvic girdle is a heavy structure
specialized for weight bearing. It is composed


of two hip bones called coxal bones that
secure the lower limbs to the axial skeleton
(Figure 
##### 9.##### 9.. Together, with the sacrum and
coccyx, the hip bones form the basin-like
bony pelvis.
Each coxal bone consists of three fused
bones, ilium, ischium and pubis. At the
point of fusion of ilium, ischium, and pubis
a deep hemispherical socket called the
acetabulum is present on the lateral surface
of the pelvis. It receives the head of the femur
or thigh bone at the hip joint and helps in the
articulation of the femur. Ventrally the two
halves of the pelvic girdle meet and form
the pubic symphysis containing fibrous
cartilage.


Figure 
##### 9.##### 9.Pelvic girdle with lower limb


2

The **ilium** is the superior flaring
portion of the hip bone. Each ilium forms
a secure joint with the sacrum posteriorly.
The **ischium** is a curved bar of bone. The
V-shaped **pubic bones** articulate anteriorly
at the **pubic symphysis**. The pelvis of male is
deep and narrow with larger heavier bones
and the female is shallow, wide and flexible
in nature, and this helps during pregnancy
which is influenced by female hormones.


The pelvic girdle is a heavy, strong
girdle. How does its structure reflect its
function?

**The Lower limb**
The lower limb consists of 30 bones which
carries the entire weight of the erect body
and is subjected to exceptional forces
when we jump or run. The bones of the
lower limbs are thicker and stronger than
the upper limbs. The three segments of
each lower limb are **the thigh** , **the leg**
or **the shank** and **the foot**. **The femur**
is the single bone of the thigh. It is the
largest, longest and strongest bone in
the body. The head of femur articulates
with **the acetabulum** of the pelvis to
form the hip joint. Two parallel bones,
**the tibia** and **fibula** , form the skeleton
of the shank. A thick, triangular **patella**
forms the knee cap, which protects the
knee joint anteriorly and improves the
leverage of thigh muscles acting across
the knee. The foot includes the bones
of ankle, **the tarsus** , **the metatarsus**
and **the phalanges or toe bones**. The
foot supports our body weight and acts
as a lever to propel the body forward,
while walking and running. **The tarsus**
is made up of seven bones called tarsals.


The metatarsus consists of five bones
called metatarsals. The arrangement of
the metatarsals is parallel to each other.
There are 14 phalanges in the toes which
are smaller than those of the fingers.


Structure of a typical long bone
A typical long bone has a diaphysis ,
epiphyses (singular-epiphysis) and
membranes (Figure 
##### 9.10). A tubular
diaphysis or shaft, forms the long axis of
the bone. It is constructed of a thick collar
of compact bone that surrounds a central
medullary cavity or marrow cavity. The
epiphyses are the bone ends. Compact bone
forms the exterior of epiphyses and their
interior contains spongy bone with red
marrow. The region where the diaphysis and
epiphyses meet is called the metaphysis. The
external surface of the entire bone except
the joint surface is covered by a double-
layered membrane called the periosteum.
The outer fibrous layer is dense irregular
connective tissue. The inner osteogenic
layer consists of osteoblasts (bone- forming
cells) which secrete bone matrix elements
and osteoclasts (bone-destroying cells).
In addition, there are primitive stem
cells, osteogenic cells, that give rise to
the osteoblasts. The periosteum is richly
supplied with nerve fibres, lymphatic vessels
and blood vessels. Internal bone surfaces
are covered with a delicate connective tissue
membrane called the endosteum. The
endosteum covers the trabeculae of spongy
bone and lines the canals that pass through
the compact bone. It also contains both
osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Between the
epiphysis and diaphysis epiphyseal plate or
growth plate is present.

#### ##### 9.10 Types of joints**

Joints are essential for all types of movements

performed by the bony parts of the body.

The joints are points of contact (Figure 
##### 9.11)

between bones.


Sometimes they are playing a protective

role in the process. Force generated by the

muscles are used to carry out the movement

through joints which helps human functional

activity of daily living and ambulation. The

joint acts as a fulcrum of a lever.

(i) **Fibrous joints or Synarthroses:** They


are immovable fixed joints in which no
movement between the bones is possible.
Sutures of the flat skull bones are fibrous
joints.


(ii) Cartilaginous joints or Amphiarthroses:
They are slightly movable joints in which
the joint surfaces are separated by a
cartilage and slight movement is only
possible. E.g., Joints of adjacent vertebrae
of the vertebral column.


(iii) Synovial joints or Diarthroses
joints: They are freely movable joints,
the articulating bones are seperated by a
cavity which is filled with synovial fluid.

An exhausted student was attending a
lecture. After 30 minutes or so, he lost
interest and he let go with a tremendous
yawn. To his great distress he couldn’t close
his mouth –his lower jaw was locked open.
What do you think would have caused it?

#### ##### 9.11 Disorders of muscular**

**and skeletal system**

**(a) Disorders of muscular
system**

**Myasthenia gravis:** An
autoimmune disorder
affecting the action
of acetylcholine at
neuromuscular junction leading to fatigue,
weakening and paralysis of skeletal
muscles. Acetylcholine receptors on the
sarcolemma are blocked by antibodies
leading to weakness of muscles. When the
disease progresses, it can make chewing,
swallowing, talking and even breathing
difficult.

**Tetany:** Rapid muscle spasms occur
in the muscles due to deficiency of
parathyroid hormone resulting in reduced
calcium levels in the body.

**Muscle fatigue:** Muscle fatigue is
the inability of a muscle to contract after
repeated muscle contractions. This is due
to lack of ATP and accumulation of lactic
acid by anaerobic breakdown of glucose

**Atrophy:** A decline or cessation of
muscular activity results in the condition
called atrophy which results in the
reduction in the size of the muscle and
makes the muscle to become weak, which
occurs with lack of usage as in chronic
bedridden patients.


Muscle pull: Muscle pull is actually
a muscle tear. A traumatic pulling of the
fibres produces a tear known as sprain.
This can occur due to sudden stretching
of muscle beyond the point of elasticity.
Back pain is a common problem caused by
muscle pull due to improper posture with
static sitting for long hours.
Muscular dystrophy: The group of
diseases collectively called the muscular
dystrophy are associated with the progressive
degeneration and weakening of skeletal
muscle fibres, leading to death from lung
or heart failure. The most common form
of muscular dystrophy is called Duchene
Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).
b) Disorders of skeletal system
Arthritis and osteoporosis are the major
disorders of skeletal system.

**1. Arthritis:** Arthritis is an inflammatory
    (or) degenerative disease that damages the
    joints. There are several types of arthritis.
    **(i) Osteoarthritis:** The bone ends of the
       knees and other freely movable joints
       wear away as a person ages. The joints
       of knees, hip, fingers and vertebral
       column are affected.
    **(ii) Rheumatoid arthritis:** The synovial
       membranes become inflamed and
       there is an accumulation of fluid in
       the joints. The joints swell and become
       extremely painful. It can begin at any
       age but symptoms usually emerge
       before the age of fifty.
    **(iii) Gouty arthritis or gout:** Inflammation
       of joints due to accumulation of uric
       acid crystals or inability to excrete it.
       It gets deposited in synovial joints.

**2. Osteoporosis:** It occurs due to deficiency
    of vitamin D and hormonal imbalance. The
    bone becomes soft and fragile. It causes
    rickets in children and osteomalacia in
    adult females. It can be minimized with
    adequate calcium intake, vitamin D
    intake and regular physical activities.

#### ##### 9.12 Benefits of regular**

**Exercise**

Exercise and physical activity fall into four
basic categories. Endurance, Strength,
Balance and Flexibility.

**Endurance** or aerobic activities
increase the breathing and heart rate.
They keep the circulatory system healthy
and improve overall fitness.

**Strength exercises** make the muscles
stronger. They help to stay independent
and carry out everyday activities such as
climbing stairs and carrying bags.

**Balance exercises** help to prevent
falls which is a common problem in older
adults. Many strengthening exercises also
improves balance.

**Flexibility exercises** help to stretch
body muscles for more freedom of joint
movements. Regular exercises can produce
the following beneficial physiological
changes:

- The muscles used in exercise grow
    larger and stronger.
- The resting heart rate goes down.
- More enzymes are synthesized in the
    muscle fibre.
- Ligaments and tendons become stronger.
- Joints become more flexible.
- Protection from heart attack.
- Influences hormonal activity.
    - Improves cognitive functions.
    - Prevents Obesity.
    - Promotes confidence, esteem.
    - Aesthetically better with good physique.
    - Over all well-being with good quality
       of life.
    - Prevents depression, stress and anxiety.
       During muscular exercise, there is an
    increase in metabolism. The O 2 need of the
    muscles is increased. This requirement is
    met with more oxygen rich RBCs available
    to the active sites. There is an increase
    in heart rate and cardiac output. Along
    with balanced diet, physical activity plays
    a significant role in strengthening the
    muscles and bones.
    **Summary**
    Movement is one of the significant features
    of living organisms. The different types
    of movements are amoeboid movement,
    ciliary movement, flagellar movement
    and muscular movement. Three types of
    muscles are present in human beings. They
    are the skeletal muscle, visceral muscle
    and cardiac muscle. The skeletal muscles
    are attached to the bones by tendons.
    The most striking microscopic feature of
    skeletal muscle is a series of light and dark
    bands. The muscles exhibit the properties
    such as excitability, contractibility,
    conductibility and elasticity. There are
    two types of muscle contraction. They are
    isotonic and isometric contractions.
    The skeletal system consists of a frame
    work of bones and cartilages. The skeletal
    system is grouped into two principal
    divisions: the axial skeleton and the
    appendicular skeleton. There are three
    types of joints present in the body: fibrous,
    cartilaginous and synovial joints.

The disorders related to muscular system
are myasthenia gravis, muscular dystrophy,
tetany, muscle fatigue, muscle pull,
atrophy and rigor mortis. The disorders
of the skeletal system are arthritis and
osteoporosis. Regular body exercise keeps
