##### Chapter Outline

**2.1 Classification of Plants**

2.2 Life Cycle patterns in Plants

2.3 Algae

2.4 Bryophytes

2.5 Pteridophytes

2.6 Gymnosperms

2.7 Angiosperms**

Traditionally organisms existing on the
earth were classified into plants and
animals based on nutrition, locomotion and
presence or absence of cell wall. Bacteria,
Fungi, Algae, Bryophytes, Pteridophytes,
Gymnosperms and Angiosperms were
included under plant group. Recently,with the aid of molecular characteristics.
Bacteria and Fungi were segregated
and placed under separate kingdoms.
Botany is one of the oldest science in the
world because its origin was from time
immemorial as early men explored and
identified plants for the needs of food,
clothing, medicine, shelter etc., Plants are
unique living entities as they are endowed
with the power to harvest the light energy
from the sun and to convert it to chemical
energy in the form of food through the
astounding reaction, **photosynthesis**. They
not only supply nutrients to all living things
on earth but sequester carbon-di-oxide
during photosynthesis, thus minimizing
the effect of one of the major green house
gases that increase the global temperature.
Plants are diverse in nature, ranging
from microscopic algae to macroscopic
highly developed angiosperms. There are
mysteries and wonders in the plant world
in terms of size, shape, habit, habitat,
reproduction etc., Although plants are all
made up of cells there exists high diversity
in form and structure (Table 2.1).

##### 2.1 Classification of Plants

Classification widely accepted for plants
now include Embryophyta which is divided
into Bryophyta and Tracheophyta. The
latter is further ­divided into Pteridophyta
and Spermatophyta (Gymnospermae and
Angiospermae). An outline Classification of
Plant Kingdom is given in Figure 2.1


![Plant-kingdom](/books/biology/unit-1/plant-kingdom/Fig2.1.eng.png )

##### 2.2 Life Cycle Patterns in Plants

**Alternation of Generation**

Alternation of generation is common
in all plants. Alternation of the haploid
gametophytic phase (n) with diploid
sporophytic phase (2n) during the life
cycle is called alternation of generation.
Following type of life cycles are found in
plants (Figure 2.2).


![Plant-kingdom](/books/biology/unit-1/plant-kingdom/Fig2.2.eng.png )


#### Haplontic Life Cycle

Gametophytic phase is dominant,
photosynthetic
and
independent,
whereas sporophytic phase is represented
by the zygote. Zygote undergoes meiosis
to restore haploid condition. Example:
*Volvox*, *Spirogyra*.

##### Diplontic Life Cycle

Sporophytic phase (2n) is dominant,
photosynthetic and independent. The
gametophytic phase is represented by
the single to few celled gametophyte.
The gametes fuse to form zygote which
develops into sporophyte. Example:
*Fucus*, gymnosperms and angiosperms

##### Haplodiplontic Life Cycle

his type of life cycle is found in bryophytes
and pteridophytes which is intermediate
between haplontic and diplontic type. Both
the phases are multicellular. but they differ
in their dominant phase.
In bryophytes dominant independent
phase is gametophyte and it alternates with
short-lived multicellular sporophyte totally
or partially dependent on the gametophyte.
In pteridophytes sporophyte is the
independent phase. It alternates with
multicellular saprophytic or autotrophic,
independent, short lived gametophyte(n)

##### 2.3 Algae


![Plant-kingdom](/books/biology/unit-1/plant-kingdom/Fig2.2x.eng.png )


Rain brings joy
and life to various
organisms on earth.
Have you noticed
some changes in
and around you after the rain? Could you
identify the reason for the slippery nature of
the terrace and green patches on the wall of our
home, green colour of puddles and ponds? Why
should we clean our water tanks very often?
The reason is algae. Algae are simple plants
that lack true roots, true stems and true leaves.
Two-third of our earth’s surface is covered by
oceans and seas. The photosynthetic plants
called algae are present here. More than half
of the total primary productivity of the world
depends on this plant group. Further, other
aquatic organisms also depend upon them for
their ­existence.



{{< box title="M.O.Parthasarathy,‘Father of Indian Phycology’" type="Author" >}}
He conducted research on
structure, cytology, reproduction
and taxonomy of Algae. He
published a Monograph on Volvocales. New
algal forms like *Fritschiella*, *Ecballocystopsis*,
*Charasiphon* and *Cylindrocapsopsis* were
reported by him.

![Plant-kingdom](/books/biology/unit-1/plant-kingdom/Fig2.2y.eng.png )

{{< /box >}}




Algae are autotrophs, and grow in a
wide range of habitats. Majority of them
are aquatic, marine (*Gracilaria*, and
*Sargassum*) and freshwater (*Oedogonium*, and
*Ulothrix*) and also found in soils (*Fritschiella*,
and *Vaucheria*). *Chlorella* lead an endozoic
life in hydra and sponges whereas *Cladophora*
*crispata* grow on the shells of molluscs. Algae
are adapted to thrive in harsh environment too.
Dunaliella *salina* grows in salt pans
(**Halophytic** **alga**). Algae growing in snow
are called **Cryophytic algae**. ­ Chlamydomonas
nivalis grow in snow covered mountains
and impart red colour to the snow (**Red**
**snow**). A few algae grow on the surface of
aquatic plants and are called **epiphytic algae**
(*Coleochaete, and Rhodymenia*). The study of
algae is called **algology** or **phycology**. Some
of the eminent algologists include F.E. Fritsch,
F.E. Round, R.E. Lee, M.O.Parthasarathy
Iyengar, M.S. Randhawa, Y. Bharadwaja, V.S.
Sundaralingam and T.V.Desikachary.


#### 2.3.1 General Characteristic features

The algae show a great diversity in size,
shape and structure. A wide range of
thallus organisation is found in algae.
Unicellular
motile
(*Chlamydomonas*),
unicellular non-motile (*Chlorella*), Colonial
motile (*Volvox*), Colonial non motile
(*Hydrodictyon*), ­
siphonous (*Vaucheria*),
unbranched
filamentous
(*Spirogyra*),
branched filamentous (*Cladophora*), discoid
(*Coleochaete*) heterotrichous (*Fritschiella*),
Foliaceous (*Ulva*) to giant kelps (*Laminaria*
and *Macrocystis*). The thallus organization
in algae is given in Figure 2.3.



Algae are eukaryotes except blue green
algae. The plant body does not show
differentiation into tissue systems. The cell
wall of algae is made up of cellulose and
hemicellulose. Siliceous walls are present in
diatoms. In *Chara* the thallus is encrusted
with calcium carbonate. Some algae possess
algin, polysulphate esters of polysaccharides
which are the sources for the a ­ lginate,
agar agar and carrageenan. The cell has a
membrane bound nucleus and cell organelles
like chloroplast, mitochondria, endoplasmic
reticulum, golgi bodies etc., Pyrenoids are
present. They are proteinaceous bodies
found in chromatophores and assist in
the synthesis and storage of starch. The
pigmentation, reserve food material and
flagellation differ among the algal groups.
Algae reproduces by vegetative, asexual
and sexual methods (Figure 2.4). Vegetative
reproduction includes fission (In unicellular
forms the cell divides mitotically to produce




![Plant-kingdom](/books/biology/unit-1/plant-kingdom/Fig2.3.eng.png )






![Plant-kingdom](/books/biology/unit-1/plant-kingdom/Fig2.4.eng.png )




two daughter cells Example: *Chlamydomonas*);
Fragmentation (fragments of parent thallus
grow into new individual Example: *Ulothrix*)
budding (A lateral bud is formed in some
members like *Protosiphon* and helps in
reproduction) bulbils, (a wedge shaped
modified branch develop in *Sphacelaria*)
akinetes (Thick walled spores meant for
perennation and germinates with the advent
of favourable condition Example: *Pithophora*)
and Tubers (Structures found on the rhizoids
and the lower nodes of *Chara* which store food
materials).

Asexual reproduction takes place by
the production of zoospores motile spores
(*Ulothrix, Oedogonium*) aplanospore (thin
walled non motile spores Example: *Vaucheria*);
autospores (spores which look similar to
parent cell Example: *Chlorella*); ­hypnospore
(thick walled aplanospore – Example:
*Chlamydomonas nivalis*) and Tetraspores
(Diploid thallus of *Polysiphonia* produce
haploid spores after meiosis).


Sexual reproduction in algae is of three
types 1. Isogamy (Fusion of morphologically
and Physiologically similar gametes Example:
*Ulothrix*) 2. Anisogamy (Fusion of either
morphologically or physiologically dissimilar
gametes Example: *Pandorina*) 3. Oogamy
(Fusion of both morphologically and
physiologically dissimilar gametes. Example:
*Sargassum*). The life cycle shows distinct
alternation of generation.

iron formations of northern Michigan
and dated to approximately 2100Ma

##### 2.3.2. Classification

F.E. Fritsch proposed a classification for
algae based on pigmentation, types of flagella,
reserve food materials, ­thallus structure and
reproduction. He published his classificationin the book “The ­structure and reproduction
of the ­
Algae”(1935). He classified algae
into 11 classes namely Chlorophyceae,
Xanthophyceae,
Chrysophyceae,
Bacillariophyceae,
Cryptophyceae,
Dinophyceae,
Chloromonadineae,
Euglenophyceae,
Phaeophyceae,
Rhodophyceae, Cyanophyceae.


The salient features of Chlorophyceae,
Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae are given
below.



**Chlorophyceae**

The members are commonly called ‘**Green**
**algae**’. Most of the species are aquatic(Fresh
water-*Spirogyra*, Marine -*Ulva*). A few are
terrestrial(*Trentipohlia*). Variation among the
shape of the chloroplast is found in members
of algae. It is cup shaped (*Chlamydomonas*),
discoid (*Chara*), girdle shaped, (*Ulothrix*),
reticulate (*Oedogonium*), ­
spiral (*Spirogyra*),
stellate (*Zygnema*) and plate like (*Mougeoutia*).


Chlorophyll ‘a’ and Chlorophyll ‘b’ are
the major photosynthetic pigments. Storage
bodies called pyrenoids are present in the
chloroplast and store starch. They also contain
proteins. The cell wall is made up of inner
layer of cellulose and outer layer of pectin.
Vegetative reproduction takes place by means
of fragmentation and asexual reproduction is
by the production of zoospores, aplanospores
and ­akinetes. Sexual reproduction is present
and may be isogamous, anisogamous or
oogamous. Examples for this group of algae
includes **Chlorella*, *Chlamydomonas*, ­*Volvox*,
*Spirogyra*, *Ulothrix*,* Chara* and *Ulva*.


**Phaeophyceae**


The members of this class are called ‘**Brown**
**algae**’. Majority of the forms are found in
marine habitats. *Pleurocladia* is a fresh water
form. The thallus is filamentous (*Ectocarpus*)
frond like (*Dictyota*)or may be giant kelps
(*Laminaria and Macrocystis*). The thallus is
differentiated into leaf like photosynthetic
part called fronds, a stalk like structure called
stipe and a holdfast which attach thallus to the
substratum.


The Pigments include Chlorophyll a, c,
Carotenoids and Xanthophylls. A golden
brown pigment called fucoxanthin is present
and it gives shades of colour from olive green
to brown to the algal members of this group.
Mannitol and Laminarin are the reserve food
materials. Motile reproductive structures
are present. Two laterally inserted unequal
flagella are present. Among these one is
whiplash and another is tinsel. Although
sexual reproduction ranges from isogamy to
oogamy, Most of the forms show oogamous
type. Alternation of generation is present
(isomorphic, heteromorphic or diplontic).
Examples for this group include *Sargassum*,
*Laminaria*, *Fucus* and *Dictyota*.



**Rhodophyceae**


Members of this group include ‘**Red algae**’ and
are mostly marine. The thallus is multicellular,macroscopic and diverse in form. *Porphyridium*
is the unicellular form. Filamentous
(*Goniotrichum*) ribbon like (*Porphyra*) are
also present. ­ *Corallina* and *Lithothamnion* are
heavily impregnated with lime and form coral
reefs. Apart from chlorophyll a, r-phycoerythrin
and r-phycocyanin are the photosynthetic
pigments. Asexual reproduction takes place
by means of monospores, neutral spores and
tetraspores.


The storage product is floridean starch.
Sexual reproduction is oogamous. Male sex
organ is spermatangium which produces
spermatium. Female sex organ is called
carpogonium. The spermatium is carried
by the water currents and fuse with egg
nucleus to form zygote. The zygote develops
into carpospores. Meiosis occurs during
carpospore formation. Alternation of
generation is present. Examples for this group
of algae include *Ceramium*, *Polysiphonia*,
*Gelidium*, *­Cryptonemia* and *Gigartina*.

**2.4 Bryophytes**

##### Amphibians of Plant Kingdom

In the previous chapter, we noticed a wide
range of thallus organization in Algae.
Majority of them are aquatic. The development
of heterotrichous habit, development
of parenchyma tissue and dichotomous
branching in some
algae supports the
view that colonization
of plants in land
occurred
in
the
past. Bryophytes are
simplest and most
primitive plant groups
descended from alga –
like ancestors. They are simple embryophytes.
Let us learn about the structure and
reproduction of these primitive land plants
called Bryophytes in detail.

![Plant-kingdom](/books/biology/unit-1/plant-kingdom/Fig2.4b.eng.png )

Bryophytes are simplest land inhabiting
cryptogams and are restricted to moist,
shady habitats. They lack vascular tissue and
hence called ‘**Non- vascular cryptogams**’.
They are also called as ‘**amphibians of**
**plant kingdom**’ because they need water for
completing their life cycle.



![Plant-kingdom](/books/biology/unit-1/plant-kingdom/Fig2.4c.eng.png )


##### 2.4.1 General characteristic features

• The plant body of bryophyte is
gametophyte and is not differentiated
into root, stem and leaf like structure.


• Most of them are primitive land dwellers.
Some of them are aquatic (*Riella*,
*Ricciocarpus*).


• The gametophyte is conspicuous, long
lived phase of the life cycle. Thalloid forms
are present in liverworts and Hornworts.
In Mosses leaf like, stem like structures
are present. In Liverworts thallus grows
prostrate on the ground and is attached
to the substratum by means of rhizoids.
Two types of rhizoids are present namely
smooth walled and pegged or tuberculate.
Multicellular scales are also present.
In Moss the plant body is erect with
central axis bearing leaf like expansions.
Multicellular rhizoids are present. The
structure and reproduction in Bryophytes
is given in Figure 2.5.


• Vascular tissue like xylem and phloem
are completely absent, hence called ‘Non
vascular cryptogams’.


• Vegetative reproduction takes place by
the formation of adventitious buds (*Riccia*
*fluitans*) tubers develop in *Anthoceros*. In
some forms small detachable branches
or brood bodies are formed, they help in
vegetative reproduction as in *Bryopteris*
*fruticulosa*. In *Marchantia* propagative
organs called gemmae are formed and
help in reproduction



![Plant-kingdom](/books/biology/unit-1/plant-kingdom/Fig2.5.eng.png )




• Sexual reproduction is oogamous.
Antheridia and Archegonia are
produced in a protective covering and
are multicellular.


• The antheridia produces biflagellate
antherozoids which swims in thin film
of water and reach the archegonium and
fuse with the egg to form diploid zygote.


• Water is essential for fertilization.


• The zygote is the first cell of the
sporophyte generation. It undergoes
mitotic division to form multicellular
undifferentiated embryo.
The
embryogeny is exoscopic (the first
division of the zygote is transverse and
the apex of the embryo develops from
the outer cell). The embryo divides and
give rise to sporophyte.


• The sporophyte is dependent on gametophyte


• It is differentiated into three
recognizable parts namely foot,seta and capsule.

• Foot is the basal portion
and is embedded in the
gametophyte through which
water and nutrients are
supplied for the sporophyte.
The diploid spore mother
cells found in the capsule
region undergoes meiotic
division and give rise to
haploid spores. Bryophytes
are homosporous. In some
sporophytes elaters are present
and help in dispersal of spores
(Example: *M­archantia)*. The
spores germinate to produce
gametophyte.

• The zygote, embryo and the
sporogonium constitute sporophytic
phase. The green long living haploid
phase is called gametophytic phase. The
haploid gametophytic phase alternates
with diploid sporophyte and shows
heterologous alternation of generation.


Proskauer in the year 1957 classified
Bryophytes into 3 Classes namely

i. **Hepaticopsida** (*Riccia*, *Marchantia*,
*Porella* and *Riella*)

ii. **Anthocerotopsida** (*Anthoceros* and
*Dendroceros*)

iii. **Bryopsida**
(*Funaria*, *Polytrichum* and
*Sphagnum*).






**2.4.2 Economic importance**

Dead thalli of *Sphagnum* gets accumulated
and compressed, hardened to form peat.
In northern Europe (Netherlands)peat is
used as fuel in commercial scale. Apart
from this nitrates, brown dye and tanning
materials are derived from peat. *Sphagnum*
and peat are also used in horticulture as
packing material because of their water
holding capacity. *Marchantia polymorpha*
is used to cure pulmonary tuberculosis.
*Sphagnum, Bryum* and *Polytrichum* are used
as food. Bryophytes play a major role in soil
formation through succession and help in
soil conservation.

**2.5 Pteridophytes**

##### Seedless Vascular Cryptogams

From the previous
section, we are
aware of the
salient features of
amphibious plants
called bryophytes.
But there is a
plant group called pteridophytes which are
considered as first true land plants. Further,
they were the first plants to acquire vascular
tissue namely xylem and phloem, hence
called vascular cryptogams. Club moss,
horsetails, quill worts, water ferns and tree
ferns belong to this group. This chapter
deals with the characteristic features of
Pteridophytes.

![Plant-kingdom](/books/biology/unit-1/plant-kingdom/Fig2.5a.eng.png )


Pteridophytes
are
the
vascular
cryptogams and were abundant in the
Devonian period of Palaeozoic era (400
million years ago). These plants are
mostly small, herbaceous and grow well in
moist, cool and shady places where water
is available. The photographs for some
pteridophytes are given in Figure 2.6.


![Plant-kingdom](/books/biology/unit-1/plant-kingdom/Fig2.6.eng.png )


**2.5.1 General characteristic features of Pteridophytes**:


• Plant body is sporophyte (2n) and it is the
dominant phase. It is differentiated into
root, stem and leaves.


• Roots are adventitious.


• Stem shows monopodial or dichotomous
branching.


• Leaves may be microphyllous or
megaphyllous.


• Stele is protostele but in some forms
siphonostele is present (*Marsilea*)


• Tracheids are the major water conducting
elements but in *Selaginella* vessels are
found.


• Sporangia, spore bearing bag like
structures are borne on special leaves
called sporophyll. The Sporophylls get
organized to form cone or strobilus.
Example: *Selaginella, Equisetum* .


• They may be **homosporous** (produce
one type of spores-*Lycopodium*) or
**Heterosporous** (produce two types of
spores-*Selaginella*). Heterospory is the
origin for seed habit.


• Development of sporangia may be
**eusporangiate**
(development
of
sporangium from group of initials)
or **leptosporangiate** (development of
sporangium from single initial)

• Spore mother cells undergo meiosis and
produce spores (n).


• Spore germinates to produce haploid,
multicellular green, cordate shaped
independent gametophytes called prothallus.


• Fragmentation, resting buds, root tubers
and adventitious buds help in vegetative
reproduction.


• Sexual reproduction is oogamous. Sex organs,
namely antheridium and archegonium are
produced on the ­prothallus.


• Antheridium produces spirally coiled
and multiflagellate antherozoids.


• Archegonium is flask shaped with broad
venter and elongated narrow neck. The
venter possesses egg or ovum and neck
contain neck canal cells.


• Water is essential for fertilization. After
fertilization a diploid zygote is formed
and undergoes mitotic division to form
embryo.


• Pteridophytes show **apogamy** and **apospory**

Reimer (1954) proposed a classification
for pteridophytes. In this classification,
the pteridophytes are divided into
five subdivisions. 1. Psilophytopsida
2. Psilotopsida 3. Lycopsida 4. Sphenopsida
5. Pteropsida. There are 19 orders and
48 families in the classification.



{{< box title="Do You Know?" type="objective" >}}
 The success and dominance
of vascular plants is due to
the development of

•Extensive root system.

•Efficient conducting tissues.

•Cuticle to prevent desiccation.

•Stomata for effective gaseous exchange

**2.5.3 Types of Stele**


The term stele refers to the central cylinder
of vascular tissues consisting of xylem,
phloem, pericycle and sometimes medullary
rays with pith (Figure 2.7).


![Plant-kingdom](/books/biology/unit-1/plant-kingdom/Fig2.7.eng.png )



There are two types of steles

1. Protostele		
2. Siphonostele


**1. Protostele:**

In protostele phloem surrounds xylem.
The type includes Haplostele, Actinostele,
Plectostele, and Mixed protostele.

(i) **Haplostele**: Xylem surrounded by phloem
is known as haplostele. Example: *Selaginella*.

(ii) **Actinostele**: Star shaped xylem core
is surrounded by phloem is known as
actinostele. Example: *Lycopodium serratum*.


(iii) **Plectostele**: Xylem plates alternates
with phloem plates. Example: *Lycopodium*
*clavatum*.


(iv) **Mixed prototostele**: Xylem groups
uniformly scattered in the phloem. Example:
*Lycopodium cernuum*.



**2. Siphonostele**:
In siphonostele xylem is surrounded by
phloem with pith at the centre. It includes
Ectophloic siphonostele, Amphiphloic
siphonostele,
­Solenostele,
Eustele,
Atactostele and Polycylic stele.


**(i) Ectophloic siphonostele**: The phloem
is restricted only on the external side of the
xylem. Pith is in centre. Example: ­ *Osmunda*.

**(ii) Amphiphloic siphonostele**: The phloem
is present on both the sides of xylem. The
pith is in the centre. Example: *Marsilea*.


**(iii) Solenostele**: The stele is perforated at a
place or places corresponding the origin of
the leaf trace.


**(a) Ectophloic solenostele** – Pith is in the
centre and the xylem is surrounded by
phloem Example *Osmunda*

**(b) Amphiphloic solenostele** – Pith is in
the centre and the phloem is present on
both sides of the xylem. Example: ­ *Adiantum*
*pedatum*.


**(c) Dictyostele** – The stele is separated
into several vascular strands and each one
is called meristele. Example: ­
*Adiantum capillus-veneris.*

**(iv) Eustele**: The stele is split into distinct
collateral vascular bundles around the pith.
Example: Dicot stem.


**(v) Atactostele**: The stele is split into distinct
collateral vascular bundles and are scattered
in the ground tissue. Example: Monocot
stem.


**(vi) Polycyclicstele**: The vascular tissues
are present in the form of two or more
concentric cylinders. Example: *Pteridium*



**2.6 Gymnosperms**

##### Naked seed producing Plants

Michael Crichton’s Science Fiction is a book
transformed into a Film of Steven Spielberg
(1993) called **Jurassic Park**. In this film you
might have noticed insects embedded in a
transparent substance called amber which
preserves the extinct forms. What is amber?
Which group of plants produces ­Amber?


![Plant-kingdom](/books/biology/unit-1/plant-kingdom/Fig2.7a.eng.png )



Amber is a plant secretion which is
an efficient preservative that doesn’t get
degraded and hence can preserve remains
of extinct life forms. The amber is produced
by **Pinites succinifera**, a Gymnosperm.


In this chapter we shall discuss in detail
about one group of seed producing plants
called **Gymnosperms**.


Gymnosperms (Gr. Gymnos = naked;
sperma= seed) are naked seed producing
plants. They were dominant in the Jurassic
and Cretaceous periods of Mesozoic era.
The members are distributed throughout
the temperate and tropical region of the world



##### 2.6.1 General characteristic features

• Most of the gymnosperms are evergreen,
woody trees or shrubs. Some are lianas
(*Gnetum)*


• The plant body is sporophyte and is
differentiated into root, stem and leaves.


• A well developed tap root system
is present. Coralloid roots of *Cycas*
have symbiotic association with blue
green algae. In *Pinus* the roots have
mycorrhizae.


• The stem is aerial, erect and branched or
unbranched (*Cycas*) with leaf scars.


• In conifers two types of branches namely
branches of limited growth (Dwarf
shoot) and Branches of unlimited growth
(Long shoot) is ­present.


• Leaves are dimorphic, foliage and scale
leaves are present. Foliage leaves are
green, photosynthetic and borne on
branches of limited growth. They show
xerophytic features.

• The xylem consists of tracheids but in
*Gnetum* and *Ephedra* vessels are ­present.


• Secondary growth is present. The wood
may be **Manoxylic** (Porous, soft, more
parenchyma with wide medullary ray
-*Cycas*) or **Pycnoxylic** (compact with
narrow medullary ray-*Pinus*).


• They are heterosporous. The plant may
be monoecious (*Pinus*) or dioecious *(Cycas*)


• Microsporangia and megasporangia
are produced on microsporophyll and
megasporophyll respectively.


• Male and female cones are produced.


• Anemophilous pollination is present.


• Fertilization is siphonogamous and
pollen tube helps in the transfer of male
nuclei.


• Polyembryony (presence of many
embryo) is present. The naked ovule
­develops into seed. The **endosperm** is
haploid and develop before fertilization.

• The life cycle shows alternation
generation. The sporophytic phase
dominant and gametophytic phase
highly reduced. The photograph
some of the gymnosperms is given in
Figure 2.8 

Sporne (1965) classified gymnosperms into
3 classes, 9 orders and 31 families. The classes
include i) Cycadospsida ii) Coniferopsida
iii) Gnetopsida.

##### 2.6.2 Comparison of Gymnosperm with Angiosperms

**Gymnosperms resemble with angiosperms**
**in the following features**


• Presence of well organised plant body
which is differentiated into roots, stem
and leaves.


• Presence of cambium in gymnosperms
as in dicotyledons.


• Flowers in Gnetum resemble the male
flower of the angiosperm. The zygote
represent the first cell of sporophyte.


• Presence of integument around the ovule.


• Both plant groups produce seeds.


• Pollen tube helps in the transfer of male
nucleus in both

• Presence of eustele

***Palaeobotany in India***

The National wood fossil park is situated in
Tiruvakkarai, a Village of Villupuram district
of Tamil Nadu. The park contains petrified
wood fossils approximately 20 million years
old. The term ‘form genera’ is used to name
the fossil plants because the whole plant is
not recovered as fossils instead organs or
parts of the extinct plants are obtained in
fragments. Shiwalik fossil park-Himachal
Pradesh, Mandla Fossil park-Madhya
Pradesh,
Rajmahal
Hills–Jharkhand,
Ariyalur – Tamilnadu are some of the fossil
rich sites of India.


Some of the fossil representatives of
different plant groups are given below


Fossil Algae - *Palaeoporella, Dimorphosiphon*


Fossil Bryophytes – *Naiadita, Hepaticites*,*Muscites*

Fossil Pteridophytes – *Cooksonia, Rhynia*,,
*Baragwanthia, Calamites*


Fossil Gymnosperms – **Medullosa*, *Lepido carpon, Williamsonia, Lepidodendron*


Fossil Angiosperms – *Archaeanthus, ­Furcula*

#### 2.7 Angiosperms

In the previous section,
the
characteristic
features of one of the
spermatophyte called
Gymnosperms
were

![Plant-kingdom](/books/biology/unit-1/plant-kingdom/Fig2.8b.eng.png )


discussed. Spermatophytes also include
plants bearing ovules enclosed in a protective
cover called ovary, such plants are called
Angiosperms. They constitute major plant
group of our earth and are adapted to the
terrestrial mode of life. This group of plants
appeared during the early cretaceous period
(140 million years ago) and dominates the
vegetation on a global scale. The sporophyte
is the dominant phase and gametophyte is
highly reduced.


##### **2.7.1 Salient features of Angiosperms**


• Vascular tissue (Xylem and Phloem) is
well developed.


• Flowers are produced instead of cone


• The Ovule remains enclosed in the ovary.


• Pollen tube helps in fertilization, so water
is not essential for fertilization.


• Double fertilization is present. The
endosperm is triploid.


• Angiosperms are broadly classified into
two classes namely Dicotyledons and
Monocotyledons.


##### **2.7.2 Characteristic features of Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons**


**Dicotyledons**


**Morphological features**


Reticulate venation is present in the leaves.
Presence of two cotyledons in the seed.
Primary root radicle persists as tap root.
Flowers tetramerous or pentamerous.
Tricolpate (3 furrow) pollen is present.

**Anatomical features**

• Vascular bundles are arranged in the form
of a ring in stem.


• Vascular bundles are open (Cambium
present).


• Secondary growth is present.



**Monocotyledons**

**Morphological features**


Parallel venation is present in the leaves.
Presence of single cotyledon in the seed. Radicle
doesn’t persist and fibrous root is present.
Flowers trimerous.
Monocolpate (1 furrow) Pollen is present.


**Anatomical features**
• Vascular bundles are scattered in the stem

• Vascular bundles are closed (Cambium
absent).

• Secondary growth is absent.

Current Angiosperm Phylogeny Group
(APG) System of classification doesn’t
recognize dicots as a monophyletic group.
Plants that are traditionally classified under
dicots are dispersed in several clades such as
early Magnolids and Eudicots.

#### Summary

Plant Kingdom includes Algae, Bryophytes,
Pteridophytes,
Gymnosperms
and
Angiosperms


The life cycle in plants fall under three types
1. Haplontic,2. Diplontic and 3. Haplodiplontic


Algae are autotrophic, chlorophyll
bearing organisms. The Plant body is
not differentiated into root like, stem
like or leaf like structures. A wide range
of thallus organization is found in algae.
They reproduce vegetatively through
fragmentation, tuber and akinete formation.
Zoospores, autospores and hypnospores
are produced during asexual reproduction
and sexual reproduction occurs through
isogamy, anisogamy and oogamy.


Bryophytes are the simplest land
plants. They are called amphibians of
plant kingdom or nonvascular cryptogams.
The plant body is gametophyte. The
sporophyte depends upon gametophyte.
Conducting tissues like xylem and phloem
is absent. Vegetative reproduction takes
place through fragmentation, formation
of adventitious bud and gemmae. Sexual
reproduction is oogamous. Water is
essential for fertilization.


Pteridophytes are also called vascular
cryptogams. The plant body is sporophyte
and is long lived, which is differentiated
into root, stem and leaves. They may
be homosporous or heterosporous.
The sporangia with spores are found in
sporophylls. The sporophylls organise
to form cones or strobilus. The spores
germinates to produce haploid, multicellular
heart shaped independent gametophyte
called prothallus. Sexual reproduction is
oogamous. The life cycle shows alternation
of generation.

The term stele includes central cylinder
of vascular tissues comprising xylem,
phloem, pericycle, endodermis and pith .
There are two major types of stele namely
protostele and siphonostele.

Gymnosperms are naked seed producing
plants. The plant body is sporophyte and it
is the dominant phase. Coralloid roots are
found in Cycas. The roots of Pinus possess
mycorrhizal association. Two types of
branches called long shoot and dwarf shoot
are present. Stem shows secondary growth.
Spores are produced in cones. Pollen tube
helps in fertilization. The endosperm is
haploid. Alternation of generation is present.


Angiosperms are highly evolved plant
group and their ovules remain enclosed in
an ovary. A wide range of habit is present.
These include trees, shrubs, herbs, climbers,
lianas. Double fertilization is present. The
endosperm is triploid. They are classified
into dicotyledons and monocotyledons.
