The study of various external features of the
organism is known as **Morphology**. **Plant**
**Morphology** is also known as **external**
**morphology** that deals with the study of
shape, size and structure of plants and their
parts (roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits and
seeds). Study of Morphology is important
in Taxonomy. Morphological features are
important in determining productivity of
crops. Morphological characters indicate the
specific habitats of living as well as the fossil
plants and help to correlate the distribution in
space and time of fossil plants. Morphological
features are also significant for phylogeny.



##### Plant Morphology can be studied under two broad categories

A. **Vegetative Morphology** – It includes
shoot system and root system

B. **Reproductive Morphology** – It includes
Flower/Inflorescence, Fruit and Seed

#### A. Vegetative morphology

**Vegetative morphology** deals with the study
of shape, size and structure of plants and their
parts like roots, stems and leaves. To understand
the vegetative morphology the following
important components are to be studied. They
are, 1) Habit, 2) Habitat and 3) Lifespan.

##### 3.1 Habit

The general form of a plant is referred as habit.
Based on habit, plants are classified into herbs,
shrubs, climbers (vines) and trees.

##### I. Herbs

Herbs are soft stemmed plants with less wood
or no wood. Example: *Phyllanthus amarus*,
*Cleome viscosa*. According to the duration of
their life they may be classified as **annuals**,
**biennials** and **perennials**. Perennial herbs
having a bulb, corm, rhizome or tuber as the
underground stem are termed as **geophytes**.
Example: *Allium cepa*


##### II. Shrubs

A shrub is a perennial, woody plant with
several main stems arising from the ground
level. Example: *Hibiscus rosa sinensis*
(shoe flower)



##### III. Climbers (Vine)

An elongated weak stem generally supported
by means of climbing devices are called
**Climbers** (vines) which may be annual or
perennial, herbaceous or woody.

**Liana** is a vine that is perennial and woody.
Liana’s are major components in the tree
canopy layer of some tropical forests. Example:
*Ventilago, Entada, Bougainvillea*.

##### IV. Trees

A tree is a stout, tall, perennial, woody plant
having one main stem called **trunk** with many
lateral branches. Example: Mango, Sapota, Jack,
Fig, Teak. If the trunk remains unbranched it is
said to be **caudex**. Example: Palmyra, Coconut.



##### 3.2 Plant habitat

Depending upon where plants grow habitats
may be classified into two major categories: I.Terrestrial and II.Aquatic.

##### I. Terrestrial 

Plants growing
terrestrial plants on land
are called **terrestrial plants**.

##### II. Aquatic

Plants that are living in water are called **aquatic**
**plants** or hydrophytes.


##### 3.3 Life Span

Based on life span plants are classified into 3
types. They are annuals, biennials and perennials

##### I. Annuals

A plant that completes its life cycle in one
growing season. Example: Maize, Water melon,
Groundnut, Rice.

##### II. Biennials

A plant that lives for two seasons, growing
vegetatively during the first season and
flowering and fruiting during the second
season. Example: Carrot, Radish, Cabbage.

##### III. Perennials

A plant that grows for many years that flowers
and set fruits for several seasons during the life
span. When they bear fruits every year, they
are called **polycarpic perennials**. Example:
Mango, Sapota. Some plants produce flowers
and fruits only once and die after a vegetative
growth of several years. These plants are called
**monocarpic perennials**. Example: *Bambusa*,
*Agave, Musa*.


##### 3.4 Parts of a flowering plant

Flowering plants are called “**Angiosperms**”
or **Magnoliophytes**. They are sporophytes
consisting of an axis with an underground
“**Root system**” and an aerial “**Shoot System**”.
The shoot system has a stem, branches and
leaves. The root system consists of root and its
lateral branches.




![vegetative-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/vegetative/Fig3.1.eng.png )


#### 3.5 Root System

The root is non-green, cylindrical descending
axis of the plant that usually grows into the
soil (positively geotropic). It develops from
the radicle which is the first structure that
comes out when a seed is placed in the soil.
Root is responsible for absorption of water and
nutrients and anchoring the plant.

##### I. Characteristic features

• Root is the descending portion of the plant
axis.

• Generally non-green in colour as it lacks
chlorophyll.


• Does not possess nodes, internodes and
buds (Exception in sweet potato and
members of Rutaceae, roots bear buds
which help in vegetative propagation)

• It bears root hairs (To absorb water and
minerals from the soil)


• It is positively geotropic and negatively
phototropic in nature.


##### II. Regions of root Root 

Root tip is covered by a dome shaped structure
made of parenchymatous cells called **root cap**.


![vegetative-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/vegetative/Fig3.2.eng.png )




It protects the meristematic cells in the apex. In
Pandanus multiple root cap is present. In Pistia
instead of root cap, root pocket is present. A few
millimeters above the root cap the following
three distinct zones have been classified based
on their meristematic activity.


1. Meristematic Zone
   
2. Zone of Elongation
   
3. Zone of Maturation



##### 3.5.1 Types of root system



![vegetative-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/vegetative/Fig3.3.eng.png )



##### I. Tap root system

Primary root is the direct prolongation of
the radicle. When the primary root persists
and continues to grow as in dicotyledons, it
forms the main root of the plant and is called
the **Tap root**. Tap root produces lateral roots
that further branches into finer roots. Lateral
roots along with the branches together called
as **secondary roots**.


##### II. Adventitious root system


Root developing from any part of  the plant other
than radicle is called **adventitious** root. It may
develop from the base of the stem or nodes or
internodes. Example: *Monstera deliciosa*, *Piper*
*nigrum*. In most of the monocots the primary
root of the seedling is short lived and lateral
roots arise from various regions of the plant
body. These are bunch of thread-like roots
nearly equal in size which are collectively called
**fibrous** root system generally found in grasses.
Example: *Oryza sativa, Eleusine coracana*.

##### 3.5.2 Functions of root


Root performs two kinds of functions namely
primary and secondary functions.


**Primary function**


1. Absorb water and minerals from soil.


2. Help to anchor the plant firmly in the soil.

**Secondary function**


In some plants roots perform additional
functions. These are called **secondary**
**functions**. To perform additional functions,
structure of roots are modified.


##### 3.5.3 Modifications of root


##### I. Tap root modification


##### a. Storage roots


**1. Conical Root**


These are cone like, broad at the base
and gradually tapering towards the apex.
Example: *Daucus carota*.

**2. Fusiform Root**


These roots are swollen in the middle and
tapering towards both ends. Example:
*Raphanus sativus*


**3. Napiform Root**


It is very broad at the apex and suddenly tapers
like a tail at the base. Example: *Beta vulgaris*




![vegetative-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/vegetative/Fig3.4.eng.png )


##### b. Breathing root

Some mangrove plants like **Avicennia**,
**Rhizophora**, **Bruguiera** develop special kinds
of roots (Negatively geotropic) for respiration
because the soil becomes saturated with water
and aeration is very poor. They have a number
of breathing pores on pneumatophores for
exchange of gases.

##### II. Adventitious root modification


##### a. Storage roots


**1. Tuberous root**


These roots are swollen without any definite
shape. Tuberous roots are produced singly and
not in clusters. Example: *Ipomoea batatas*.


**2. Fasciculated root**


These roots are in cluster from the base of the
stem Example: *Dahlia, Asparagus*.


**3. Nodulose root**


In this type of roots, swelling occurs only
near the tips. Example: *Maranta* (Arrow root)
*Curcuma amada* (Mango ginger), *Curcuma*
*longa* (Turmeric)


**4. Moniliform or Beaded root**


These roots swell at frequent intervals giving
them a beaded appearance. Example: *Vitis*,
*Portulaca, Momordica*.


**5. Annulated root**

These roots have a series of ring- like swelling
on their surface at regular intervals. Example:
*Psychotria* (Ipecac)

##### b. Mechanical support


**1. Prop (Pillar) root**


These roots grow vertically downward from
the lateral branches into the soil. Example: *Ficus*
*benghalensis* (banyan tree), Indian rubber.


**2. Stilt (Brace) root**


These are thick roots growing obliquely
from the basal nodes of the main stem.
These provide mechanical
support. Example: *Saccharum officinarum*,
*Zea mays, Pandanus and Rhizophora*.


**3.Climbing (clinging) roots**


These roots are produced from the nodes
of the stem which attach themselves to the
support and help in climbing. To ensure a
foothold on the support they secrete a sticky
juice which dries up in air, attaching the roots
to the support. Example: *Piper betel*.


**4. Buttress root**

In certain trees broad plank like outgrowths
develop towards the base all around the trunk.
They grow obliquely downwards and give
support to huge trunks of trees. This is an
adaptation for tall rain forest trees. Example:
*Bombax ceiba* (Red silk cotton tree), *Ceiba*
*pentandra *(white silk cotton tree), *Delonix*
*regia, Bombax*. 


![vegetative-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/vegetative/Fig3.5.eng.png )





![vegetative-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/vegetative/Fig3.6.eng.png )



##### c. Vital functions

**1. Epiphytic or velamen root**


Some epiphytic orchids develop a special kind
of aerial roots which hang freely in the air.
These roots develop a spongy tissue called
**velamen** which helps in absorption of moisture
from the surrounding air. Example: *Vanda,Dendrobium*.


**2. Foliar root**

Roots are produced from the veins or lamina
of the leaf for the formation of new plant.
Example: *Bryophyllum, Begonia*.


**3. Sucking or Haustorial roots**


These roots are found in parasitic plants.
Parasites develop adventitious roots from stem
which penetrate into the tissue of host plant
and suck nutrients.


Example: *Cuscuta* (dodder), *Cassytha*,
*Orobanche* (broomrape), *Viscum* (mistletoe),
*Dendrophthoe*.

**4. Photosynthetic or assimilatory roots**


Roots of some climbing or epiphytic plants
develop chlorophyll and turn green which help
in photosynthesis. Example: *Tinospora, Trapa*
*natans* (water chestnut), *Taeniophyllum*.


##### 3.6 Shoot system


The plumule of the embryo of a germinating
seed grows into stem. The epicotyl elongates
after embryo growth into the axis (the stem)
that bears leaves from its tip, which contain the
actively dividing cells of the shoot called **apical**
**meristem**. Further cell divisions and growth
result in the formation of mass of tissue called
**a leaf primordium**. The point from which the
leaf arises is called **node**. The region between
two adjacent nodes is called **internode**.


##### I. Characteristic features of the stem

1. The stem is aerial, green, photosynthetic
and has nodes and internodes.


2. It is positively phototropic and negatively
geotropic.


3. It has nodes and internodes.


4. Stem bears vegetative bud for vegetative
growth of the plant, and floral buds for
reproduction, and ends in a terminal bud.


5. The young stem is green and thus carries
out photosynthesis


6. During reproductive growth stem bears
flowers and fruits.


7. Branches arise exogenously


8. Some stems bears multicellular hairs of  different kinds.


##### II. Functions of the stem


**Primary functions**


1. It provides support and bears leaves,
flowers and fruits.


2. It transports water and mineral nutrients to
other parts from the root.


3. It transports food prepared by leaves to
   other parts of the plant body.


**Secondary functions**

**1. Food storage**- Example: *Solanum*
*tuberosum, Colocasia and Zingiber officinale*

**2. Perennation / reproduction** – Example:
*Zingiber officinale, Curcuma longa*

**3. Water storage** – Example: *Opuntia*


**4. Bouyancy** – Example: *Neptunia*


![vegetative-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/vegetative/Fig3.7.eng.png )



**5. Photosynthesis** – Example: *Opuntia*,
*Ruscus, Euphorbia*.


**6. Protection**–Example:*Citrus*,
*Bougainvillea, Acacia*.


**7. Support** - Example: *Passiflora, Vitis, Cissus*
*quadrangularis*.


##### 3.6.1 Buds

Buds are the growing points surrounded by
protective scale leaves. The bud primordium
matures into bud. They have compressed axis
in which the internodes are not elongated
and the young leaves are closed and crowded.
When these buds develop, the internodes
elongate and the leaves spread out. Buds have
architecture identical to the original shoot and
develop into lateral branches or may terminate
by developing into a flower or inflorescence.
Based on origin, buds are classified into
(a) Terminal or Apical bud (b) Lateral or
Axillary or Axil bud. Based on function buds
are classified into (a) Vegetative bud (b) Floral
or Reproductive bud.


**1. Terminal bud or apical bud**: These buds
are present at the apex of the main stem
and at the tips of the branches.


**2. Lateral bud or Axillary bud**: These buds
occur in the axil of the leaves and develop
into a branch or flower.


**3. Extra axillary bud** : These buds are formed
at nodes but outside the axil of the leaf as in
*Solanum americanum*.


**4. Accessory Bud**: An extra bud on either side
(collateral bud) or above (superposed bud
or serial bud) the axillary bud. Example:
*Citrus and Duranta*.


**5. Adventitious buds**: Buds arising at
any part other than stem are known as
**adventitious buds**. Radical buds are those
that arises from the lateral roots which
grow into plantlets. Example: *Millingtonia*,
*Bergera koenigii *(*Murraya koenigii*),
*Coffea arabica* and *Aegle marmelos*.
**Foliar buds** are those that grow on leaves
from veins or from margins of the leaves.
Example: *Begonia *(Elephant ear plant) and
*Bryophyllum* (Sprout leaf plant). **Cauline**
**buds** arise directly from the stem either
from cut, pruned ends or from branches.
Adventitious buds function as propagules
which are produced on the stem as tuberous
structures. Example: *Dioscorea, Agave*.


6. **Bulbils (or specialized buds)** : Bulbils
are modified and enlarged bud, meant for
propagation. When bulbils detach from
parent plant and fall on the ground, they
germinate into new plants and serve as a
means of vegetative propagation. Example
*Agave* and *Allium proliferum*.

##### 3.6.2 Types of Stem


Majority of angiosperm possess upright,
vertically growing erect stem. They may
be many types they are (i) Excurrent,
(ii) Decurrent, (iii) Caudex and (iv) Culm.


**i. Excurrent**


The main axis shows continuous growth and
the lateral branches gradually becoming shorter
towards the apex which gives a conical
appearance to the trees. Example: Monoon
*longifolium*(*Polyalthia longifolia*), *Casuarina*.


**ii. Decurrent**


The growth of lateral branch is more
vigorous than that of main axis. The tree
has a rounded or spreading appearance.
Example: *Mangifera indica*.


**iii. Caudex**


It is an unbranched, stout, cylindrical
stem, marked with scars of fallen leaves.
Example: *Cocos nucifera*.


**iv. Culm**


Erect stems with distinct nodes and usually
hollow internodes clasped by leaf sheaths.
Example: Majority of grasses including Bamboo.


##### 3.6.3 Modification of Stem


 **I. Aerial modification of stem**


**1. Creepers**


These are plants growing closer (horizontally)
to the ground and produce roots at each node.
Example: *Cynodon dactylon*, *Centella*.


**2. Trailers (Stragglers)**


It is a weak stem that spreads over the surface
of the ground without rooting at nodes. They
are divided into 3 types,


i. **Prostrate (Procumbent**): A stem that
grows flat on the ground. Example:
*Indigofera prostrata*.


ii. **Decumbent**: A stem that grows flat but
becomes erect during reproductive stage.
Example: *Tridax*.


iii. **Diffuse**: A trailing stem with spreading
branches. Example: *Boerhavia diffusa*.


**3. Climbers**


These plants have long weak stem and produce
special organs for attachment for climbing over
a support. Climbing helps to display the leaves
towards sunlight and to position the flower for
effective pollination.


**i. Root climbers**


Plants climbing with the help of adventitious
roots (arising from nodes) as in species of *Piper*
*betel*, *Piper nigrum*, *Pothos*.


ii. **Stem climbers (Twiners)**


These climbers lack specialised structure for
climbing and the stem itself coils around the
support. Example: *Ipomoea, Clitoria, Quisqualis*.


Stem climbers may coil around the support
either clockwise or anti-clockwise. Clockwise
coiling climbers are called **dextrose**. Example:
*Dioscorea alata*. Anti-clockwise coiling
climbers are called **sinistrose**. Example
*Dioscorea bulbifera*.

iii. **Hook climbers**


These plants produce specialized hook like
structures which are the modification of
various organs of the plant. In *Artabotrys*
inflorescence axis is modified into hook. In
*Calamus* (curved hook) leaf tip is modified
into hook. In *Bignonia unguis-cati* the leaflets
are modified into curved hook (figure: 3.17). In
*Hugonia* the axillary buds modified into hook.


iv. **Thorn climbers**
Climbing or reclining on the support with the
help of thorns as in *Bougainvillea* and *Carissa*.

v. **Lianas (woody stem climber)**


Woody perennial climbers found in tropical
forests are lianas. They twine themselves
around tall trees to get light. Example: *Hiptage*
*benghalensis, Bauhinia vahlii*.


vi. **Tendril climbers**


Tendrils are thread-like coiling structures
which help the plants in climbing. Tendrils
may be modifications of Stem – as in *Vitis*
and *Cissus quadrangularis*; Inflorescence axis
– *Antigonon*; Leaf – *Lathyrus*; Leaflets - *Pisum*
*sativum*; Petiole – *Clematis*; Leaftip – *Gloriosa*;
Stipules – *Smilax*. In pitcher plant (Nepenthes)
the midrib of the leaf often coils around a
support like a tendril and holds the pitcher in a
vertical position.


**4. Phylloclade**


This is a green, flattened cylindrical or angled
stem or branch of unlimited growth, consisting
of a series of nodes and internodes at long or
short intervals. Phylloclade is characteristic
adaptation of xerophytes where the leaves often
fall off early and modified into spines or scales
to reduce transpiration. The phylloclade takes
over all the functions of leaves, particularly
photosynthesis. The phylloclade is also called
as **cladophyll**. Example: *Opuntia*, *Phyllocactus*,
*Muehlenbeckia*
(flattened
phylloclade)
*Casuarina*, *Euphorbia tirucalli*, *Euphorbia*
*antiquorum* (cylindrical phylloclade).



![vegetative-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/vegetative/Fig3.8.eng.png )


5. **Cladode**
   
Cladode is a flattened or cylindrical stem
similar to Phylloclade but with one or two
internodes only. Their stem nature is evident by
the fact that they bear buds, scales and flowers.
Example: *Asparagus* (cylindrical cladode),
*Ruscus *(flattened cladode).

**6. Thorns**


Thorn is a woody and sharp pointed modified
stem. Either the axillary bud or the terminal
bud gets modified into thorns. In *Citrus* and
*Atalantia axillary* bud is modified into thorns.

##### II. Sub aerial stem modifications

Sub aerial stem found in plants with weak
stem in which branches lie horizontally on
the ground. These are meant for vegetative
propagation. They may be sub aerial or partially
sub terranean.


**1. Runner**


This is a slender, prostrate branch creeping on the
ground and rooting at the nodes. Example: *Oxalis*
(Wood sorrel), lawn grass (*Cynodon dactylon*).


2. **Stolon**


This is also a slender, lateral branch originating
from the base of the stem. But it first grows
obliquely above the ground, produces a loop
and bends down towards the ground. When
touches the ground it produces roots and
becomes an independent plantlet. Example:
*Mentha piperita* (peppermint), *Fragaria indica*
(wild strawberry)


![vegetative-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/vegetative/Fig3.9.eng.png )




3. **Sucker**


Sucker develops from an underground stem
and grows obliquely upwards and gives rise
New plant
to a separate plantlet or new plant. Example:
Root
*Chrysanthemum, Bambusa*.


4. **Offset**


Offset is similar to runner but found in aquatic
plants especially in rosette leaved forms. A
short thick lateral branch arises from the lower
Offset
axil and grows horizontally leafless for
a short
distance, then it produces a bunch of rosette
leaves and root at nodes. Example: *Eichhornia*
(water hyacinth), Pistia (water lettuce).





![vegetative-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/vegetative/Fig3.9c.eng.png )


##### III. Underground stem modifications


Perennial and some biennial herbs have
underground stems, which are generally
known as **root stocks**. Rootstock functions
as a storage and protective organ. It remains
alive below the ground during unfavourable
conditions and resumes growth during the
favourable conditions.


Underground stems are not roots because
they possess nodes, internodes, scale-leaves
and buds. Rootstock also lack root cap and
root hairs but they possess terminal bud which
is a characteristics of stem.


**1. Bulb**


It is a condensed conical or convex stem
surrounded by fleshy scale leaves. They are of
two types 1. Tunicated (coated) bulb: In which
the stem is much condensed and surrounded
by several concentric layers of scale leaves. The
inner scales commonly fleshy, the outer ones
dry. They can be classified into two types (a)
Simple Tunicated bulb Example: *Allium cepa*
(b) Compound Tunicated bulb. Example:
*Allium sativum*.


**2. Corm**


This is a succulent underground stem with an
erect growing tip. The corm is surrounded by
scale leaves and exhibit nodes and internodes.
Example:
*Amorphophallus*,
*Colocasia*,
*Colchicum*


![vegetative-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/vegetative/Fig3.10.eng.png )





**3. Rhizome**


This is an underground stem growing
horizontally with several lateral growing
tips. Rhizome posses conspicuous nodes and
internodes covered by scale leaves. Example:
*Zingiber officinale, Canna, Curcuma longa*,
*Musa*.


**4. Tuber**


This is a succulent underground spherical
or globose stem with many embedded
axillary buds called “**eyes**”. Example: *Solanum*
*tuberosum, Helianthus tuberosus*.


##### IV. Stem Branching


Branching pattern is determined by the
relative activity of apical meristems. The
mode of arrangement of branches on a stem
is known as **branching**. There are two main
types of branching, 1. Lateral branching and
2. Dichotomous branching. Based on growth
pattern stems may show indeterminate or
determinate growth.



1. **Indeterminate**: The terminal bud grows
uninterrupted and produce several
lateral branches. This type of growth is
also known as **monopodial branching**.
Example: *Polyalthia, Swietenia*.


2. **Determinate**: The terminal bud caese
to grow after a period of growth and the
further growth is taken care by successive
or several lateral meristem or buds.
This type of growth is also known as
**sympodial branching**. Example: *Cycas*.



##### 3.7 Leaf


Leaves are green, thin flattened lateral
outgrowths of the stem. Leaves are the primary
photosynthetic organs and the main site of
transpiration. All the leaves of a plant together
are referred to as **phyllome**.



##### I.Characteristics of leaf

1.Leaf is a lateral appendage of the stem.

2.It is borne at the node of the stem.

3.It is exogenous in origin.

4.It has limited growth.

5.It does not posses apical bud.

6.It has three main parts namely, leaf base,
petiole and lamina.

7.Lamina of the leaf is traversed by vascular
strands, called **veins**.


##### II. Functions of the leaf


**Primary functions**


1. Photosynthesis


2. Transpiration


3. Gaseous exchange


4. Protection of buds


5. Conduction of water and dissolved solutes.



**Secondary functions**


1. Storage – Example: *Aloe, Agave*.


2. Protection – Example: *Opuntia*, *Argemone*
*mexicana*.


3. Support – Example: Gloriosa, Nepenthes.


4. Reproduction - Example: *Bryophyllum*,
*Begonia, Zamia*.


##### 3.7.1 Parts of the leaf


Three main parts of a typical leaf are:

i. Leaf base (Hypopodium)


ii. Petiole (Mesopodium)


iii. Lamina (Epipodium)


##### I. Leaf base (hypopodium)


The part of the leaf attached to the node of the
stem is called **leaf base**. Usually it protects the
growing buds at its axil.


**Pulvinus**: In legumes leaf base become broad
and swollen which is known as **pulvinus**.
Example: *Clitoria, Lablab, Cassia, Butea*.


**Sheathing leafbase**: In many monocot families
such as Arecaceae, Musaceae, Zingiberaceae
and Poaceae the leafbase extends into a sheath
and clasps part or whole of the internode. Such
leafbase also leave permanent scars on the stem
when they fall.


##### II. Petiole (stipe or mesopodium)


It is the bridge between lamina and stem. Petiole
or leaf stalk is a cylindrical or sub cylindrical
or flattened structure of a leaf which joins the
lamina with the stem. A leaf with petiole are
said to be **petiolate**. Example: Ficus, Hibiscus.
Leaves that do not possess petiole is said to be
**sessile**. Example: *Calotropis*.





![vegetative-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/vegetative/Fig3.11.eng.png )




##### III. Lamina (Leaf blade)


The expanded flat green portion of the leaf is the
blade or lamina. It is the seat of photosynthesis,
gaseous exchange, transpiration and most
of the metabolic reactions of the plant. The
lamina is traversed by the midrib from which
arise numerous lateral veins and thin veinlets.
The lamina shows great variations in its shape,
margin, surface, texture, colour, venation and


**Stipules**


In most of the dicotyledonous plants, the
leaf base bears one or two lateral appendages
called the **stipules**. Leaves with stipules are
called **stipulate**. The leaves without stipules are
called **exstipulate** or **estipulate**. The stipules
are commonly found in dicotyledons. In some
grasses (Monocots) an additional out growth
is present between leaf base and lamina. It is
called **Ligule**. Sometimes, small stipule like
outgrowths are found at the base of leaflets of
a compound leaf. They are called **stipels**. The
main function of the stipule is to protect the
leaf in the bud condition.


##### 3.7.2 Venation


The arrangement of veins and veinlets on
the leaf blade or lamina is called **venation**.
Internally, the vein contains vascular tissues.
Conventionally venation is classified into two
types namely, Reticulate venation and Parallel
venation.


##### I. Reticulate venation


In this type of venation leaf contain a prominent
midrib from which several secondary veins
arise that branch and anastomose like a
network. This type of venation is common in
all dicot leaves. It is of two types.


1. **Pinnately reticulate venation (unicostate)**:
In this type of venation there is only
one midrib in the centre which forms
many lateral branches to form a network.
Example: *Mangifera indica*.


2. **Palmately reticulate venation (multicostate)**: In this type of venation
there are two or more principal veins
arising from a single point and they proceed
outwards or upwards. The two types of
palmate reticulate venation are






![vegetative-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/vegetative/Fig3.12.eng.png )



**i. Divergent type**: When all principal
veins originate from the base and
diverge from one another towards
the margin of the leaf as in *Carica*
*papaya*.


ii. **Convergent**: When the veins converge
to the apex of the leaf, as in Indian plum
(*Zizyphus*), bay leaf (*Cinnamomum*).


##### II. Parallel venation


Veins run parallel and do not form a prominent
reticulum. It is a characteristic feature of monocot
leaves. It is classified into two sub types.


1. **Pinnately Parallel Venation (Unicostate**)


When there is a prominent midrib in
the center, from which arise many veins
perpendicularly and run parallel to each
other. Example: *Musa, Zinger*.


2. **Palmate Parallel Venation (Multicostate)**


In this type several veins arise from the tip of the
petiole and they all run parallel to each other
and unite at the apex. It is of two sub types.


i. **Divergent type**: 

All principal veins
originate from the base and diverge
towards the margin, the margin of the leaf
as in fan palm (*Borassus flabelliformis*)


ii. **Convergent type**:

All principal veins run
parallel to each other from the base of the
lamina and join at the apex as in Bamboos,
rice, water hyacinth.



![vegetative-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/vegetative/Fig3.13.eng.png )


##### 3.7.3 Phyllotaxy

The mode of arrangement
of leaves on the stem is
known as **phyllotaxy** **(Gk**.
**Phyllon = leaf** ; **taxis =**
**arrangement**). Phyllotaxy
is to avoid over crowding of leaves and
expose the leaves maximum to the sunlight
for photosynthesis. The four main types of
phyllotaxy are (1) Alternate (2) Opposite (3)
Ternate (4) Whorled.


**1. Alternate phyllotaxy**


In this type there is only one leaf per node and
the leaves on the successive nodes are arranged
alternate to each other. Spiral arrangement
of leaves show vertical rows are called
**orthostichies**. They are of two types.


a) **Alternate spiral**: In which the leaves are
arranged alternatively in a spiral manner.
Example: *Hibiscus, Ficus*.


b) **Alternate distichous** or **Bifarious**: In which
the leaves are organized alternatively in two
rows on either side of the stem. Example:
*Monoon longifolium (Polyalthia longifolia)*.

**2. Opposite phyllotaxy**


In this type each node possess two leaves
opposite to each other. They are organized in
two different types.


i. **Opposite superposed**: The pair of leaves
arranged in succession are in the same
direction, that is two opposite leaves
at a node lie exactly above those at the
lower node. Example: *Psidium* (Guava),
*Quisqualis* (Rangoon creeper).

ii. **Opposite decussate**: In this type of
phyllotaxy one pair of leaves is placed at
right angles to the next upper or lower pair
of leaves. Example: *Calotropis, Ocimum*


**3. Ternate phyllotaxy**

In this type there are three leaves attached at
each node. Example: *Nerium*

**4. Whorled (verticillate) type of phyllotaxy**

In this type more than three leaves are present
in a whorl at each node forming a circle or
whorl. Example: *Allamanda*.


##### 3.7.4 Leaf mosaic

In leaf mosaic leaves tend to fit in with one
another and adjust themselves in such a
way that they may secure the maximum
amount of sunlight with minimum amount
of overlapping. The lower leaves have longer
petioles and successive upper leaves possess
shorter petioles. Example: *Acalypha*.


##### 3.7.5 Leaf type

The pattern of division of a leaf into discrete
components or segments is termed leaf type.
Based on the number of segments.


##### I. Simple leaf


A leaf is said to be simple when the petiole
bears a single lamina; lamina may be entire
(undivided) Example: Mango or incised to
any depth but not upto the midrib or petiole.
Example: *Cucurbita*.



![vegetative-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/vegetative/Fig3.14.eng.png )


##### II. Compound leaf


Compound leaf is one in which the main
rachis bears more than one lamina surface,
called **leaflets**. Compound leaves have evolved
to increase total lamina surface. There is one
axillary bud in the axil of the whole compound
leaf. The leaflets however, do not possess
axillary buds.


**1. Pinnately compound leaf**


A pinnately compound leaf is defined as one
in which the rachis, bears laterally a number
of leaflets, arranged alternately or in an
opposite manner, as in Tamarindus, *Cassia*.


i. **Unipinnate**: The rachis is simple and
unbranched which bears leaflets directly
on its sides in alternate or opposite manner.
Example: *Rose, Neem*. Unipinnate leaves
are of two types.

 a. when the leaflets are even in number,
 the leaf is said to be **paripinnate**.
Example: *Tamarindus*.

b. when the leaflets are odd in number,
the leaf is said to be **imparipinnate**.
Example: *Azadirachta* (Neem).


ii. **Bipinnate**: The primary rachis produces
secondary rachii which bear the leaflets.
The secondary rachii are known as **pinnae**.
Number of pinnae varies depending on
the species. Example: *Delonix*.

iii. **Tripinnate**: When the rachis branches
thrice the leaf is called **tripinnate**. (i.e) the
secondary rachii produce the tertiary rachii
which bear the leaflets. Example: *Moringa*.


iv. **Decompound**: When the rachis of leaf
is branched several times it is called
**decompound**. Example: *Daucus carota*,
*Coriandrum sativum*


**2. Palmately compound leaf**


A palmately compound leaf is defined as one
in which the petiole bears terminally, one or
more leaflets which seem to be radiating from
a common point like fingers from the palm.


i. **Unifoliolate**: When a single leaflet is
articulated to the petiole is said to be
unifoliolate. Example: *Citrus*.



![vegetative-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/vegetative/Fig3.15.eng.png )


![vegetative-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/vegetative/Fig3.16.eng.png )




**ii. Bifoliolate**: When there are two leaflets
articulated to the petiole it is said to be
bifoliolate. Example: *Zornia diphylla*


**iii. Trifoliolate**: There are three leaflets
articulated to the petiole it is said to be
trifoliolate. Example: wood apple (*Aegle*
*marmelos*), Clover (*Trifolium*).


**iv. Quadrifoliolate**: There are four leaflets
articulated to the petiole it is said to
be quadrifoliolate. Example: *Paris*
*quadrifolia, Marsilia*


**v. Multifoliolate or digitate**: Five or more
leaflets are joined and spread like fingers
from the palm, as in *Cleome pentaphylla*,
*Bombax ceiba*


##### 3.7.6 Modification of Leaf


The main function of the leaf is food
preparation by photosynthesis. Leaves
modified to perform some specialized
functions. They are described below.


##### I. Leaf tendrils


In some plants stem is very weak and
hence they have some special organs for
attachment to the support. So some leaves
are partially or wholly modified into tendril.
Tendril is a slender wiry coiled structure
which helps in climbing the support. Some
of the modification of leaf tendrils are given
below:


Entire leaf—*Lathyrus*, stipules—*Smilax*,
terminal leaflet—*Naravelia*, Leaf tip— *Gloriosa*,
Apical leaflet—*Pisum*, petiole— *Clematis*.


##### II. Leaf hooks


In some plants, leaves are modified into
hook-like structures and help the plant to
climb. In cat,s nail (*Bignonia unguis-cati*)
an elegant climber, the terminal leaflets
become modified into three, very sharp,
stiff and curved hooks, very much like the
nails of a cat. These hooks cling to the bark
of a tree and act as organs of support for
climbing. The leaf spines of *Asparagus* also
act as hooks.


![vegetative-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/vegetative/Fig3.17a.eng.png )



##### III. Leaf Spines and Prickles


Leaves of certain plants develop spinesent
structures. Either on the surface or on the
margins as an adaptation to herbivory
and xeric conditions. Example: *Zyzypus*
*Argemone mexicana* (Prickly poppy),
*Solanum trilobatum*. In xerophytes such as
*Opuntia* (Prickly pear) and *Euphorbia* leaves
and stipules are modified into spines.


Prickles are small, sharp structure which
are the outgrowths from epidermal cells of
stem or leaf. It helps the plant in scrambling
over other plants. It is also protective against
herbivory. Example: *Rosa spp*.


##### IV. Storage Leaves


Some plants of saline and xerophytic habitats
and members of the family Crassulaceae
commonly have fleshy or swollen leaves.
These succulent leaves store water, mucilage
or food material. Such storage leaves
resist desiccation. Example: *Aloe, Agave*,
*Bryophyllum*

##### V. Phyllode 


Phyllodes are flat, green-coloured leaf-
like modifications of petioles or rachis.
The leaflets or lamina of the leaf are highly
reduced or caducous. The phyllodes perform
photosynthesis and other functions of leaf.
Example: *Acacia auriculiformis* (Australian
Acacia), *Parkinsonia*.





![vegetative-morphology](/books/biology/unit-2/vegetative/Fig3.17.eng.png )






##### VI. Pitcher


The leaf becomes modified into a pitcher in
*Nepenthes* and *Sarracenia*. In *Nepenthes* the
basal part of the leaf is laminar and the midrib
continues as a coiled tendrillar structure.
The apical part of the leaf is modified into a
pitcher the mouth of the pitcher is closed by
a lid which is the modification of leaf apex.


##### VII. Bladder

In bladderwort (*Utricularia*), a rootless free-
floating or slightly submerged plant common
in many water bodies, the leaf is very much
segmented. Some of these segments are
modified to form ­bladder-like structures,
with a trap-door entrance that traps aquatic
animalcules.

##### VIII Floral leaves

Floral parts such as sepals, petals, stamens
and carpels are modified leaves. Sepals
and petals are leafy. They are protective
in function and considered non-essential
reproductive parts. Petals are usually
coloured which attract the insects for
pollination. Stamens are considered pollen
bearing microsporophylls and carpels are
ovule bearing megasporophylls.


##### 3.7.7 Leaf duration


Leaves may stay and function for few days
to many years, largely determined by the
adaptations to climatic conditions.


**Caducuous (Fagacious)**
Falling off soon after formation. Example:
*Opuntia*, *Cissus quadrangularis*.

**Deciduous**


Falling at the end of growing season so that
the plant (tree or shrub) is leafless in winter/
summer season. Example: *Maple, Plumeria*,
*Launea, Erythrina*.


**Evergreen**


Leaves persist throughout the year, falling
regularly so that tree is never leafless. Example:
*Mimusops, Calophyllum*.


**Marcescent**


Leaves not falling but withering on the plant as
in several members of Fagaceae.


#### Summary


Flowering plants consist of two major organ
systems: Underground root system and aerial
shoot system. Roots perform the functions of
anchoring and absorbing nutrients from the
soil. However some roots perform additional
functions for which they undergo various
modifications in shape, form and structure.
Tap root continue the growth from the radicle
which further branches into secondary roots.
Adventitious roots arise from different parts
of the plant other than radicle. Stem helps to
display the leaves to get maximum sunlight
and positioning flowers and fruits to attract
pollination and dispersal agents. Apart from
the normal functions the stems are modified
to perform various functions such as food
storage, perennation and protection. Leaves
are exogenous in origin and function as food
synthesizing and gaseous exchange sites. Some
leaves also perform additional functions for
which they are modified in their morphology
Leaves possess vascular tissues in the form of
veins which render support to the lamina and
help in transport of water, nutrients and food in
and out of leaves. Phyllotaxy is the arrangement
or distribution of leaves on the stem or its
branches in such a way that they receive
maximum sunlight to perform photosynthesis.
