Plants are the prime companions of human
beings in this universe. Plants are the
source of food, energy, shelter, clothing,
drugs, beverages, oxygen and the aesthetic
environment. Taxonomic activity of human
is not restricted to living organisms alone.
Human beings learn to identify, describe,
name and classify food, clothes, books,
games, vehicles and other objects that they
come across in their life. Every human being
thus is a taxonomist from the cradle to the
grave.

Taxonomy has witnessed various
phases in its early history to the present day
modernization. The need for knowledge
on plants had been realized since human
existence, a man started utilizing plants
for food, shelter and as curative agent for
ailments.

Theophrastus (372 – 287 BC), the
Greek Philosopher known as “**Father of**
**Botany**”. He named and described some 500
plants in his “*De Historia Plantarum*”. Later
Dioscorides (62 – 127 AD), Greek physician,
described and illustrated in his famous
“**Materia medica**” and described about 600
medicinal plants. From 16 th century onwards
Europe has witnessed a major developments
in the field of Taxonomy. Some of the key
contributors include Andrea Caesalpino, John
Ray, Tournefort, Jean Bauhin and Gaspard
Bauhin. Linnaeus ‘**Species Plantarum**' (1753)
laid strong foundation for the binomial
nomenclature.

Taxonomy is no more classical morphology
based discipline but become a dynamic
and transdisciplinary subject, making use
of many branches of botany such as Cell
Biology, Physiology, Biochemistry, Ecology,
Pharmacology and also Modern Biotechnology,
Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics. It
helps to understand biodiversity, wildlife,
forest management of natural resources for
sustainable use of plants and eco restoration.

##### 5.1 Taxonomy and Systematics

The word taxonomy is derived from Greek
words “**taxis**” (arrangement) and “**nomos**”
(rules or laws). Taxonomy is defined as
as “the science dealing with the study of
classification including the bases, principles,
rules and procedures”.

Simpson (1961) defined Systematics as,
“Scientific study of the kinds and diversity of
organisms and all relationships among them”.
Though there are two terms are used in an
interchangeable way, they differ from each
other.

##### 5.2 Taxonomic Hierarchy

Taxonomic hierarchy was introduced by
Carolus Linnaeus. It is the arrangement of
various taxonomic levels in descending order
starting from kingdom up to species.

**Differences between Taxonomy and Systematics**

| **Taxonomy** 	| **Systematics** 	|
|:---:	|:---:	|
| • Discipline of classifying organisms into<br>taxa 	| • Broad field of biology that studies the<br>diversification of species. 	|
| • Governs the practices of naming,<br>describing, identifying and specimen<br>preservation. 	| • Governs the evolutionary history and<br>phylogenetic relationship in addition to<br>taxonomy. 	|
| • Classification + Nomenclature =<br>Taxonomy 	| • Taxonomy + Phylogeny = Systematics 	|





**Species** is the lowest of classification and
shows the high level of similarities among the
organisms. For example, *Helianthus annuus*
and *Helianthus tuberosus*. These two species
differ in their morphology. Both of them are
herbs but *Helianthus tuberosus* is a perennial
herb.

**Genus** consists of multiple species which
have similar characters but differ from the
species of another genus. Example: *Helianthus*,
*Tridax*.

**Family** comprises a number of genera
which share some similarities among them.
Example: Asteraceae.

**Order** includes group of families which
show less similarities among them.

**Class** consists of group of orders which
share few similarities.

**Division** is the next level of classification
that consists of number of classes.

Example: Magnoliophyta.

**Kingdom** is the highest level or rank of the
classification. Example: Plantae




| **Rank** 	| **Ending** 	| **Example** 	|
|:---:	|:---:	|:---:	|
| Kingdom 	| - 	| Plantae 	|
| Phylum =<br>Division 	| -phyta 	| Magnoliophyta 	|
| Subphylum =<br>Sub division 	| -phytina 	| Magnoliophytina 	|
| Class 	| -opsida 	| Asteropsida 	|
| Sub class 	| -idea 	| Asteridea 	|
| order 	| -ales 	| Asterales 	|
| sub order 	| -ineae 	| Asterineae 	|
| Family 	| -aceae 	| Asteracea 	|
| Sub family 	| -oideae 	| Asteroideae 	|
| Tribe 	| -eae 	| Heliantheae 	|
| Genus 	| - 	| Helianthus 	|
| Sub genus 	| - 	| Helianthus subg.<br>Helianthus 	|
| Series 	| - 	| Helianthus ser.<br>Helianthus 	|
| Species 	| - 	| Helianthus annuus 	|









##### 5.3 Concept of species-Morphological,Biological and Phylogenetic

Species is the fundamental unit of taxonomic
classification. Species is a group of individual
organisms which have the following characters.

1. A population of organisms which closely
resemble each other more than the other
population.

2. They descend from a common ancestor.
3. In sexually reproducing organisms, they
interbreed freely in nature, producing
fertile offspring.

Species concepts can be classified into two
general groups. Concept emphasizing process
of evolution that maintains the species as a unit
and that can result in evolutionary divergence
and speciation. Another concept emphasises
the product of evolution in defining a species.

##### Types of Species

 There are different types of species and they are
as follows:

1. Process of evolution - Biological Species


2. Product of evolution - Morphological Species
and Phylogenetic Species  

##### Morphological Species (Taxonomic species)

When the individuals are similar to one
another in one or more features and different
from other such groups, they are called
**morphological species**

##### Biological Species (Isolation Species)

According to **Ernest Mayr** 1963,“ these are
groups of populations that interbreed and
are reproductively isolated from other such
groups in nature”.

##### Phylogenetic Species

This concept was developed by **Meglitsch**
(1954), **Simpson** (1961) and **Wiley** (1978).
Wiley defined phylogenetic species as “an
evolutionary species is a single lineage of
ancestor descendent populations which
maintains its identity from other such lineages
which has its own evolutionary tendencies
and historical fate”.

##### 5.4 International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN)

Assigning name for a plant is known as
**Nomenclature**. This is based on the rules
and recommendations of the International
Code of Botanical Nomenclature. ICBN
deals with the names of existing (living) and
extinct (fossil) organisms. The elementary
rule of naming of plants was first proposed by
**Linnaeus** in 1751 in his *Philosophia Botanica*.
In 1813 a detailed set of rules regarding plant
nomenclature was given by **A.P. de Candolle**
in his famous work “*Theorie elementaire*
*de la botanique*”. Then the present ICBN
was evolved by following the same rules
of **Linnaeus**, **A.P. de Candolle** and his son
**Alphonse de Candolle**.

{{< box title="" type="objective" >}}

ICBN due to specific reasons and in order to
separate plant kingdom from other organisms,
is redesignated as ICN. The International
Botanical Congress held in Melbourne in July
2011 brought this change. The ICN stands
for International Code of Nomenclature for
Algae, Fungi and Plants

{{< /box >}}

##### ICN Principles

International Code of Nomenclature is based
on the following six principles.

1. Botanical nomenclature is independent
of zoological and bacteriological
nomenclature.

2. Application of names of taxonomic group
is determined by means of nomenclatural
types.

3. Nomenclature of a taxonomic group is
based on priority of publication.

4. Each taxonomic group with a particular
circumscription, position and rank can
bear only one correct name.

5. Scientific names of taxonomic groups
are treated as Latin regardless of their
derivation.

6. The rules of nomenclature are retroactive
unless expressly limited.

##### Codes of Nomenclature

ICN has formulated a set of rules and
recommendations dealing with the botanical
name of plants. International Botanical
Congress is held at different places every six
years. Proposals for nomenclatural changes
and changes in rules are discussed and
implemented. Changes are published in their
website.


18 th International Botanical Congress
held in 2011at Melbourne, Australia made
the following major changes.


1. The code now permits electronic
publication of names of new taxa.

2. Latin diagnosis or description is not
mandatory and permits the use of English
or Latin for the publication of a new name
(Art-39).

3. “One fungus, one name” and “one fossil
one name” are important changes, the
concept of anamorph and teleomorph
(for fungi) and morphotaxa (for fossils)
have been eliminated. (Previously, sexual
and asexual stages of the fungus/ fossils
were provided with different names).


{{< box title="" type="objective" >}}

**Anamorph** – Asexual reproductive stage
of fungus.

**Teleomorph** – Sexual reproductive stage of
fungus.

{{< /box >}}

4. As an experiment with “registration of
names” new fungal descriptions require
the use of an identifier from a “recognized
repository”. There are two recognized
repositories **Index fungorum** and **Myco**
**Bank**.


19 th International Botanical Congress was
held in Shenzhen in China in 2017. Changes
accepted by International Botanical Congress
are yet to be published.


##### Vernacular names (Common names)

Vernacular names are known as **common**
**names**. They are very often descriptive and
poetic references to plants. Common name
refer to more than one plant or many plants
may have same common name. These names
are regional or local and are not universal.
Example: *Albizia amara* . L belongs to
*Mimosaceae* is called as *Usilai* in South
Tamilnadu and *Thurinji* in North Tamilnadu.


{{< box title="Activity" type="objective" >}}




Write common name and scientific name of
10 different plants around your home.

{{< /box >}}



##### Scientific Names / Botanical Names

Each and every taxon as per the ICN (species,
genus, family etc) can have only one correct
scientific name. Scientific name of a species
is always a binomial. These names are
universally applied. Example: *Oryza sativa L*.
is the scientific name of paddy.

##### Polynomial

Polynomial is a descriptive phrase of a plant.
Example: *Ranunculus calycibus retroflexis*
*pedunculis falcatis caule erecto folius*
*compositis*. It means butter cup with reflexed
sepals, curved flower stalks, erect stem and
compound leaves. Polynomial system of
naming a plant is replaced by a binomial
system by Linnaeus.

##### Binomial

Binomial nomenclature was first introduced
by **Gaspard Bauhin** and it was implemented
by **Carolus Linnaeus**. Scientific name of a
species consists of two words and according
to binomial nomenclature, the first one is
called **genus name** and second one is **specific**
**epithet**. Example: *Mangifera indica*. *Mangifera*
is a genus name and *indica* is specific epithet.
This system is in vogue even now.

##### Author citation

This refers to valid name of the taxa
accompanied by the author’s name who
published the name validly. Example: *Solanum*
*nigrum L*. There are two types of author
citation.

**Single author**: When a single author proposed
a valid name, the name of the author alone
is accompanied by his abbreviated name.
Example: *Pithecellobium cinereum* Benth.

**Multiple authors**: When two or more authors
are associated with a valid publication of name,
their names should be noted with the help of
Latin word et or &.

Example: *Delphinium viscosum* Hook. f. et
Thomson.


##### Standard form of author’s abbreviations has to be followed


| **Author** 	| **Standard form of<br>Abbreviation** 	|
|:---:	|:---:	|
| Linnaeus 	| L. 	|
| G.Bentham 	| Benth. 	|
| William Hooker 	| Hook. 	|
| Robert Brown 	| R.Br. 	|
| J.P.Lamarck 	| Lamk. 	|
| A.P.de Candolle 	| DC. 	|
| Wallich 	| Wall 	|
| Alphonse de Candolle 	| A. DC. 	|





##### 5.5 Taxonomic Aids

Taxonomic aids are the tools for the taxonomic
study. Some techniques, procedures and stored
information that are useful in identification
and classification of organisms are called
**taxonomical aids**. They are required in
almost all branches of biological studies for
their proper identification and for finding
their relationship with others. Some of the
taxonomical aids are keys, flora, revisions,
monograph, catalogues, herbarium, botanical
gardens etc.

##### Keys

Taxonomic keys are the tools for the
identification of unfamiliar plants. These
keys are based on characters which are stable
and reliable. The most common type of key is
a dichotomous key. It consists of a sequence
of two contrasting statements. A pair of
contrasting statements is known as **couplet**.
Each statement is known as **lead**. The plant
is correctly identified with keys by narrowing
down the characters found in plant.

Example:

1. a) Flowers cream-coloured; fruiting calyx
enclosing the berry
......Physalis

b) Flowers white or violet; fruiting calyx
not enclosing the berry
....2

2. a) Corolla rotate;
fruit a berry
.....Solanum

b) Corolla funnel-form or salver-form;
fruit a capsule:
....3

3. a) Radical leaves present; flowers in
racemes; fruits without prickles
...Nicotiana

b) Radical leaves
absent; flowers solitary; fruits with
prickles.....Datura

Another type of key for identification is
the **Polyclave** or **Multi-entry key**. It consists
of a list of numerous character states. The
user selects all states that match the specimen.
Polyclave keys are implemented by a computer
algorithm.

##### 5.6 Botanical Gardens

In true sense all gardens are not botanical
gardens. Botanical gardens are centres
for collection of plants in their various
stages of living. Gardens existed for
growing ornamental plants for aesthetic
value, religious and status reasons. The
famous “hanging gardens” of Babylon in
Mesopotamia is an example. For the purpose
of science and education the first garden was
maintained by **Theophrastus** in his public
lecture hall at Athens.

First modern botanical garden was
established by **Luca Ghini** (1490-1556) a
professor of Botany at Pisa, Italy in 1544.


Botanical garden contains special plant
collections such as cacti, succulent, green
house, shade house, tropical, alpine and
exotic plants. Worldwide there are about
1800 botanical gardens and arboreta.

**Role of Botanical Garden**: Botanical
Gardens play the following important roles.

1. Gardens with aesthetic value which attract
 a large number of visitors. For example,
the Great Banyan Tree (*Ficus benghalensis*)
in the Indian Botanical Garden at Kolkata.



![taxonomy and systematic botany](/books/biology/unit-2/taxonomy/Fig5.1.eng.png )


2. Gardens have a wide range of species and
supply taxonomic material for botanical
research.

3. Garden is used for self-instruction or
demonstration purposes.

4. It can integrate information of diverse
fields like Anatomy, Embryology, Phyto-
chemistry, Cytology, Physiology and
Ecology.

5. Act as a conservation centre for diversity,
rare and endangered species.

6. It offers annual list of available species
and a free exchange of seeds.

7. Botanical garden gives information about
method of propagation, sale of plant
material to the general public.


##### Royal Botanic garden, Kew- England


![taxonomy and systematic botany](/books/biology/unit-2/taxonomy/Fig5.2.eng.png )


Royal Botanic garden Kew- England is a
non- departmental public body in the United
Kingdom. It is the largest botanical garden in
the world, established in 1760, but officially
opened in the year 1841.

Plant collections include Aquatic garden,
Arboretum with 14,000 trees, Bonsai
collection, Cacti collection and Carnivorous
plant collection.

##### 5.7 Herbarium – Preparation and uses

Herbaria are store houses of preserved plant
collections. Plants are preserved in the form
of pressed and dried specimens mounted on
a sheet of paper. Herbaria act as a centre for
research and function as sources of material
for systematic work.

##### Preparation of herbarium Specimen

Herbarium Specimen is defined as a pressed
and dried plant sample that is permanently
glued or strapped to a sheet of paper along with
a documentation label.

Preparation of herbarium specimen
includes the following steps.

**1. Plant collection**: Field collection, Liquid
preserved collection, Living collection,
Collection for molecular studies.

**2. Documentation of field site data**


**3. Preparation of plant specimen**


**4. Mounting herbarium specimen**


**5. Herbarium labels**.


**6.  Protection of herbarium sheets against mold and insects**


##### Uses of Herbarium

1. Herbarium provides resource material
for systematic research and studies.

2. It is a place for orderly arrangement of
voucher specimens.

3. Voucher specimen serves as a reference
for comparing doubtful newly collected
fresh specimens.

4. Voucher specimens play a role in studies
like floristic diversity, environmental
assessment, ecological mechanisms and
survey of unexplored areas.

5. Herbarium provides opportunity for
documenting biodiversity and studies
related to the field of ecology and
conservation biology.

##### Kew Herbarium

Kew Garden is situated in South West
London that houses the “largest and
most diverse botanical and mycological
collections in the world” founded in the
year 1840. Living collection includes more
than 30,000 different kinds of plants. While
herbarium which is one of the largest in
the world has over seven million preserved
plant specimens. The library contains
more than 7,50,000 volumes and the
illustrations and also a collection of more
than 1,75,000 prints, books, photographs,
letters, manuscripts, periodicals, maps and
botanical illustrations.

##### 5.8 Classification of Plants

Imagine walking into a library and
looking for a Harry Potter story book.
As you walk into the library you notice
that it is under renovation and all the
books are scattered. Will it not be hard
to find the exact book you are looking
for? It might take hours. So you decide
to come the next day when all the books
are arranged according to the genres. One
rack for adventure, another for Detective,
Fantasy, Horror, Encyclopaedia and so
on. You automatically know Harry Potter
is in the fantasy section and it takes less
than ten minutes for you to find it. That
is because the books have been classified
and arranged according to a system.

Similarly there is a vast assemblage of
group of plants in the world. Is it possible
to study and understand all of these? No.
Since it is difficult to study all these plants
together, it is necessary to device some
means to make this possible.


Classification is essential to biology
because there is a vast diversity of
organisms to sort out and compare.
Unless they are organized into manageable
categories it will be difficult for
identification. Biological classifications are
the inventions of biologists based upon the
best evidence available. The scientific basis
for cataloguing and retrieving information
about the tremendous diversity of flora is
known as **classification**.


Classification paves way for the
arrangement of organisms into groups on the
basis of their similarities, dissimilarities and
relationships. The purpose of classification
is to provide a systematic arrangement




![taxonomy and systematic botany](/books/biology/unit-2/taxonomy/Fig5.3.eng.png )



expressing the relationship between the
organisms.
Taxonomists have assigned a method of
classifying organisms which are called ranks.
These taxonomical **ranks** are hierarchical.
The scheme of classification has to be flexible,
allowing newly discovered living organisms
to be added where they fit best.

##### 5.9 Need for Classification

• Understanding the classification of
organisms can give an insight into other
fields and has significant practical value.

• Classification helps us to know about
different taxa, their phylogenetic
relationship and exact position.

• It helps to train the students of plant
sciences with regard to the diversity of
organisms and their relationship with
other biological branches.

##### 5.10 Types of classification

Taxonomic entities are classified in three
ways. They are artificial classification,
natural classification and phylogenetic
classification.



##### 5.10.1 Artificial system of classification



| 24 classes recognized by Linnaeus in his<br>Species Plantarum (1753) on the basis of<br>stamens. 	|  	|  	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| **No.** 	| **Classes** 	| **Characters** 	|
| 1 	| Monandria 	| stamen one 	|
| 2 	| Diandria 	| stamens two 	|
| 3 	| Triandria 	| stamens three 	|
| 4 	| Tetrandria 	| stamens four 	|
| 5 	| Pentandria 	| stamens five 	|
|  	| up to 24 th class<br>Cryptogamia 	| flowerless plants 	|




**Carolus Linnaeus** (1707 -1778) was a great
Swedish Botanist and said to be the “**Father of Taxonomy**.” He outlined an artificial system
of classification in
“**Species Plantarum**”
in 1753, wherein he
listed and described
7,300 species and
arranged
in
24
classes mostly on
the basis of number,
union
(adhesion
and cohesion), length, and distribution of
stamens. The classes were further subdivided
on the basis of carpel characteristics into
orders. Hence the system of classification
is also known as **sexual system of**
**classification**.

![taxonomy and systematic botany](/books/biology/unit-2/taxonomy/Fig5.4.eng.png )


This system of classification though
artificial, was continued for more than
100 years after the death of Linnaeus, due to
its simplicity and easy way of identification
of plants.


However the system could not hold good
due to the following reasons.


1. Totally unrelated plants were kept in a
single group, whereas closely related plants
were placed in widely separated groups.
Example:


a. Zingiberaceae of monocotyledons and
Anacardiaceae of dicotyledonous were
placed under the class **Monandria**
since these possess single stamens.

b. *Prunus* was classified along with *Cactus*
because of the same number of stamens.

No attempts were made to classify plants
based on either natural or phylogenetic
relationships which exist among plant groups.

##### 5.10.2 Natural system

Botanists who came after Linnaeus realised
that no single character is more important
than the other characters. Accordingly an
approach to a natural system of classification
sprouted in France. The first scheme of
classification based on overall similarities
was presented by **Antoine Laurent de**
**Jessieu** in 1789.

**Bentham and Hooker system of classification**



![taxonomy and systematic botany](/books/biology/unit-2/taxonomy/Fig5.5.eng.png )

A widely followed natural system of
classification considered the best was
proposed by two English botanist **George**
**Bentham** (1800 – 1884) and **Joseph Dalton**
**Hooker** (1817–1911). The classification
was published in a three volume work
as “*Genera Plantarum*” (1862–1883)
describing 202 families and 7569 genera and
97,205 species. In this system the seeded
plants were classified into 3 major classes
such as Dicotyledonae, Gymnospermae and
Monocotyledonae.

**Class I Dicotyledonae**: Plants contain
two cotyledons in their seed, leaves with
reticulate venation, tap root system and
tetramerous or pentamerous flowers come
under this class. It includes three sub-
classes – **Polypetalae**, **Gamopetalae** and
**Monochlamydeae**.

**Sub-class 1**. Polypetalae: Plants with
free petals and dichlamydeous flowers come
under polypetalae. It is further divided into
three series – **Thalamiflorae**, **Disciflorae**
and **Calyciflorae**.

**Series (i) Thalamiflorae**: Plants having
flowers with dome or conical shaped
thalamus and superior ovary are included
in this series. It includes 6 orders and 34
families.


**Series (ii) Disciflorae**: Flowers having
prominent disc shaped thalamus with
superior ovary come under this series. It
includes 4 orders and 23 families.

**Series (iii) Calyciflorae**: It includes
plants having flowers with cup shaped
thalamus and with inferior or sometimes
with half inferior ovary. Calyciflorae
includes 5 orders and 27 families.


**Sub-class 2. Gamopetalae**: Plants with
united petals, which are either partially
or completely fused to one another
and dichlamydeous are placed under
Gamopetalae. It is further divided into
three series – Inferae, Heteromerae and
Bicarpellatae.

**Series (i) Inferae**: The flowers are
epigynous and with inferior ovary. Inferae
includes 3 orders and 9 families.

**Series (ii) Heteromerae**: The flowers are
hypogynous, superior ovary and with more
than two carpels. Heteromerae includes 3
orders and 12 families.




![taxonomy and systematic botany](/books/biology/unit-2/taxonomy/Fig5.6.eng.png )

**Series (iii) Bicarpellatae**: The flowers
are hypogynous, superior ovary and with
two carpels. Bicarpellatae includes 4 orders
and 24 families.


**Sub-class 3. Monochlamydeae**: Plants
with incomplete flowers either apetalous or
with undifferentiated calyx and corolla are
placed under Monochlamydeae. The sepals
and petals are not distinguished and they are
called **perianth**. Sometimes both the whorls
are absent. Monochlamydeae includes 8 series
and 36 families.


**Class II Gymnospermae**: Plants that
contain naked seeds come under this class.
Gymnospermae includes three families –
Gnetaceae, Coniferae and Cycadaceae.


**Class III Monocotyledonae**: Plants
contain only one cotyledon in their seed,
leaves with parallel venation, fibrous root
system and trimerous flowers come under
this class. The Monocotyledonae has 7 series
and 34 families.

The Bentham and Hooker system of
classification is still supposed to be the best
system of classification. It has been widely
practiced in colonial countries and herbaria
of those countries were organised based on
this system and is still used as a key for the
identification of plants in some herbaria of the
world due to the following reasons:

• Description of plants is quite accurate
and reliable, because it is mainly based on
personal studies from actual specimens
and not mere comparisons of known **facts**.


• As it is easy to follow, it is used as a key
for the identification of plants in several
herbaria of the world.

Though it is a natural system, this system
was not intended to be phylogenetic.


##### 5.10.3 Phylogenetic system of classification


The publication of the **Origin of Species**
(1859) by **Charles Darwin** has given stimulus
for the emergence of phylogenetic system of
classification.

**I Adolph Engler and Karl A Prantl system of classification**



![taxonomy and systematic botany](/books/biology/unit-2/taxonomy/Fig5.7.eng.png )

One of the earliest phylogenetic system of
classification of the entire plant Kingdom was
jointly proposed by two German botanists
**Adolph Engler** ( 1844 -1930) and **Karl A**
**Prantl** (1849 - 1893). They published their
classification in a monumental work “**Die**
**Naturelichen Pflanzen Familien**” in 23
volumes (1887-1915)

In this system of classification the plant
kingdom was divided into 13 divisions. The
first 11 divisions are Thallophytes, twelfth
division is **Embryophyta Asiphonogama**
(plants with embryos but no pollen tubes;
Bryophytes and Pteridophytes) and the
thirteenth division is **Embryophyta**
**Siphonogama** (plants with embryos and
pollen tubes) which includes seed plants.

**II Arthur Cronquist system of classification**
**Arthur Cronquist** (1919 - 1992) an
eminent American taxonomist proposed
phylogenetic classification of flowering plants




![taxonomy and systematic botany](/books/biology/unit-2/taxonomy/Fig5.8.eng.png )


based on a wide range
of taxonomic characters
including anatomical and
phytochemical characters
of phylogenetic importance.
He has presented his
classification in 1968 in his
book titled “**The evolution**
**and classification of flowering plants**.” His
classification is broadly based on the Principles
of phylogeny that finds acceptance with major
contemporary authors.



![taxonomy and systematic botany](/books/biology/unit-2/taxonomy/Fig5.9.eng.png )

Cronquist classified the angiosperms
into two main classes **Magnoliopsida**
(=dicotyledons)
and
**Liliopsida**
(= monocotyledons). There are 6 subclasses,
64 orders, 320 families and about 165,000
species in Magnoliopsida, whereas in
Liliopsida there are 5 sub classes, 19 orders,
66 families and about 50,000 species.


Cronquist system of classification also
could not persist for a long time because, the
system is not very useful for identification
and cannot be adopted in herbaria due to its
high phylogenetic nature.

##### 5.10.4 Angiosperm phylogeny group (APG) classification

The most recent classification of flowering
plants based on phylogenetic data was set
in the last decade of twentieth century. Four
versions of Angiosperm Phylogenetic Group
classification (APG I, APG II, APG III &
APG IV) have been published
in 1998, 2003, 2009 and 2016
respectively. Each version supplants
the previous version. Recognition
of monophyletic group based
on the information received
from various disciplines such
as gross morphology, anatomy,
embryology, palynology, karyology,
phytochemistry and more strongly
on molecular data with respect to
DNA sequences of two chloroplast



![taxonomy and systematic botany](/books/biology/unit-2/taxonomy/Fig5.10.eng.png )

genes (*atp*B and *rbc*L) and one nuclear gene
(nuclear ribosomal 18s DNA).

The most recent updated version, APG
IV (2016) recognised 64 orders and 416
families. Of these, 416 families 259 are
represented in India.

The outline of APG IV classification is
given below.


Angiosperms are classified into three
clades early angiosperms, monocots and
eudicots. Early angiosperms are classified
into **8 orders** and **26 families** (**ANA**-
clade + magnoliids + Chloranthales)

**A**mborellales

**N**ymphaeales

**A**ustrobaileyales


➢Seeds generally always with two
cotyledons.

➢ Presence of ethereal oils.

➢ Leaves are always simple net-veined.

➢ Each floral whorls with many parts.

➢Perianth usually spirally arranged or
parts in threes.

➢ Stamens with broad filaments.

➢ Anthers tetrasporangiate.

➢ Pollen monosulcate.

➢ Nectaries are rare.

➢ Carpels usually free and

➢ Embryo very small.

           





![taxonomy and systematic botany](/books/biology/unit-2/taxonomy/Fig5.11.eng.png )

Monocots are classified into 11 orders
and 77 families (basal monocots + lilioids +
commelinids)

➢ Seeds with single cotyledon.

➢ Primary root short-lived



![taxonomy and systematic botany](/books/biology/unit-2/taxonomy/Fig5.12.eng.png )

➢ Single adaxial prophyll.

➢ Ethereal oils rarely present.

➢	Mostly herbaceous, absence of vascular
cambium.

➢	Vascular bundles are scattered in the stem.

➢ Leaf simple with parallel-veined.

➢ Floral parts usually in threes.

➢ Perianth often composed of tepals.

➢ Pollen monosulcate.

➢ Styles normally hollow and

➢ Successive microsporogenesis.


Eudicots are divided into 45 orders and 313
families (early diverging eudicots + super
rosids + super asterids).

➢ Seeds with always two cotyledons.

➢	Nodes trilacunar with three leaf traces.

➢ Stomata anomocytic.

➢ Ethereal oils rarely present.

➢ Woody or herbaceous plants.

➢	Leaves simple or compound, usually net-
veined.

➢	Flower parts mostly in twos, fours or
fives.

➢ Microsporogenesis simultaneous.

➢ Style solid and

➢ Pollen tricolpate.

APG system is an evolving system that
might undergo change periodically based on
the new sets of data from various disciplines
of Botany. It is the currently accepted system
across the world and followed by all the
leading taxonomic institutions and practising
taxonomists. However, it is yet to percolate
into the Indian botanical curriculum.
Classification reflects the state of our
knowledge at a given point of time. It will
continue to change as we acquire new
information.



{{< box title="Do You Know" type="objective" >}}

A significant number of
major herbaria, including
Kew are changing the
order of their collections
in accordance with APG.

The influential world checklist of
selected plant families (also from kew) is
being updated to the APG III system.

A recent photographic survey of the
plants of USA and Canada is organized
according to the APG III system.

In UK, the latest edition of the standard
flora of the British Isles written by Stace is
based on the APG III system.

##### 5.11 Modern trends in taxonomy

Taxonomists now accept that, the
morphological characters alone should not
be considered in systematic classification
of plants. The complete knowledge of
taxonomy is possible with the principles of
various disciplines like Cytology, Genetics,
Anatomy,
Physiology,
Geographical
Distribution,
Embryology,
Ecology,
Palynology, Phenology, Bio-Chemistry,
Numerical Taxonomy and Transplant
Experiments. These have been found to be
useful in solving some of the taxonomical
problems
by
providing
additional
characters. It has changed the face of
classification from **alpha** (classical) to **omega**
(modern kind). Thus the new systematic
has evolved into a better taxonomy.

##### 5.11.1 Chemotaxonomy

Proteins, amino acids, nucleic acids, peptides
etc. are the most studied chemicals in
chemotaxonomy. Chemotaxonomy is the
scientific approach of classification of plants
on the basis of their biochemical constituents.
As proteins are more closely controlled by
genes and less subjected to natural selection,
it has been used at all hierarchical levels
of classification starting from the rank of
‘variety’ up to the rank of division in plants.

The chemical characters can be divided
into three main categories.

1. Easily visible characters like starch
grains, silica.

2. Characters detected by chemical tests
like phenolics, oil, fats, waxes.

3. Proteins.

**Aims of chemotaxonomy**

1. To develop taxonomic characters
which may improve existing system
of plant classification.

2. To improve present day knowledge of
phylogeny of plants.

##### 5.11.2 Biosystematics

Biosystematics is an “Experimental,
ecological and cytotaxonomy” through
which life forms are studied and their
relationships are defined. The term
biosystematics was introduced by **Camp**
and **Gilly** in 1943. Many authors feel
Biosystematics is closer to Cytogenetics and
Ecology and much importance given not to
classification but to evolution.

**Aims of biosystematics**

The aims of biosystematics are as follows:

1. To delimit the naturally occurring biotic
community of plant species.

2. To establish the evolution of a group of
taxa by understanding the evolutionary
and phylogenetic trends.

3. To involve any type of data gathering
based on modern concepts and not only
on morphology and anatomy.

4. To recognize the various groups as separate
biosystematic categories such as ecotypes,
ecospecies, cenospecies and comparium.

##### 5.11.3 Karyotaxonomy

Chromosomes are the carriers of genetic
information. Increased knowledge about the
chromosomes have been used for extensive
biosystematic studies and resolving many
taxonomic problems. Utilization of the
characters and phenomena of cytology for the
explanation of taxonomic problem is known
as **cytotaxonomy** or **karyotaxonomy**. The
characters of chromosome such as number,
size, morphology and behaviour during
meiosis have proved to be of taxonomic value.

##### 5.11.4 Serotaxonomy (Immunotaxonomy)

**Systematic serology** or serotaxonomy had its
origin towards the end of twentieth century
with the discovery of serological reactions and
development of the discipline of immunology.
The classification of very similar plants by
means of differences in the proteins they
contain, to solve taxonomic problems is
called **serotaxonomy**. **Smith** (1976) defined
it as “**the study of the origins and properties of antisera**.”

**Importance of serotaxonomy**

It determines the degree of similarity between
species, genera, families etc. by comparing the
reactions of antigens from various plant taxa
with antibodies raised against the antigen of
a given taxon.

Example: 1. The assignment of Phaseolus
aureus and P. mungo to the genus Vigna is
strongly supported by serological evidence
by **Chrispeels** and **Gartner**.

##### 5.11.5 Molecular taxonomy (molecular systematics / molecular phylogenetics)

Molecular Taxonomy is the branch of
phylogeny that analyses hereditary molecular
differences, mainly in DNA sequences, to
gain information and to establish genetic
relationship between the members of
different taxonomic categories. The advent of
DNA cloning and sequencing methods have
contributed immensely to the development of
molecular taxonomy and population genetics
over the years. These modern methods
have revolutionised the field of molecular
taxonomy and population genetics with
improved analytical power and precision.

The results of a molecular phylogenetic
analysis are expressed in the form of a tree
called **phylogenetic tree**. Different molecular
markers like allozymes, mitochondrial DNA,
microsatellites, RFLP (Restriction Fragment
Length Polymorphism), RAPD (Random
amplified polymorphic DNA), AFLPs
(Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism),
single nucleotide polymorphism- (SNP),
microchips or arrays are used in analysis.

**Uses of molecular taxonomy**

1. Molecular taxonomy helps in establishing
the relationship of different plant groups
at DNA level.

2. It unlocks the treasure chest of information
on evolutionary history of organisms

**RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism)**

**RFLP**s is a molecular method of genetic
analysis that allows identification of taxa
based on unique patterns of restriction
sites in specific regions of DNA. It refers
to differences between taxa in restriction
sites and therefore the lengths of fragments
of DNA following cleavage with restriction
enzymes

**Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP)**

This method is similar to that of identifying
RFLPs in that a restriction enzyme is used
to cut DNA into numerous smaller pieces,
each of which terminates in a characteristic
nucleotide sequence due to the action of
restriction enzymes.

**AFLP** is largely used for population
genetics studies, but has been used in studies of
closely related species and even in some cases,
for higher level cladistic analysis.

**Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)**


It is a method to identify genetic markers using
a randomly synthesized primer that will anneal
(recombine (DNA) in the double stranded
form) to complementary regions located in
various locations of isolated DNA. If another
complementary site is present on the opposing
DNA strand at a distance that is not too great
(within the limits of PCR) then the reaction
will amplify this region of DNA.


RAPDs like microsatellites may often be
used for genetic studies within species but may
also be successfully employed in phylogenetic
studies to address relationships within a species
or between closely related species. However
RAPD analysis has the major disadvantage
that results are difficult to replicate and in that
the homology of similar bands in different taxa
may be nuclear.


**Significance of Molecular Taxonomy**

1. It helps to identify a very large number of
species of plants and animals by the use of
conserved molecular sequences.

2. Using DNA data evolutionary patterns of
biodiversity are now investigated.

3. DNA taxonomy plays a vital role in
phytogeography, which ultimately helps
in genome mapping and biodiversity
conservation.

4. DNA- based molecular markers used for
designing DNA based molecular probes,
have also been developed under the branch
of molecular systematics.

##### 5.11.6 DNA Barcoding

Have you seen how scanners are used in
supermarkets to distinguish the **Universal**
**Product Code** (UPC)? In the same way
we can also distinguish one species from
another. DNA barcoding is a taxonomic
method that uses a very short genetic
sequence from a standard part of a genome.
The genetic sequence used to identify a
plant is known as “**DNA tags**” or “**DNA**
**barcodes**”. **Paul Hebert** in 2003 proposed
‘**DNA barcoding**’ and he is considered as
‘Father of barcoding’.

The gene region that is being used as an
effective barcode in plants is present in two
genes of the chloroplast, **matK** and **rbcL**, and
have been approved as the barcode regions
for plants.

Sequence of unknown species can
be matched from submitted sequence in
GenBank using Blast (web-programme for
searching the closely related sequence).

**Significance of DNA barcoding**

1. DNA barcoding greatly helps in
identification and classification of
organism.

2. It aids in mapping the extent of
biodiversity.

DNA barcoding techniques require a
large database of sequences for comparison
and prior knowledge of the barcoding region.


However, DNA barcoding is a helpful tool
to determine the authenticity of botanical
material in whole, cut or powdered form.

##### 5.12 Cladistics

Analysis of the taxonomic
data, and the types of
characters that are used in
classification have changed
from time to time. Plants
have been classified based
on the morphology before the advancement
of microscopes, which help in the inclusions
of **sub microscopic** and **microscopic** features.
A closer study is necessary while classifying
closely related plants. Discovery of new finer
molecular analytical techniques coupled with
advanced software and computers has ushered
in a new era of modern or phylogenetic
classification.

The method of classifying organisms into
monophyletic group of a common ancestor
based on shared apomorphic characters
is called **cladistics** (from Greek, *klados*-
branch).

The outcome of a cladistic analysis is
a **cladogram**, a tree-shaped diagram that
represent the best hypothesis of phylogenetic
relationships. Earlier generated cladograms
were largely on the basis of morphological
characters, but now genetic sequencing data
and computational softwares are commonly
used in phylogenetic analysis.

**Cladistic analysis**

Cladistics is one of the primary methods of
constructing phylogenies, or evolutionary
histories. Cladistics uses shared, derived
characters to group organisms into clades.
These clades have atleast one shared, derived
character found in their most recent common
ancestor that is not found in other groups
hence they are considered more closely related
to each other. These shared characters can be
morphological such as, leaf, flower, fruit, seed
and so on; behavioural, like opening of flowers
nocturnal/diurnal; molecular like, DNA or
protein sequence and more.

Cladistics accept only **monophyletic**
**groups**. **Paraphyletic** and **polyphyletic** taxa
are occasionally considered when such taxa
conveniently treated as one group for practical
purposes. Example: dicots, sterculiaceae.
Polyphyletic groups are rejected by cladistics.

i. **Monophyletic group**; Taxa comprising
    all the descendants of a common
    ancestor.
``` goat
              C    A D    B
               \   / \   /
                \ /   \ /
                 +     +
                  \   /
                   \ /
                    .      
```

                    


**ii. Paraphyletic group**; Taxon that
includes an ancestor but not all of the
descendants of that ancestor.

``` goat
              A    C B   D
               \   / \   /
                \ /   \ /
                 +     +

                   \ /
                    .      
```
        
CB, CBD
and ACB are
paraphyletic
group



**iii. Polyphyletic group**; Taxa that
includes members from two different
lineages

``` goat                            
              C    A D    B                W   X Z   Y

                    .                           .     
```


##### Need for cladistics

1. Cladistics is now the most commonly
used and accepted method for creating
phylogenetic system of classifications.


2. Cladistics produces a hypothesis about
the relationship of organisms to predict
the phylogeny


3. Cladistics helps to elucidate mechanism
of evolution.

In *Yucca* the cross-pollination is carried out by special moth,
*Pronuba yuccasella*. Fully opened flowers emit perfumes and
are visited by the female moth, especially during nights. This
moth collects a lot of pollen grains from one flower and visits
another flower. Life history of this moth is intimately associated with the
pollination mechanism in *Yucca*.

##### Summary

Taxonomy deals with the identification,
naming and classification of plants. But systematics
deals with evolutionary relationship between the
organisms in addition to taxonomy. Taxonomic
hierarchy was introduced by Carolus Linnaeus
It also includes ranks. Species is the fundamental
unit of taxonomic classification. Species concept
can be classified into two groups based on the
process of evolution and product of evolution
There are three types of species, morphological,
biological and phylogenetic
species. Taxonomic aids are the
tools for the taxonomic study
such as keys, flora, revisions,
catalogues, botanical gardens
and herbaria. Botanical gardens
serve different purposes. They
have aesthetic value, offers
scope for botanical research,
conservation of rare species
and propagation of many
species. Botanical survey of
India explores and documents
biodiversity all over India.
It has 11 regional centres in
India. Herbarium preparation
includes plant collection,
documentation of field data,
preparation of plant specimens
mounting
and
labelling.
There are several national and
international herbaria. National
herbaria include MH, PCM,
CAL etc. Kew herbarium is the
world’s largest one.

Classification
is
the basis for cataloguing and
retrieving information about
the tremendous diversity of flora. It helps us to
know about different varieties, their phylogenetic
relationship and exact position. Some important
deals with evolutionary relationship between the
systems of classification are fall in to three
organisms in addition to taxonomy. Taxonomic
types; artificial, natural and phylogenetic.
Carolus Linnaeus outlined an artificial system
It also includes ranks. Species is the fundamental
of classification in “Species Plantarum” in 1753.
unit of taxonomic classification. Species concept
The first scheme of classification based on overall
can be classified into two groups based on the
similarities was presented by Antoine Laurent De
process of evolution and product of evolution.
Jessieu in 1789. A widely followed natural system
of classification was proposed by George Bentham
(1800 - 1884) and Joseph Dalton Hooker. This
system was not intended to be phylogenetic. One
of the earliest phylogenetic systems of classification
was jointly proposed by Adolf Engler and Karl A
Prantl in a monumental work “**Die Naturelichen**
**Pflanzen Familien**”. Arthur Cronquist proposed
phylogenetic classification of flowering plants
based on a wide range of taxonomic characters
including anatomical and phytochemical of
phylogenetic importance in his book titled “The
evolution and classification of flowering plants.”
Angiosperm phylogeny group (APG) classification
is the most recent classification of flowering plants
based on phylogenetic data. APG system is an
evolving and currently accepted system across the
world and followed by all the leading taxonomic
institutions and practising taxonomists.


Cladistics is the methodology, used 
to classify
organisms into monophyletic groups, consisting
of all the descents of the common ancestors. The
outcome of a cladistic analysis is a cladogram and
is constructed to represent the best hypothesis of
phylogenetic relationships. Chemotaxonomy is
the scientific approach of classification of plants on
the basis of their biochemical constituents in them.
Utilization of the characters of chromosome for the
taxonomic inference is known as karyotaxonomy.
The application of serology in solving taxonomic
problems is called serotaxonomy. Molecular
Taxonomy is the branch of phylogeny that
analyses hereditary molecular differences, mainly
in DNA nuclear and chloroplast sequences, to gain
information and to establish genetic relationship
between the members of different taxonomic
categories. Different molecular markers like
allozymes, mitochondrial DNA, microsatellites,
RAPDs, AFLPs, single nucleotide polymorphism-
(SNP), microchips or arrays are used in analysis.
Molecular Taxonomy unlocks the treasure
chest of information on evolutionary history of
organisms. It plays a vital role in phytogeography,
which ultimately helps in genome mapping and
biodiversity conservation. DNA barcoding is a
taxonomic method that uses a very short genetic
sequence from a standard part of a genome. It
helps in identification of organisms.

        b. Thevetia

        c. Datura

        d. Solanum


5. What is the role of national gardens in
conserving biodiversity – discuss

6. Where will you place the plants which
contain two cotyledons with cup shaped
thalamus?

7. Give the floral characters of Clitoria
ternatea.

8. How will you distinguish Solanaceae
members from Liliaceae members?
