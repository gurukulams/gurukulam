The Banyan tree continues to grow for
thousands of years and some others particularly
annual plants cease growth within a season or
within a year. Can you understand the reasons?
How does a zygote give rise to an embryo and
an embryo to a seedling? How does a new plant
structure arise from the pre-existing structure?
Growth is defined as an irreversible permanent
increase in size, shape, number,volume and dry
weight. Plant growth occurs by cell division, cell
enlargement, differentiation and maturation.<br>

Growth is measurable, it
is amazing to know that
one single maize root apical
meristem can give rise to
more than 17,500 new cells per hour and
cells in a watermelon may increase in size
upto 3,50,000 times.

Bamboos are evergreen
grasses and certain species
of it can grow at the rate of
growth 91 cm per day. The
Saguaro Cactus is a tree like
cactus and is a slow growing
plant. The rate of growth is one inch in the
first ten years and it does not begin to flower
until it is about 60 years old. It’s lifespan
exceeds 150 years and takes 75–100 years to
grow a side arm.<br>

#### 15.1 Characteristics of Growth <br>
• Growth increases in protoplasm at cellular
level.<br>
• Stem and roots are indeterminate in
growth due to continuous cell division
and is called **open form of growth.**<br>
• The primary growth of the plant is due
to the activity of apical meristem where,
new cells are added to root and shoot apex
causing linear growth of plant body.<br>
• The secondary vascular cambium and
cork cambium add new cells to cause
increase in girth.<br>
• Leaves, flowers and fruits are limited in
growth or determinate or **closed form growth.**<br>
• Monocarpic annual plants produce
flowers only once during lifetime and
dies. Example: Paddy and Bean <br>
• Monocarpic perennials produce flowers
only once during life time but the plants
survive for many years. Example: Bamboo.<br>
• Polycarpic perennials produce flowers every
year during life time. Example: Coconut.<br>
#### 15.1.1 Kinetics of growth<br>
It is an analysis of the motion of cells or
expansion.<br>
**1.Stages in Growth rate**<br>
The total period from initial to the final stage of
growth is called the **grand period of growth.**
The total growth is plotted against time and ‘S’
shaped sigmoid curve (Grand period curve) is
obtained. It consists of four phases.
They are:<br>
i. Lag phase<br>
ii. Log phase<br>
iii. Decelerating phase<br>
iv. Maturation phase<br>
**i. Lag phase**<br>
In this phase new cells are formed from
pre-existing cells slowly. It is found in the tip
of the stem, root and branches. It is the initial
stage of growth. In other words, growth starts
from this period.<br>
**ii. Log phase or exponential growth**<br>
Here, the newly formed cell increases in size
rapidly by deposition of cell wall material.
Growth rate is maximum and reaches top
because of cell division and physiological
processes are quite fast. The volume of
protoplasm also increases. It results in rapid
growth and causes elongation of internode in
the stem.<br>
**iii. Decelerating phase or Decline phase or slow growth phase**<br>
The rate of growth decreases and becomes
limited owing to internal and external or both
the factors because the metabolic process
becomes slow.<br>
**iv. Steady state period or maturation phase**<br>
In this phase cell wall thickening due to new
particle deposition on the inner surface of
the cell wall takes place. The overall growth
ceases and becomes constant. The growth rate
becomes zero.<br>
**2. Types of growth rate**<br>
The increased growth per unit time is termed as
growth rate. An organism or part of an organism
can produce more cells through arithmetic
growth or geometric growth or both.<br>
**i. Arithmetic Growth Rate**
If the length of a plant organ is plotted
against time, it shows a linear curve and this
growth is called arithmetic growth.<br>
• The rate of growth is constant and it
increases in an arithmetic manner.<br>
• Only one cell is allowed to divide
between the two-resulting progeny cell.<br>
• One continues to divide but the other
undergoes cell cycle arrest and begins
to develop, differentiate and mature.<br>
• After each round of cell division, only
a single cell remains capable of division
and one new body cell forms.<br>
For example, starting with a single cell after
round 1 of cell division there is one dividing
cell and one body cell. After round 2 there
are two body cells, after round 3 there are
three and so on (Figure 15.1).<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/plant-growth-and-development/03.png)<br>
**Figure 15.1:** Arithmetic Growth Rate <br>
The plants single dividing cell would
undergo one million rounds of nuclear and
cellular division. If each round requires one
day, this type of arithmetic increase would
require one million days or 2739.7 years.
This arithmetic rate is capable of producing
small number of cells present in very small
parts of plants. For example the hair on
many leaves and stems consists of just a
single row of cells produced by the division
of the basal cell, the cell at the bottom of the
hair next to other epidermal cells. Hair may
contain 5 to 10 cells by the division of the
basal cell. So, all its cells could be produced
in just five to ten days. In the figure 15.2, on
plotting the hight of the plant against time a
linear curve is obtained. Mathematically it is
expressed as:<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/plant-growth-and-development/04.png)<br>
**Figure 15.2:** Constant Linear Growth <br>
L t = L o + rt <br>
L t = length at time ‘t’ <br>
L o = length at time zero <br>
r = growth rate of elongation per unit <br>
**ii. Geometric growth rate:**<br>
This growth occurs in many higher plants
and plant organs and is measured in size
or weight. In plant growth, geometric cell
division results if all cells of an organism or
tissue are active mitotically. Example: Round
three in the given figure 15.3, produces 8
cells as \\(2^3\\) = 8 and after round 20 there are \\(2^20\\)
= 1,048,576 cells.
The large plant or animal parts are
produced this way. In fact, it is common in
animals but rare in plants except when they
are young and small. Exponential growth
curve can be expressed as,<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/plant-growth-and-development/05.png)<br>
**Figure 15.3:** Geometric growth<br>
${W_1 = W_0e^{rt}}$ <br>
\\(W_1\\) =Final size (weight, height and
number)<br>
\\(W_0\\) =Initial size at the beginning of the
period <br>
r = Growth rate <br>
t = Time of growth<br>
e = Base of the natural logarithms<br>
Here ‘r’ is the relative growth rate and
also a measure of the ability of the plant to
produce new plant material, referred to as
efficiency index. Hence, the final size of \\(W_1\\)
depends on the initial size\\(W_0\\) <br>
**iii. Arithmetic and Geometric Growth of Embryo**
Plants often grow by a combination
of arithmetic and geometric growth
patterns. A young embryonic plant grows
geometrically and cell division becomes
restricted to certain cells at the tips of roots
and shoots. After this point, growth is of
the slower arithmetic type, but some of the
new cells that are produced can develop into
their mature condition and begin carrying
out specialized types of metabolism
(Figure 15.4). Plants are thus a mixture of
older, mature cells and young, dividing cells.<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/plant-growth-and-development/06.png)<br>
**Figure 15.4:** Arithmetic and geometric growth of embryo<br>
Quantitative comparisons between the
growth of living system can also be made in
two ways and is explained in the table 1.
In figure 15.5, two leaves A and B are
drawn at a particular time. Then \\(A_1\\) and
\\(B_1\\)are drawn after a given time. A and
B = Area of leaves at a particular time.\\(A_1\\)
and B 1 = Area of leaves after a given time.
(\\(A_1\\) -A) and (\\(B_1\\) -B) represents an absolute
increase in area in the given time. Leaf A
increases from 5 cm 2 to 10 cm 2 ; 5 cm 2 in a
given time. Leaf B increases from 50 cm 2 to
55 cm 2 ; 5 cm 2 in a given time. Hence, both
leaves A and B increase their area by 5 cm 2
in a given time. This is absolute growth.
Relative growth is faster in leaf A because of
initial small size. It decreases with time.<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/plant-growth-and-development/07.png)<br>
**Figure 15.5:** Diagrammatic comparision of absolute and relative growth rates  <br>               
**Measurement of Growth**<br>
**Experiment: 1. Arc auxanometer:**<br>
The increase in the length of the stem tip can
easily be measured by an arc auxanometer
which consists of a small pulley to the axis
of which is attached a long pointer sliding
over a graduated arc. A thread one end of
which is tied to the stem tip and another end
to a weight passes over the pulley tightly. As
soon as the stem tip increases in length, the
pulley moves and the pointer slide over the
graduated arc (Figure 15.6). The reading is
taken. The actual increase in the length of
the stem is then calculated by knowing the
length of the pointer and the radius of the
pulley. If the distance travelled by the pointer
is 10 and the radius of the pulley is 4 inches
and the length of the pint is 20 inches, the
actual grown is measured as follows:<br>
Actual growth in length = (Distance travelled by the pointer × radius of the pulley) / Length of the pointer.<br>
For example,
actual growth in length =
(10 × 4 inches)/ 20 inches = 2 inches <br>

#### 15.2 Plant Growth Regulators<br>
Plant Growth Regulators (chemical messenger)
are defined as organic substances which are
synthesized in minute quantities in one part of
the plant body and transported to another part
where they influence specific physiological
processes. Five major groups of hormones viz.,
auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, ethylene and
abscisic acid are presently known to coordinate
and regulate growth and development in plants.
The term phytohormones is implied to those
chemical substances which are synthesized by
plants and thus, naturally occurring. On the
other hand, there are several manufactured
chemicals which often resemble the hormones
in physiological action and
even in molecular structure.
Recently, another two groups,
the brassinosteroids and
polyamines were also known
to behave like hormones.<br>
**1. Plant growth regulators – classification**<br>
Plant Growth Regulators are classified as
natural and synthetic based on their source
and a detailed flow diagram is given in
Figure 15.7.<br>

**Figure 15.7:** Classification of Plant Growth
Regulators.<br>
**2. Characteristics of phytohormones**<br>
i. Usually produced in tips of roots, stems
and leaves.<br>
ii. Transfer of hormones from one place to
another takes part through conductive
systems.<br>
iii. They are required in trace quantities.<br>
iv. All hormones are organic in nature.<br>
v. There are no specialized cells or organs for
their secretion.<br>
vi. They are capable of influencing
physiological activities leading to
promotion, inhibition and modification
of growth.<br>
**3. Synergistic and Antagonistic effects**<br>
**i. Synergistic effects:** The effect of one or
more substance in such a way that both
promote each others activity. Example:
Activity of auxin and gibberellins or
cytokinins.<br>
**ii. Antagonistic effects:** The effect of two
substances in such a way that they have
opposite effects on the same process. One
accelerates and other inhibits. Example:
ABA and gibberellins during seed or bud
dormancy. ABA induces dormancy and
gibberellins break it.<br>
#### 15.2.1 Auxins <br>
**1. Discovery**<br>
During 1880, **Charles Darwin** noted the
unilateral growth and curvature of Canary
grass (*Phalaris canariensis*) coleoptile to light.
The term auxin (*Greek*: Auxin – to Grow) was
first used by **F. W. Went** in 1926 using Oats
(*Avena*) coleoptile and isolated the auxin. F. W.
Went in 1928 collected auxin in agar jelly.**Kogl
and **Haugen Smith** (1931) isolated Auxin
from human urine, and called it as **Auxin A.**
Later on in 1934, similar active substances was
isolated from corn grain oil and was named as
**Auxin B.** Kogl et al., (1934) found heteroauxin
in the plant and chemically called it as **Indole Acetic Acid (IAA)**<br>
**2.Occurrence**<br>
Auxin is generally produced by the growing
tips of the stem and root, from where they
migrate to the region of the action.<br>
**3. Types of Auxin**<br>
Auxins are divided into two categories Natural
auxins and Synthetic auxins.<br>
{{<box title="">}}
**Anti-auxins**<br>
Anti-auxin compounds when applied to the
plant inhibit the effect of auxin. Example:
2, 4, 5-Tri Iodine Benzoic Acid (TIBA) and
Napthylpthalamine.

2. Indole Propionic Acid (IPA)          2. 2,4,5-Trichloro Phenoxy Acetic Acid (2,4,5-T)
3. Indole Butyric Acid (IBA)            3. Napthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)
4. Phenyl Acetic Acid (PAA)
```
**(i) Free auxin**<br>
They move out of tissues as they are easily diffusible. Example: IAA.
**(ii) Bound Auxin**<br>
They are not diffusible. Example: IAA.<br>
**4. Precursor**<br>
The amino acid Tryptophan is the precursor of IAA and zinc is required for its synthesis<br>
**5. Chemical structure**<br>
Auxin is polar in transport. It includes basipetal and acropetal transport. Basipetal means transport through phloem from shoot to root and acropetal means transport through xylem from root to shoot.<br>
**7. Bioassay (Avena Curvature Test /Went Experiment)**<br>
Bioassay means testing of substances for their activity in causing a growth response in a living plant or its part.
**The procedure involves the following steps:**<br>
When the *Avena* seedlings have attained a
height of 15 to 30 mm, about 1mm of the
coleoptile tip is removed. This apical part is
the source of natural auxin. The tip is now
placed on agar blocks for few hours. During
this period, the auxin diffuses out of these tips
into the agar. The auxin containing agar block
is now placed on one side of the decapitated
stump of Avena coleoptile. The auxin from the agar blocks diffuses down through coleoptile along the side to which the auxin agar block is placed. An agar block without auxin is placed on another decapitated coleoptile. Within an hour 
the coleoptiles with auxin agar block bends on the opposite side where the agar block is placed.This curvature can be measured (Figure 15.8).<br>
**8.Physiological Effects**<br>
• They promote cell elongation in stem and coleoptile.<br>
• At higher concentrations auxins inhibit the elongationof roots but extermely lower concentrations
promotes growth of root.<br>
• Suppression of growth in lateral bud by apical bud due to auxin produced by apical bud is termed as apical dominance<br>
• Auxin prevents abscission.<br>
• It is used to eradicate weeds. Example: 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T.<br>
• Synthetic auxins are used in the formation of seedless fruits (Parthenocarpic fruit).<br>
• It is used to break the dormancy in seeds.<br>

**Figure 15.8:** Avena Curvature Test<br>
#### 15.2.2 Gibberellins<br>
**1. Discovery**<br>
The effect of gibberellins had been known in Japan since early 1800 where certain rice plants were found to suffer from **‘Bakanae’** or foolish seedling disease. This disease was found by **Kurosawa**(1926) to be caused by a fungus *Gibberella* *fujikuroi.* The active substance was separated from fungus and named as<br>
gibberellin by **Yabuta** (1935). These are more
than 100 gibberellins reported from both fungi
and higher plants. They are noted as \\(GA_1\\) ,\\(GA_2\\),
\\(GA_3\\) and so on. \\(GA_3\\) is the first discovered
gibberellin. In 1938, **Yabuta** and **Sumiki**
isolated gibberellin in crystalline form. In1955,
**Brain** et al., gave the name **gibberellic acid**. In
1961, Cross et al., established its structure.<br>
{{<box title="">}}<br>
**Agent Orange**<br>
Mixture of two phenoxy herbicides 2,4-D
and 2,4,5-T is given the name ‘Agent orange’
which was used by USA in Vietnam war for
defoliation of forest (chemical warfare).
{{</box>}}<br>
{{<box title="">}}
![](/books/biology/unit-5/plant-growth-and-development/10.png)<br>
In botanical gardens and tea gardens, gardeners
trim the plants regularly so that they remain
bushy. Does this practice have any scientific
explanation?
Yes, trimming of plants removes apical buds
and hence apical dominance. The lateral buds
sprout and make the plants bushy.
{{</box>}}
**2. Occurrence**<br>
The major site of gibberellin production in
plants is parts like embryo, roots and young
leaves near the tip. Immature seeds are rich in
gibberellins.
**3.Precursors**<br>
The gibberellins are chemically related to
terpenoids (natural rubber, carotenoids and
steroids) formed by 5-C precursor, an Isoprenoid
unit called Iso Pentenyl Pyrophosphate (IPP)
through a number of intermediates. The
primary precursor is acetate.<br>
**4.Chemical structure**<br>
All gibberellins have gibbane ring structure.<br>
**5.Transport in plants**<br>
The transport of gibberellins in plants is non-
polar. Gibberellins are translocated through
phloem and also occur in xylem due to lateral
movement between vascular bundles.<br>
**6.Bioassay (Dwarf Pea assay)**<br>
Seeds of dwarf pea are allowed to germinate
till the formation of the coleoptile. GA
solution is applied to some seedlings. Others
are kept under control. Epicotyl length
is measured and as such, GA stimulating
epicotyl growth can be seen.<br>
**7.Physiological Effects**<br>
• It produces extraordinary elongation of stem
caused by cell division and cell elongation.<br>
• Rosette plants (genetic dwarfism) exhibit
excessive internodal growth when they
are treated with gibberellins. This sudden
elongation of stem followed by flowering
by the application of gibberellin is called
bolting (Figure 15.9).<br>
• Gibberellin breaks dormancy in potato
tubers.<br>
• Many biennials usually flower during
second year of their growth. For flowering
in the first year it self these plants should be
treated with gibberellins.<br>
• Formation of seedless fruits without fertili-
zation is induced by gibberellins Example:
Seedless tomato, apple and cucumber.<br>
• Promotes elongation of inter-node in
sugarcane without decreasing sugar content.<br>
• Promotion of flowering in long day plants
even under short day conditions.<br>
• It stimulates the seed germination.<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/plant-growth-and-development/11.png)<br>
**Figure 15.9:** Bolting <br>

#### 15.2.3 Cytokinins (Cytos – cell, Kinesis – division)<br>
**1. Discovery**<br>
The presence of cell division inducing
substances in plants was first demonstrated by
**Haberlandt** in 1913 in Coconut milk (liquid
endosperm of coconut) which contains cell
division inducing substances. In 1954, Skoog
and Miller discovered that autoclaved DNA
from herring sperm stimulated cell division in
tobacco pith cells. They called this cell division
inducing principle as kinetin (chemical
structure: 6-Furfuryl Amino Acid). This does
not occur in plants. In 1963, Letham introduced
the term cytokinin. In 1964, Letham and
Miller isolated and identified a new cytokinin
called **Zeatin** from unripe grains of maize. The
most widely occurring cytokinin in plants is
Iso Pentenyl adenine (IPA).<br>
**2. Occurrence**<br>
Cytokinin is formed in root apex, shoot apex,
buds and young fruits.<br>
**3. Precursor**<br>
Cytokinins are derivatives of the purine adenine.<br>
**4. Bioassay (Neem Cotyledon Assay)**<br>
Neem cotyledons are measured and placed
in cytokinin solution as well as in ordinary
water. Enlargement of cotyledons is an
indication of cytokinin activity.<br>
**5. Transport in plants**<br>
The distribution of cytokinin in plants is not
as wide as those of auxin and gibberellins but
found mostly in roots. Cytokinins appear to be
translocated through xylem.<br>
**6. Physiological effect**<br>
• Cytokinin promotes cell division in the
presence of auxin (IAA).<br>
• Cytokinin induces cell enlargement
associated with IAA and gibberellins<br>
• Cytokinin can break the dormancy of
certain light-sensitive seeds like tobacco and
induces seed germination.<br>
•Cytokinin promotes the growth of lateral
bud in the presence of apical bud.<br>
• Application of cytokinin delays the
process of aging by nutrient mobilization.
It is known as Richmond Lang effect.<br>
• Cytokinin (i) increases rate protein
synthesis (ii) induces the formation of
inter-fascicular cambium (iii) overcomes
apical dominance (iv) induces formation of
new leaves, chloroplast and lateral shoots.<br>
• Plants accumulate solutes very actively
with the help of cytokinins.<br>
Almost all plant tissues produce ethylene gas
in minute quantities.<br>
**1. Discovery**<br>
In 1924, **Denny** found that ethylene stimulates
the ripening of lemons. In 1934, **R. Gane** found
that ripe bananas contain abundant ethylene.
In 1935, **Cocken** et al., identified ethylene as a
natural plant hormone.<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/plant-growth-and-development/12.png)<br>
**2. Occurrence**<br>
Maximum synthesis occurs during climacteric
ripening of fruits (see Box info) and tissues
undergoing senescence. It is formed in almost
all plant parts like roots, leaves, flowers, fruits
and seeds.<br>
3. Transport in plants<br>
Ethylene can easily diffuse inside the plant
through intercellular spaces.
4. Precursor<br>
It is a derivative of amino acid methionine,
linolenic acid and fumaric acid.<br>
5. Bioassay (Gas Chromatography)
Ethylene can be measured by gas
chromatography. This technique helps in the
detection of exact amount of ethylene from
different plant tissues like lemon and orange.<br>
6. Physiological Effects
• Ethylene stimulates respiration and
ripening in fruits.<br>
• It breaks the dormancy of buds, seeds and
storage organs.<br>
• It stimulates formation of abscission zone
in leaves, flowers and fruits. This makes
the leaves to shed prematurely.<br>
• Inhibition of stem elongation (shortening
the internode).<br>
• Growth of lateral roots and root hairs.
This increases the absorption surface of
the plant roots.<br>
• Ethylene normally reduces flowering in
plants except in Pine apple and ­Mango.<br>
#### 15.2.5 Abscisic Acid (ABA) (Stress Phytohormone)<br>
**1. Discovery**<br>
In 1963, the hormone was first isolated
by **Addicott et al.**, from young cotton
bolls and named as **Abscission II**. Eagles
and Wareing during 1963–64 isolated a
dormancy inducing substance from leaves
of Betula and called it as dormin. In 1965,
it was found by Cornsforth et al., that both
dormin and abscission are chemically
same compounds and called **Abscisic Acid (ABA)**.<br>
**2. Occurrence**<br>
This hormone is found abundantly inside
the chloroplast of green cells.<br>
**3.Precursors**<br>
The hormone is formed from mevalonic
acid pathway or xanthophylls.<br>
**4.Transport in plants**<br>
Abscisic acid is transported to all parts of the
plant through diffusion as well as through
phloem and xylem.<br>
**5. Chemical structure**<br>
It has carotenoid structure.
**6.Bioassay (Rice Coleoptile)**<br>
The inhibition of IAA induces straight
growth of rice seedling coleoptiles.<br>
**7. Physiological effects**<br>
• It helps in reducing transpiration rate by
closing stomata.<br>
• ABA is a powerful growth inhibitor. It
causes 50% inhibition of growth in Oat
coleoptile.<br>
• It induces bud and seed dormancy.<br>
• It promotes the abscission of leaves, flowers
and fruits by forming abscission layers.<br>
• ABA plays an important role in plants
during water stress and during drought
conditions. It results in loss of turgor and
closure of stomata.<br>
• In Cannabis sativa, induces male flower
formation on female plants.<br>
• It promotes sprouting in storage organs like
Potato.<br>
• It inhibits the shoot growth and promotes
growth of root system. This character
protect the plants from water stress.
Hence, ABA is called as stress hormone.<br>
#### 15.3 Photoperiodism<br>
Trees take several years for initiation of
flowering whereas an annual herb flowers
within few months. Each plant requires
a specific time period to complete their
vegetative phase which will be followed by
reproductive phase as per their internal
control points through Biological Clock.
The physiological mechanisms in relation to
flowering are controlled by (i) light period
(**Photoperiodism**) and (ii) temperature
(Vernalization). The physiological change
on flowering due to relative length of
light and darkness (photoperiod) is called
Photoperiodism. The term photoperiodism
was coined by **Garner** and **Allard** (1920)
when they observed this in ‘Biloxi’ variety
of soybean (*Glycine max*) and ‘Maryland
mammoth’ variety of tobacco (*Nicotiana tabacum*). The photoperiod required to
induce flowering is called **critical day**
**length.** Maryland mammoth (tobacco
variety) requires 12 hours of light and
cocklebur
(*Xanthium pensylvanicum*)
requires 15.05 hours of light for flowering.<br>
#### 1. Classification of plants based on Photoperiodism <br>
**i. Long day plants:** The plants that require
long critical day length for flowering are
called long day plants or short night
plants. Example: Pea, Barley and Oats.<br>
**ii. Short day plants:** The plants that require
a short critical day length for flowering
are called short day plants or long night
plants. Example: Tobacco, Cocklebur,
Soybean, Rice and **Chrysanthemum.**<br>
iii. Day neutral plants: There are a
number of plants which can flower in
all possible photoperiods. They are also
called photo neutrals or indeterminate
plants. Example: Potato, *Rhododendron*,
Tomato and Cotton.<br>
#### 2.Photoperiodic induction<br>
An appropriate photoperiod in 24 hours’
cycle constitutes one inductive cycle. Plants
may require one or more inductive cycles for
flowering. The phenomenon of conversion of
leaf primordia into flower primordia under
the influence of suitable inductive cycles is
called **photoperiodic induction**. Example:
*Xanthium* (SDP) – 1 inductive cycle and
*Plantago*(LDP) – 25 inductive cycles.<br>
#### 3. Site of Photoinductive perception<br>
Photoperiodic stimulus is perceived by the
leaves. Floral hormone is synthesised in
leaves and translocated to the apical tip to
promote flowering. This can be explained
by a simple experiment on Cocklebur
(*Xanthium pensylvanicum*), a short day plant.
Usually *Xanthium* will flower under short
day conditions. If the plant is defoliated and
kept under short day conditions it will not
flower. Flowering will occur even when all
the leaves are removed except one leaf. If a
cocklebur plant is defoliated and kept under
long day conditions, it will not flower. If one
of its leaves is exposed to short day condition
and rest are in long day condition, flowering
will occur (Figure 15.10).<br>

**Figure 15.10:** Experiment on Cocklebur
plant showing photoperiodic stimulus <br>
#### 4. Importance of photoperiodism<br>
1. The knowledge of photoperiodism
plays an important role in hybridisation
experiments.<br>
2. Photoperiodism is an excellent example
of physiological pre-conditioning that
is using an external factor to induce
physiological changes in the plant.<br>
#### 5. Phytochrome<br>
```goat

Phytochrome is a bluish biliprotein pigment
responsible for the perception of light in
photo physiological process. **Butler et al.**,<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/plant-growth-and-development/14.png)<br>
(1959) named this pigment and it exists
in two interconvertible forms: (i) red light
absorbing pigment which is designated as
${P_{fr}}$ and (ii) far red light absorbing pigment
which is designated as ${P_{fr}}$  . The ${P_r}$  form
absorbs red light in 660nm and changes to P fr.
The P fr form absorbs far red light in 730nm
and changes to ${P_r}$  . The ${P_r}$  form is biologically
inactive and it is stable whereas ${P_{fr}}$ form is
biologically active and it is very unstable. In
short day plants, ${P_r}$  promotes flowering and
${P_{fr}}$ inhibits the flowering whereas in long
day plants flowering is promoted by ${P_{fr}}$ and
inhibited by ${P_r}$ form. ${P_{fr}}$ is always associated
with hydrophobic area of membrane systems
while${P_r}$  is found in diffused state in the
cytoplasm. The interconversion of the two
forms of phytochrome is mainly involved in
flower induction and also additionally playsa role in seed germination and changes in
membrane conformation.
### 15.4 Vernalization (*Vernal* – Spring Like)<br>
Besides photoperiod certain plants require
a low temperature exposure in their earlier
stages for flowering. Many species of
biennials and perennials are induced to
flower by low temperature exposure \\(0^oC  to  5^oC\\). This process is called **Vernalization.**
The term Vernalization was first used by **T.D. Lysenko** (1938).<br>
1. Mechanism of Vernalization:<br>
Two main theories to explain the mechanism
of vernalization are:<br>
i. Hypothesis of phasic development<br>
ii. Hypothesis of hormonal involvement<br>
**i. Hypothesis of phasic development**<br>
According to Lysenko, development of an
annual seed plant consists of two phases. First
phase is **thermostage**, which is vegetative
phase requiring low temperature and suitable
moisture. Next phase is **photo stage** which
requires high temperature for synthesis of
florigen (flowering hormone).<br>
**ii. Hypothesis of hormonal involvement**<br>
According to Purvis (1961), formation of a
substance A from its precursor, is converted
into B after chilling. The substance B is unstable.
At suitable temperature B is converted into
stable compound D called **Vernalin**. Vernalin
is converted to F (Florigen). Florigen induces
flower formation. At high temperature B is
converted to C and devernalization occurs
(Figure 15.11)<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/plant-growth-and-development/15.png)<br>
**Figure 15.11:** Vernalization and Flowering<br>
**2. Technique of Vernalization:**<br>
The seeds are first soaked in water and
allowed to germinate at \\(10^oC\\) to \\(12^oC\\). Then
seeds are transferred to low temperature \\(3^oC\\)
to \\(5^oC\\) from few days to 30 days. Germinated
seeds after this treatment are allowed to dry
and then sown. The plants will show quick
flowering when compared to untreated
control plants.<br>
**3. Devernalization**<br>
Reversal of the effect of vernalization is
called **devernalization**.<br>
**4.Practical applications**<br>
1.Vernalization shortens the vegetative period
and induces the plant to flower earlier.<br>
2. It increases the cold resistance of the plants.<br>
3. It increases the resistance of plants to fungal
disease.<br>
4. Plant breeding can be accelerated.<br>
#### 15.5 Seed Germination and Dormancy<br>
**I.Seed Germination**<br>
The activation and growth of embryo from seed
into seedling during favourable conditions is
called **seed germination.**<br>
**1.Types of germination**<br>
There are two methods of seed germination.
Epigeal and hypogeal.<br>
**i. Epigeal germination**<br>
During epigeal germination cotyledons are
pushed out of the soil. This happens due to the
elongation of the hypocotyl. Example: Castor
and Bean.<br>
**ii. Hypogeal germination**<br>
During hypogeal germination cotyledons
remain below the soil due to rapid elongation of
epicotyls (Figure 15.12). Example: Maize, Pea.<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/plant-growth-and-development/16.png)<br>
**Figure 15.12:** (a) Epigeal Germination <br>
                (b) Hypogeal Germination<br>
**2. Factors affecting germination**<br>
Seed germination is directly affected by
external and internal factors:<br>
**i. External factors**<br>
**a. Water:** It activates the enzymes which
digest the complex reserve foods of the
seed. If the water content of the seed goes
below a critical level, seeds fail to germinate.<br>
**b.Temperature:** Seeds fails to germinate
at very low and high temperature. The
optimum temperature is \\(25^oC\\) to \\(35^oC\\) for
most tropic species<br>.
**c.Oxygen:** It is necessary for germination.
Since aerobic respiration is a physiological
requirement for germination most will
germinate well in air containing 20%
oxygen.<br>
**d.Light:** There are many seeds which
respond to light for germination and these
seeds said to be photoblastic.<br>
**e.Soil conditions:** Germination of seed
in its natural habit is influenced by soil
conditions such as water holding capacity,
mineral composition and aeration of the
soil.<br>
**ii. Internal factors**<br>
**a. Maturity of embryo:** The seeds of some
plants, when shed will contain immature
embryo. Such seeds germinate only after
maturation of embryo.<br>
**b.Viability:** Usually seeds remain viable or
living only for a particular period. Viability
of seeds range from a few days (Example:
*Oxalis*) to more than hundred years.
Maximum viability (1000 years) has been
recorded in lotus seeds. Seeds germinate
only within the period of viability.
**c.Dormancy:** Seeds of many plants are
dormant at the time of shedding. A detailed
treatment is given below.<br>
**II. Seed Dormancy**<br>
The seeds of most plants germinate under
favourable environmental conditions but
some seeds do not germinate when suitable
conditions like water, oxygen and favourable
temperature are not available. Germination of
such seeds may be delayed for days, months
or years. The condition of a seed when it fails
to germinate even in suitable environmental
condition is called **seed dormancy**. There
are two main reasons for the development of
dormancy: Imposed dormancy and innate
dormancy. Imposed dormancy is due to
low moisture and low temperature. Innate
dormancy is related to the properties of seed
itself.
**1. Factors causing dormancy of seeds:**<br>
i. Hard, tough seed coat causes barrier
effect as impermeability of water, gas and
restriction of the expansion of embryo
prevents seed germination.<br>
ii. Many species of seeds produce imperfectly
developed embryos called **rudimentary**
**embryos** which promotes dormancy.<br>
iii. Lack of specific light requirement leads to
seed dormancy.<br>
iv. A range of temperatures either higher or
lower cause dormancy.<br>
v. The presence of inhibitors like phenolic
compounds which inhibits seed
germination cause dormancy.<br>
**2. Methods of breaking dormancy:**<br>
The dormancy of seeds can be broken by
different methods. These are:
**i.Scarification:** Mechanical and chemical
treatments like cutting or chipping of hard
tough seed coat and use of organic solvents
to remove waxy or fatty compounds are
called as **Scarification**.<br>
**ii. Impaction:** In some seeds water and
oxygen are unable to penetrate micropyle
due to blockage by cork cells. These seeds
are shaken vigorously to remove the plug
which is called **Impaction.**<br>
**iii. Stratification:** Seeds of rosaceous plants
(Apple, Plum, Peach and Cherry) will not
germinate until they have been exposed
to well aerated, moist condition under
low temperature \\(0^oC to 10^o C\\) for weeks
to months. Such treatment is called
**Stratification**.<br>
**iv. Alternating temperatures:** Germination
of some seeds is strongly promoted
by alternating daily temperatures. An
alternation of low and high temperature
improves the germination of seeds.<br>
**v. Light:** The dormancy of photoblastic seeds
can be broken by exposing them to red
light.<br>
#### 15.6 Senescence<br>
Plant life comprises some sequential events,
*viz*: germination, juvenile stage, maturation,
old age and death. Old age is called
*senescence* in plants. Senescence refers to
all collective, progressive and deteriorative
processes which ultimately lead to complete
loss of organization and function. Unlike
animals, plants continuously form new
organs and older organs undergo a highly
regulated senescence program to maximize
nutrient export.<br>
{{<box title="">}}
The branch of botany which deals with
ageing, abscission and senescence is called
**Phytogerontology**
{{</box>}}<br>
**1.Types of Senescence**<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/plant-growth-and-development/17.png)<br>
**Figure 15.13:** Different types of
senescence in plants <br>
**Leopold** (1961) has recognised four types of
senescence:<br>
i. Overall senescence<br>
ii. Top senescence<br>
iii. Deciduous senescence<br>
iv. Progressive senescence<br>
**i. Overall senescence:** This kind of
senescence occurs in annual plants
when entire plant gets affected and dies.
Example: Wheat and Soybean. It also
occurs in few perennials also. Example:
*Agave* and Bamboo.<br>
**ii.Top senescence:** It occurs in aerial parts
of plants. It is common in perennials,
underground and root system remains
viable. Example: Banana and *Gladiolus*.<br>
**iii.Deciduous senescence:** It is common
in deciduous plants and occurs only in
leaves of plants, bulk of the stem and
root system remains alive. Example: Elm
and Maple.<br>
**iv.Progressive senescence:** This kind of
senescence is gradual. First it occurs in old
leaves followed by new leaves then stem
and finally root system. It is common in
annuals (Figure 15.13).<br>
**2. Physiology of Senescence**
• Cells undergo changes in structure.<br>
• Vacuole of the cell acts as lysosome and
secretes hydrolytic enzymes.<br>
• The starch content is decreased in the cells.<br>
• Photosynthesis is reduced due to loss of
chlorophyll accompanied by synthesis and
accumulation of anthocyanin pigments,
therefore the leaf becomes red.<br>
• There is a marked decrease in protein
content in the senescing organ.<br>
• RNA content of the leaf particularly rRNA level is decreased in the cells due to
increased activity of the enzyme RNAase.<br>
• DNA molecules in senescencing leaves
degenerate by the increased activity of
enzyme DNAase.<br>

**3.Factors affecting Senescence:**<br>
• ABA and ethylene accelerate senescence
while auxin and cytokinin retard senescence.<br>
• Nitrogen deficiency increases senescence
whereas nitrogen supply retards senescence.<br>
• High temperature accelerates senescence
but low temperature retards senescence.<br>
• Senescence is rapid in dark than in light.<br>
• Water stress leads to accumulation of ABA
leading to senescence.<br>
**4. Programmed cell death (PCD)**<br>
Senescence is controlled by plants own
genetic programme and death of the plant
or plant part consequent to senescence is
called **Programmed Cell Death**. In short
senescence of an individual cell is called **PCD.**
The proteolytic enzymes involving PCD in
plants are **phytaspases** and in animals are
**caspases**. The nutrients and other substrates
from senescing cells and tissues are remobilized
and reallocated to other parts of the plant that
survives. The protoplasts of developing xylem
vessels and tracheids die and disappear at
maturity to make them functionally efficient
to conduct water for transport. In aquatic
plants, aerenchyma is normally formed in
different parts of the plant such as roots and
stems which encloses large air spaces that are
created through PCD. In the development of
unisexual flowers, male and female flowers
are present in earlier stages, but only one
of these two completes its development while
other aborts through PCD (Figure 15.14).<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/plant-growth-and-development/18.png)<br>
**Figure 15.14:** Programmed cell death<br>
**5. Abscission**<br>
Abscission is a physiological process of
shedding of organs like leaves, flowers, fruits
and seeds from the parent plant body. When
these parts are removed the plant seals off
its vascular system to prevent loss of water
and nutrients. Final stage of senescence
is abscission. In temperate regions all the
leaves of deciduous plants fall in autumn
and give rise to naked appearance, then the
new leaves are developed in the subsequent
spring season. But in evergreen plants there
is gradual abscission of leaves, the older
leaves fall while new leaves are developed
continuously throughout the year<br>
**6. Morphological and Anatomical changes during abscission**<br>
Leaf abscission takes place at the base of
petiole which is marked internally by a
distinct zone of few layers of thin walled
cells arranged transversely. This zone is
called **abscission zone or abscission layer**.
An abscission layer is greenish-grey in
colour and is formed by rows of cells of 2 to
15 cells thick. The cells of abscission layer
separate due to dissolution of middle lamella
and primary wall of cells by the activity of
enzymes **pectinase** and **cellulase** resulting
in loosening of cells. Tyloses are also formed
blocking the conducting vessels. Degrading
of chlorophyll occur leading to the change
in the colour of leaves, leaf detachment
from the plant and leaf fall. After abscission,
outer layer of cells becomes suberized by the
development of periderm (Figure 15.15).<br>
![](/books/biology/unit-5/plant-growth-and-development/19.png)<br>
**Figure 15.15:** L.S of petiolar base showing
abscission layer<br>
**7. Hormones influencing abscission**<br>
All naturally occurring hormones influence
the process of abscission. Auxins and
cytokinins retard abscission, while abscisic
acid (ABA) and ethylene induce it.
**8. Significance of abscission**<br>
1. Abscission separates dead parts of the
plant, like old leaves and ripe fruits.<br>
2. It helps in dispersal of fruits and
continuing the life cycle of the plant.<br>
3. Abscission of leaves in deciduous plants
helps in water conservation during
summer.<br>
4. In lower plants, shedding of vegetative
parts like gemmae or plantlets help in
vegetative reproduction.<br>
`Summary`<br>
Growth occurs by cell division, cell
elongation and cell maturation. The first
phase is lag phase, the second is log phase
and the final phase is steady state phase. The
log phase is otherwise known as **exponential**
**phase**. The three phases are collectively
called Grand period of growth. Plant growth
and development are controlled by both
internal and external factors. The internal
factors are chemical substances called Plant
Growth Regulators (PGRs). The hormones
are classified into five groups: Auxins,
gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid and
ethylene. These PGRs are synthesized
in various parts of the plant. PGRs may
act synergistically or antagonistically.
Mechanism of flowering is controlled by light
period (photoperiodism) and temperature
(vernalization). The physiological changes
on flowering with effect from relative length
of light and darkness (photoperiodism) are
called photoperiodism. A bluish biliprotein
responsible for the perception of light in
photophysiological process (induction
and inhibition of flowering) is called
**Phytochrome**. Besides photoperiod certain
plants require a low temperature in the
earlier stages for flowering. Many biennial
and perennial plants are induced to flower by
low temperature \\(0^oC to 5^oC\\). This process is
called **vernalization** and the reversal effect
of vernalization is called **devernalization**.
The condition of a seed when it fails to
germinate even in suitable environmental
condition is called **seed dormancy**. Thus,
dormancy can be overcome by following
methods such as scarification, impaction,
stratification, alternating temperatures and
light. Senescence refers to all collective,
progressive and deteriorative processes
which ultimately lead to complete loss of
organization and function. Senescence is of
four types and they are overall, top, deciduous
and progressive. Senescence is controlled by
plant’s own genetic programme. Death of the
plant or its parts consequent to senescence
is called **Programmed Cell Death (PCD)**.
The final stage of senescence is abscission.
Abscission is a physiological process of
shedding of organs from the parent plant
body.<br>
