A legendary Role model for women in
science. She was a scintillating Botany
teacher and pioneering researcher for six
decades. Her classic book Anatomy of
Seed Plants is the best
literature in Plant Anatomy.
In recognition of her
distinguished service to
science, she was awarded
National Medal of Science
(1989) by USA.

Chapter Outline
The learner will be able to,
• Study major types of plant tissues and
their functions.
• Describes the various type of tissue
system
• Interpret cross sections and longitudinal
sections of dicot and monocot root,
stem and leaf.
• Compare the internal organization of
dicot root and monocot root.

This chapter introduces the internal structure
of higher plants. The study of internal
structure and organisation of plant is called
Plant Anatomy (Gk: Ana = as under; temnein
= to cut). Plants have cells as the basic unit. The
cells are organised into tissues. The tissues in
turn are organised into organs. The different
organs in a plant have different internal
structures. It is studied by means of dissection
and microscopic examination.

The Tissues
A Tissue is a group of cells that are alike in
origin, structure and function. The study of
tissues is called Histology. A plant is made up
of different types of tissues.
There are two principal groups:
1. Meristematic tissues
2. Permanent tissues

#### 9.1 Meristematic Tissue
9.1.1 Characteristics and classification
The characters of meristematic tissues:
(Gr. Meristos-Divisible)

Figure 9.1: Different types of meristems on
the basis of position in plant body
The term meristem was coined by
C. Nageli 1858.

• The meristematic cells are isodiametric
and they may be, oval, spherical or
polygonal in shape.
• They generally have dense cytoplasm with
prominent nucleus.
• Generally the vacuoles are either small or
absent.
• Their cell wall is thin, elastic and made up
of cellulose.

• They generally have dense cytoplasm with
prominent nucleus.
• Generally the vacuoles are either small or

• Their cell wall is thin, elastic and made up 
of cellulose.
• These are most actively dividing cells.
• Meristematic cells are self-perpetuating.

Classification of Meristem

Meristem has been classified into several
types on the basis of position, origin,
function and division.

Theories of Meristem Organization and Function

Many anatomists illustrated the root
and shoot apical meristems on the basis
of number and arrangement and accordingly
proposed the following theories – An extract
of which is discussed below.
Shoot Apical Meristem
Apical Cell Theory
Apical cell theory is proposed by Hofmeister
(1852) and supported by Nageli (1859).
A single apical cell is the structural and
functional unit.

c) Shoot Tunica corpus theory
![](/books/biology/unit-4/Tissue and Tissue/07.png)


This apical cell governs the growth
and development of whole plant body. It is
applicable in Algae, Bryophytes and in some
Pteridophytes.

Histogen Theory

Histogen Theory
Histogen theory is proposed by Hanstein
(1868) and supported by Strassburgur. The
shoot apex comprises three distinct zones.

1. Dermatogen: It is the outermost layer.
It gives rise to epidermis.
2. Periblem: It is middle layer. That gives rise
to cortex.
3. Plerome: It is innermost layer. Which
gives rise to stele.

Tunica Corpus Theory

Tunica corpus theory is proposed by
A. Schmidt (1924).

Two zones of tissues are found in apical
meris tem.

1. The tunica: It is the peripheral zone of
shoot apex, that forms epidermis.


2. The corpus: It is the inner zone of shoot
apex,that forms cortex and stele of shoot.

Root Apical Meristem

Root apex is present opposite to the shoot
apex. The roots contain root cap at their apices
and the apical meristem is present below the
root cap. The different theories proposed to
explain root apical meristem organization are
given below.

Apical Cell Theory

Apical cell theory is proposed by Nageli. The
single apical cell or apical initial composes the
root meristem. The apical initial is tetrahedral
in shape and produces root cap from one side.
The remaining three sides produce epidermis,
cortex and vascular tissues. It is found in
vascular cryptogams.

Histogen Theory
Histogen theory is proposed by Hanstein
(1868) and supported by Strassburgur. The
histogen theory as appilied to the root 
apical meristem speaks of four histogen in the
meristem. They are respectively,

c) Quiescent Centre Concept

i. Dermatogen: It is the outermost layer. It
gives rise to root epidermis.

ii. Periblem: It is the middle layer. It gives rise
to cortex.

iii. Plerome: It is innermost layer. It gives rise
to stele

iv. Calyptrogen: It gives rise to root cap.
##### Korper Kappe Theory

Korper Kappe theory is proposed by
Schuepp. There are two zones in root apex
– Korper and Kappe

1. Korper zone forms the body.
2. Kappe zone forms the cap.This theory is equivalent to tunica corpus theory of shoot
apex.The two divisions are distinguished
by the type of T (also called Y) divisions.
Korper is characterised by inverted T
divisions and kappe by straight T divisions.

Quiescent Centre Concept

Quiescent centre concept was proposed by
Clowes (1961) to explain root apical meristem
activity. This centre is located between root
cap and differentiating cells of the roots. The
apparently inactive region of cells in root
promeristem is called quiescent centre. It is the
site of hormone synthesis and also the ultimate
source of all meristematic cells of the meristem.

###### 9.2 Permanent Tissues
The Permanent tissues develop from apical
meristem. They lose the power of cell division
either permanently or temporarily. They are
classified into two types:
1. Simple permanent tissues.
2. Complex permanent tissues.

##### Simple Permanent Tissues
Simple tissues are composed of one type
of cells only. The cells are structurally and
functionally similar. It is of three types.
1. Parenchyma
2. Collenchyma
3. Sclerenchyma
Parenchyma (Gk: Para-beside; enehein- to pour)
Parenchyma is generally present in all organs
of the plant. It forms the ground tissue in a
plant. Parenchyma is a living tissue and made
up of thin walled cells. The cell wall is made
up of cellulose. Parenchyma cells may be oval,
polyhedral, cylindrical, irregular, elongated
or armed. The tissue normally has prominent
intercellular spaces and may store various types
of materials like, water, air, ergastic substances.
