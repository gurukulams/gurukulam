And embryonic development
The inner cell mass in the blastula is
differentiated into epiblast and hypoblast
immediately after implantation. The hypoblast
is the embryonic endoderm and the epiblast is the ectoderm. The cells remaining in
between the epiblast and the endoderm form
the mesoderm. Thus the transformation of the
blastocyst into a gastrula with the primary germ
layers by the movement of the blastomeres is
called gastrulation. Each germ layer gives rise
to specific tissues, organs and organ systems
during organogenesis.
The extra embryonic membranes namely
the amnion, yolk sac, allantois and chorion
protect the embryo from dessication, mechanical
shock and help in the absorption of nutrients
and exchange of gases (Fig. 2.12). The amnion
is a double layered translucent membrane filled
with the amniotic fluid. It provides a buoyant
environment to protect the developing embryo
from injury, regulates the temperature of the
foetus and provides a medium in which the
foetus can move. The yolk sac forms a part of
the gut and is the source of the earliest blood
cells and blood vessels.

The allantois forms a small out pocketing
of embryonic tissue at the caudal end of the yolk
sac. It is the structural base for the umbilical
cord that links the embryo to the placenta and
ultimately it becomes part of the urinary bladder.
The chorion is the outermost membrane which
encloses the embryo and all other membranes
and also helps in the formation of the placenta.
The trophoblast cells in the blastocyst
send out several finger like projections called chorionic villi carrying foetal blood and are
surrounded by sinuses that contain maternal
blood. The chorionic villi and the uterine
tissues form the disc-shaped placenta. Placenta
is a temporary endocrine organ formed during
pregnancy and it connects the foetus to the
uterine wall through the umbilical cord. It is
the organ by which the nutritive, respiratory
and excretory functions are fulfilled. The
embryoâ€™s heart develops during the fourth week
of pregnancy and circulates blood through the
umbilical cord and placenta as well as through
its own tissues.
The primary germ layers serve as the
primitive tissues from which all body organs
develop. The ectoderm gives rise to the central
nervous system (brain and spinal cord),
peripheral nervous system, epidermis and
its derivatives and mammary glands. The
connective tissue, cartilage and bone, muscles,
organs of urinogenital system (kidney, ureter
and gonads) arise from the mesoderm. The
endodermal derivatives are epithelium of
gastrointestinal and respiratory tract, liver,
pancreas, thyroid and parathyroids.
Human pregnancy lasts for about 280
days or 40 weeks and is called the gestation
period. It can be divided for convenience into
three trimesters of three months each. The first
trimester is the main period of organogenesis,
the body organs namely the heart, limbs,
lungs, liver and external genital organs are well
developed. By the end of the second trimester,
the face is well formed with features, eyelids and
eyelashes, eyes blink, body is covered with fine
hair, muscle tissue develops and bones become
harder. The foetus is fully developed and is
ready for delivery by the end of nine months
(third trimester).
During pregnancy, the placenta acts as
a temporary endocrine gland and produces
large quantities of human Chorionic
Gonadotropin (hCG), human Chorionic
Somatomammotropin (hCS) or human Placental Lactogen (hPL), oestrogens and
progesterone which are essential for a normal
pregnancy. A hormone called relaxin is also
secreted during the later phase of pregnancy
which helps in relaxation of the pelvic ligaments
at the time of parturition. It should be noted that
hCG, hPL and relaxin are produced only during
pregnancy. In addition, during pregnancy the
level of other hormones like oestrogen and
progesterone, cortisol, prolactin, thyroxine, etc.,
is increased several folds in the maternal blood.
These hormones are essential for supporting
foetal growth.

A female uterus is
normally about 3 inches
long and 2 inches wide
but can expand 20 times
during pregnancy.
