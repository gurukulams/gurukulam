Sexual reproduction involves the fusion
of male and female gametes to form a diploid zygote, which develops into
a new organism. It leads to genetic variation. The types
of sexual reproduction seen in animals are syngamy
(fertilization) and conjugation. **In syngamy,** the fusion of two
haploid gametes takes place to produce a diploid
zygote. Depending upon the place where the
fertilization takes place, it is of two types. In
**external fertilization**, the fusion of male and
female gametes takes place outside the body
of female organisms in the water medium.
e.g. sponges, fishes and amphibians. In **internal fertilization**, the fusion of male and female
gametes takes place within the body of female
organisms. e.g. reptiles, aves and mammals.

Sponge when macerated
and squeezed through
fine silk cloth, the cluster of cells pass
through, and these can regenerate new
sponges. This technique is used for
cultivation of sponges.

Different kinds of syngamy (fertilization)
are prevalent among living organisms.

a) **Autogamy**- The male and female
gametes are produced by the same cell or same
organism and both the gametes fuse together
to form a zygote. e.g. Actinosphaerium and
Paramecium.

b) **Exogamy**- The male and female gametes
are produced by different parents and they fuse
to form a zygote. So it is biparental. e.g. Human
– dioecious or unisexual animal.

c) **Hologamy**- Lower organisms,
sometimes the entire mature organisms do not
form gametes but they themselves behave as
gametes and the fusion of such mature individuals
is known as hologamy e.g. Trichonympha.

d) **Paedogamy**- It is the sexual union of
young individuals produced immediately after
the division of the adult parent cell by mitosis.

e) **Merogamy**- The fusion of small
sized and morphologically different gametes
(merogametes) takes place.

f) **Isogamy**- The fusion of morphological
and physiological identical gametes
(isogametes) is called isogamy. e.g. Monocystis.

g) **Anisogamy**- The fusion of dissimilar
gametes is called anisogamy (Gr. An-without;
iso-equal; gam-marriage). Anisogamy occurs
in higher animals but it is customary to use
the term fertilization instead of anisogamy
or syngamy. e.g. higher invertebrates and all
vertebrates.

Conjugation is the temporary union of the
two individuals of the same species. During their
union both individuals, called the conjugants
exchange certain amount of nuclear material
(DNA) and then get separated. Conjugation
is common among ciliates, e.g. Paramecium,
Vorticella and bacteria (Prokaryotes).

**Phases of life cycle:**

 Organisms have three phases – Juvenile phase, reproductive phase and
senescent phase. **Juvenile phase/ vegetative**
**phase** is the period of growth between the birth
of the individual upto reproductive maturity.
During **reproductive phase/ maturity phase**
the organisms reproduce and their offsprings
reach maturity period. On the basis of time,
breeding animals are of two types: **seasonal breeders and continuous breeders**. Seasonal
breeders reproduce at particular period of
the year such as frogs, lizards, most birds,
deers etc., Continuous breeders continue to
breed throughout their sexual maturity e.g.
honey bees, poultry, rabbit etc., **Senescent phase** begins at the end of reproductive phase
when degeneration sets in the structure and
functioning of the body.



**PARTHENOGENESIS**

**(Gr. Parthenos – virgin, Genesis-produce)**

Development of an egg into a complete
individual without fertilization is known as
parthenogenesis. It was first discovered by
Charles Bonnet in 1745. Parthenogenesis is of
two main types namely, Natural Parthenogenesis
and Artificial Parthenogenesis. In certain
animals, parthenogenesis occurs regularly,
constantly and naturally in their life cycle and
is known as **natural parthenogenesis.**

{{< box title=" Natural parthenogenesis are of different types:" type="objective">}}

a) **Arrhenotoky**: In this type
only males are produced by parthenogenesis.
e.g. honey bees

b) **Thelytoky**: In this type only females are
produced by parthenogenesis. e.g. Solenobia

c) **Amphitoky**: In this type parthenogenetic
egg may develop into individuals of any sex.
e.g. Aphis

Natural parthenogenesis may be of
two types, viz., complete and incomplete.
**Complete parthenogenesis** is the only form
of reproduction in certain animals and there is
no biparental sexual reproduction. There are
no male organisms and so, such individuals
are represented by females only. **Incomplete parthenogenesis** is found in some animals
in which both sexual reproduction and
parthenogenesis occurs. e.g. In honeybees;
fertilized eggs (zygotes) develop into queen
and workers, whereas unfertilized eggs
develop into drones (male). In paedogenetic
parthenogenesis (paedogenesis) the larvae
produce a new generation of larvae by
parthenogenesis. It occurs in the sporocysts
and Redia larvae of liver fluke. It is also seen
in the larvae of some insects. e.g. Gall fly. In
**artificial parthenogenesis**, the unfertilized
egg (ovum) is induced to develop into a
complete individual by physical or chemical
stimuli. e.g., Annelid and seaurchin eggs.
