#### Fermentation

The word fermentation is derived from the
Latin verb ‘fervere’ which means ‘ to boil’.
Fermentation refers to the metabolic process
in which organic molecules (normally glucose)
are converted into acids, gases, or alcohol in
the absence of oxygen or any electron transport
chain. The study of fermentation, its practical
uses is called zymology and originated in
1856, when French chemist Louis Pasteur
demonstrated that fermentation was caused
by yeast. Fermentation occurs in certain types
of bacteria and fungi that require an oxygen-
free environment to live. The processes of
fermentation are valuable to the food and
beverage industries, with the conversion
of sugar into ethanol to produce alcoholic
beverages, the release of CO2 by yeast used in the
leavening of bread, and with the production of
organic acids to preserve and flavor vegetables
and dairy products.

###### Bioreactor (Fermentor)

Bioreactor (Fermentor) is a vessel or a
container that is designed in such a way that
it can provide an optimum environment in
which microorganisms or their enzymes
interact with a substrate to produce the
required product. In the bioreactor aeration,
agitation, temperature and pH are controlled.
Fermentation involves two process.

**i. Upstream process**

All the process before starting of the fermenter
such as sterilization of the fermenter,
preparation and sterilization of culture
medium and growth of the suitable inoculum
are called upstream process.

**ii. Downstream process**

All the process after the fermentation process
is known as the downstream process. This
process includes distillation, centrifuging,filtration and solvent extraction. Mostly
this process involves the purification of the
desired product.

##### Procedure of Fermentation


a. Depending upon the type of product, bioreactor is selected.

b. A suitable substrate in liquid medicine is
added at a specific temperature, pH and
then diluted.
The organism (microbe, animal/plant

c. cell, sub-cellular organelle or enzyme) is
added to it.
Then it is incubated at a specific

d. temperature for the specified time.

e. The incubation may either be aerobic or
anaerobic.

f. Withdrawal of product using downstream
processing methods

## Application of fermentation in industries

Fermentation has industrial application such as:

**1. Microbial biomass production**

Microbial cells (biomass) like algae, bacteria,
yeast, fungi are grown, dried and used as
source of a complete protein called ‘single cell
protein (SCP)’ which serves as human food or
animal feed.

**2. Microbial metabolites**

Microbes produce compounds that are very useful to man and animals. These compounds
called metabolites, can be grouped into two
categories:

**a. Primary metabolites:**

Metabolites produced for the maintenance of life
process of microbes are known as primary
metabolites Eg. Ethanol, citric, acid, lactic
acid, acetic acid.

**b. Secondary metabolites:**

Secondary
metabolites are those which are not
required for the vital life process of
microbes, but have value added nature, this
includes antibiotics e.g -Amphotericin-B
(Streptomyces
nodosus),
Penicillin
(Penicillium chryosogenum) Streptomycin
(S. grises) , Tetracycline (S. aureofacins),
alkaloids, toxic pigments, vitamins etc.

**3. Microbial enzymes**

When microbes are cultured, they secrete some enzymes into the growth media. These
enzymes are industrially used in detergents,
food processing, brewing and pharmaceuticals.
Eg. protease, amylase, isomerase, and lipase.

**4. Bioconversion, biotransformation or modification of the substrate**

The fermenting microbes have the capacity to
produce valuable products, eg. conversion of
ethanol to acetic acid (vinegar), isopropanol to
acetone, sorbitol to sorbose (this is used in the
manufacture of vitamin C), sterols to steroids.

#### Single Cell Protein (SCP)

Single cell proteins are dried cells of
microorganism that are used as protein
supplement in human foods or animal
feeds. Single Cell Protein (SCP) offers
an unconventional but plausible solution
to protein deficiency faced by the entire
humanity. Although single cell protein has
high nutritive value due to their higher
protein, vitamin, essential amino acids and
lipid content, there are doubts on whether it
could replace conventional protein sources due to its high nucleic acid content and
slower in digestibility. Microorganisms used
for the production of Single Cell Protein are
as follows:

- Bacteria - Methylophilus methylotrophus, Cellulomonas, Alcaligenes

- Fungi - Agaricus campestris, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Candida utilis

- Algae - Spirulina, Chlorella, Chlamydomonas

The single cell protein forms an important
source of food because of their protein content,
carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals. It is
used by Astronauts and Antarctica expedition
scientists.

Spirulina
can
be grown easily on
materials like waste
water from potato
processing
plants
(containing starch),
straw,
molasses,
animal manure and
even sewage, to produce large quantities and
can serve as food rich in protein, minerals, fats,
carbohydrate and vitamins. Such utilization
also reduces environmental pollution. 250 g
of Methylophilus methylotrophus, with a high
rate of biomass production and growth, can
be expected to produce 25 tonnes of protein.

**Applications of Single-Cell Protein**

- It is used as protein supplement

- It is used in cosmetics products for healthy hair and skin

- It is used as the excellent source of protein for feeding cattle, birds, fishes etc.

- It is used in food industry as aroma carriers, vitamin carrier, emulsifying agents to improve the nutritive value of baked products, in soups, in  ready-to-serve-meals, in diet recipes

- It is used in industries like paper processing, leather processing as foam stabilizers.
