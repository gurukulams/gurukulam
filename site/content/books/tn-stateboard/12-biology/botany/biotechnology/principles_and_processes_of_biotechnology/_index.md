Biotechnology is the science of applied biological processes. In other words it is science of development and utilization of biological processes, forms and systems for the benefit of mankind and other life forms. The term biotechnology was coined by Karl Ereky, a Hungarian Engineer in 1919 and has been extended to include any process in which organisms, tissues, cells ,organelles or isolated molecules such as enzymes are used to convert biological or other raw materials to products of greater value.

### Development of Biotechnology

Biotechnology has developed by leaps and bounds during the past century and its development can be well understood under two main heads namely **conventional or traditional biotechnology and modern biotechnology** 

**1. Conventional or traditional biotechnology:** 

This is the kitchen technology developed by our ancestors, and it is as old as human civilization. It uses bacteria and other microbes in the daily usage for preparation of dairy products like curd, ghee, cheese and in preparation of foods like idli, dosa, nan, bread and pizza. This conventional biotechnology also extends to preparation of alcoholic beverages like beer, wine, etc. With the advancement of the science and technology during the 18th century, these kitchen technologies gained scientific validation.

**2. Modern biotechnology**

There are two main features of this technology,
that differentiated it from the conventional
technology they are i) ability to change the
genetic material for getting new products with
specific requirement through recombinant
DNA technology ii) ownership of the newly
developed technology and its social impact.
Today, biotechnology is a billion dollar business
around the world, where in pharmaceutical
companies, breweries, agro industries and
other biotechnology based industries apply
biotechnological tools for their product
improvement.

Modern biotechnology embraces all methods
of genetic modification by recombinant DNA
and cell fusion technology. The major focus of
biotechnology are

- **Fermentation** for production of acids,
enzymes, alcohols, antibiotics, fine
chemicals, vitamins and toxins

- **Biomass for** bulk production of single cell
protein , alcohol, and biofuel

- **Enzymes** as biosensors, in processing
industry

- **Biofuels** for production of hydrogen,
alcohol, methane

- **Microbial inoculants** as biofertiliser, and
nitrogen fixers

- **Plant and animal cell culture** for production
of secondary metabolites, monoclonal
antibodies

- **Recombinant DNA technology** for production of fine chemicals, enzymes,
vaccines, growth hormones, antibiotics, and
interferon

- **Process engineering** – tools of
biotechnology is used for effluent treatment,
water recycling.
This unit will reveal the various aspects of
modern biotechnology, its products and
applications.


#### 4.3. Methods of Biotechnology

#### Fermentation

The word fermentation is derived from the
Latin verb ‘fervere’ which means ‘ to boil’.
Fermentation refers to the metabolic process
in which organic molecules (normally glucose)
are converted into acids, gases, or alcohol in
the absence of oxygen or any electron transport
chain. The study of fermentation, its practical
uses is called zymology and originated in
1856, when French chemist Louis Pasteur
demonstrated that fermentation was caused
by yeast. Fermentation occurs in certain types
of bacteria and fungi that require an oxygen-
free environment to live. The processes of
fermentation are valuable to the food and
beverage industries, with the conversion
of sugar into ethanol to produce alcoholic
beverages, the release of CO2 by yeast used in the
leavening of bread, and with the production of
organic acids to preserve and flavor vegetables
and dairy products.

###### Bioreactor (Fermentor)

Bioreactor (Fermentor) is a vessel or a
container that is designed in such a way that
it can provide an optimum environment in
which microorganisms or their enzymes
interact with a substrate to produce the
required product. In the bioreactor aeration,
agitation, temperature and pH are controlled.
Fermentation involves two process.

**i. Upstream process**

All the process before starting of the fermenter
such as sterilization of the fermenter,
preparation and sterilization of culture
medium and growth of the suitable inoculum
are called upstream process.

**ii. Downstream process**

All the process after the fermentation process
is known as the downstream process. This
process includes distillation, centrifuging,filtration and solvent extraction. Mostly
this process involves the purification of the
desired product.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/4.2.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}

###### Procedure of Fermentation


a. Depending upon the type of product, bioreactor is selected.

b. A suitable substrate in liquid medicine is
added at a specific temperature, pH and
then diluted.
The organism (microbe, animal/plant

c. cell, sub-cellular organelle or enzyme) is
added to it.
Then it is incubated at a specific

d. temperature for the specified time.

e. The incubation may either be aerobic or
anaerobic.

f. Withdrawal of product using downstream
processing methods

## Application of fermentation in industries

Fermentation has industrial application such as:

**1. Microbial biomass production**

Microbial cells (biomass) like algae, bacteria,
yeast, fungi are grown, dried and used as
source of a complete protein called ‘single cell
protein (SCP)’ which serves as human food or
animal feed.

**2. Microbial metabolites**

Microbes produce compounds that are very useful to man and animals. These compounds
called metabolites, can be grouped into two
categories:

**a. Primary metabolites:**

Metabolites produced for the maintenance of life
process of microbes are known as primary
metabolites Eg. Ethanol, citric, acid, lactic
acid, acetic acid.

**b. Secondary metabolites:**

Secondary
metabolites are those which are not
required for the vital life process of
microbes, but have value added nature, this
includes antibiotics e.g -Amphotericin-B
(Streptomyces
nodosus),
Penicillin
(Penicillium chryosogenum) Streptomycin
(S. grises) , Tetracycline (S. aureofacins),
alkaloids, toxic pigments, vitamins etc.

**3. Microbial enzymes**

When microbes are cultured, they secrete some enzymes into the growth media. These
enzymes are industrially used in detergents,
food processing, brewing and pharmaceuticals.
Eg. protease, amylase, isomerase, and lipase.

**4. Bioconversion, biotransformation or modification of the substrate**

The fermenting microbes have the capacity to
produce valuable products, eg. conversion of
ethanol to acetic acid (vinegar), isopropanol to
acetone, sorbitol to sorbose (this is used in the
manufacture of vitamin C), sterols to steroids.

#### Single Cell Protein (SCP)

Single cell proteins are dried cells of
microorganism that are used as protein
supplement in human foods or animal
feeds. Single Cell Protein (SCP) offers
an unconventional but plausible solution
to protein deficiency faced by the entire
humanity. Although single cell protein has
high nutritive value due to their higher
protein, vitamin, essential amino acids and
lipid content, there are doubts on whether it
could replace conventional protein sources due to its high nucleic acid content and
slower in digestibility. Microorganisms used
for the production of Single Cell Protein are
as follows:

- Bacteria - Methylophilus methylotrophus, Cellulomonas, Alcaligenes

- Fungi - Agaricus campestris, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Candida utilis

- Algae - Spirulina, Chlorella, Chlamydomonas

The single cell protein forms an important
source of food because of their protein content,
carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals. It is
used by Astronauts and Antarctica expedition
scientists.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/4.3.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}

Spirulina
can
be grown easily on
materials like waste
water from potato
processing
plants
(containing starch),
straw,
molasses,
animal manure and
even sewage, to produce large quantities and
can serve as food rich in protein, minerals, fats,
carbohydrate and vitamins. Such utilization
also reduces environmental pollution. 250 g
of Methylophilus methylotrophus, with a high
rate of biomass production and growth, can
be expected to produce 25 tonnes of protein.

**Applications of Single-Cell Protein**

- It is used as protein supplement

- It is used in cosmetics products for healthy hair and skin

- It is used as the excellent source of protein for feeding cattle, birds, fishes etc.

- It is used in food industry as aroma carriers, vitamin carrier, emulsifying agents to improve the nutritive value of baked products, in soups, in  ready-to-serve-meals, in diet recipes

- It is used in industries like paper processing, leather processing as foam stabilizers.

### Advancements in Modern Biotechnology

Modern biotechnology embraces all the
genetic manipulations, protoplasmic fusion
techniques and the improvements made in
the old biotechnological processes. Some
of the major advancements in modern
biotechnology are described below.

#### Genetic Engineering

Genetic engineering or recombinant DNA
technology or gene cloning is a collective term
that includes different experimental protocols
resulting in the modification and transfer of
DNA from one organism to another.

The definition for conventional
recombination was already given in Unit
II. Conventional recombination involves
exchange or recombination of genes between
homologous chromosomes during meiosis.
Recombination carried out artificially using
modern technology is called recombinant
DNA technology (r-DNA technology). It is
also known as gene manipulation technique.
This technique involves the transfer of DNA
coding for a specific gene from one organism
into another organism using specific
agents like vectors or using instruments
like electroporation, gene gun, liposome
mediated, chemical mediated transfers and
microinjection.

#### Steps involved in Recombinant DNA Technology 

**The steps involved in recombinant DNA technology are:**

- Isolation of a DNA fragment containing a gene of interest that needs to be cloned. This is called an insert. 

PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction is a common
laboratory technique used to make copies
(millions) of a particular region of DNA.

- Generation of recombinant DNA (rDNA) molecule by insertion of the DNA fragment into a carrier molecule called a vector that can self-replicate within the host cell.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/4.4.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}
- Selection of the transformed host cells is carrying the rDNA and allowing them to multiply thereby multiplying the rDNA molecule.

- The entire process thus generates either a large amount of rDNA or a large amount of protein expressed by the insert.

- Wherever vectors are not involved the desired gene is multiplied by PCR technique. The multiple copies are injected into the host cell protoplast or it is shot into the host cell protoplast by shot gun method.

### Tools for Genetic Engineering

In order to generate recombinant DNA molecule, certain basic tools are necessary. The basic tools
are enzymes, vectors and host
organisms. The most important
enzymes required for genetic
engineering are the restriction
enzymes, DNA ligase and
alkaline phosphatase.

#### Restriction Enzymes

The two enzymes responsible
for restricting the growth of
bacteriophage in Escherichia coli
were isolated in the year 1963.
One was the enzyme which added
methyl groups to DNA, while the
other cut DNA. The latter was
called restriction endonuclease.
A  **restriction**  enzyme
or  **restriction endonuclease**  is
an enzyme that cleaves DNA
into fragments at or near
specific recognition sites
within the molecule known
as  **restriction**  sites. Based on
their mode of action restriction
enzymes are classified into Exonucleases and
Endonucleases.

a. Exonucleases are enzymes which remove
nucleotides one at a time from the end of a
DNA molecule. e.g. Bal 31, Exonuclease III.

b. Endonucleases are enzymes which break
the internal phosphodiester bonds within a DNA molecule. e.g. Hind II, EcoRI, Pvul,
BamHI, TaqI.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/table_1.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}


### Restriction endonucleases: Molecular scissors

The restriction enzymes are called as molecular
scissors. These act as foundation of recombinant
DNA technology. These enzymes exist in
many bacteria where they function as a part
of their defence mechanism called restrictionmodification system.

There are three main classes of restriction
endonucleases: Type I, Type II and Type III,
which differ slightly by their mode of action.
Only type II enzyme is preferred for use in
recombinant DNA technology as they recognise
and cut DNA within a specific sequence
typically consisting of 4-8 bp. Examples of
certain enzymes are given in table 5.1.

The restriction enzyme **Hind II** always cut
DNA molecules at a point of recognising a
specific sequence of six base pairs. This sequence
is known as recognition sequence. Today
more than 900 restriction enzymes have been
isolated from over 230 strains of bacteria with
different recognition sequences. This sequence
is referred to as a restriction site and is generally
–palindromic which means that the sequence in
both DNA strands at this site read same in 5’ – 3’
direction and in the 3’-5’ direction

Example: MALAYALAM: This phrase is
read the same in either of the directions.

**Palindromic repeats:** A symmetrical
repeated sequence in DNA strands

 5’ ... CATTATATAATG ... 3’
 3’ ... GTAATATATTAC ... 5’

Note: That the sequence of the base pairs in
the reverse direction when compare to the
first sequence.

Restriction endonucleases are named by a
standard procedure. The first letter of the enzymes
indicates the genus name, followed by the first
two letters of the species, then comes the strain
of the organism and finally a roman numeral 

indicating the order of discovery. For example,
**EcoRI** is from Escherichia (**E**) coli (**co**), strain RY
13 (**R**) and first endonuclease (**I**) to be discovered.
The exact kind of cleavage produced by a
restriction enzyme is important in the design
of a gene cloning experiment. Some cleave both
strands of DNA through the centre resulting
in **blunt** or **flush end**. These are known as
symmetric cuts. Some enzymes cut in a way
producing protruding and recessed ends known
as **sticky** or **cohesive end**. Such cut are called
staggered or asymmetric cuts

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/4.5.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}

Two other enzymes that play an important
role in recombinant DNA technology are
DNA ligase and alkaline phosphatase

#### DNA Ligase

DNA ligase enzyme joins the sugar and
phosphate molecules of double stranded
DNA (dsDNA) with 5’-PO4 and a 3’-OH in
an Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) dependent
reaction. This is isolated from T4 phage.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/4.6.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}

#### Alkaline Phosphatase

It is a DNA modifying enzyme and adds
or removes specific phosphate group at 5’
terminus of double stranded DNA (dsDNA) or single stranded DNA (ssDNA) or RNA. Thus it
prevents self ligation. This enzyme is purified
from bacteria and calf intestine.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/4.7.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}

#### Vectors

Another major component of a gene cloning
experiment is a vector such as a plasmid. A
Vector is a small DNA molecule capable of
self-replication and is used as a carrier and
transporter of DNA fragment which is inserted
into it for cloning experiments. Vector is
also called **cloning vehicle** or **cloning DNA**.
Vectors are of two types: i) Cloning Vector, and
ii) Expression Vector. Cloning vector is used for the
cloning of DNA insert inside the suitable host cell.
Expression vector is used to express the DNA insert
for producing specific protein inside the host.

##### Properties of Vectors

Vectors are able to replicate autonomously to
produce multiple copies of them along with
their DNA insert in the host cell.

- It should be small in size and of low molecular
weight, less than 10 Kb (kilo base pair) in size
so that entry/transfer into host cell is easy.

- Vector must contain an origin of replication
so that it can independetly replicate within
the host.

- It should contain a suitable marker such as antibiotic resistance, to permit its detection
in transformed host cell.

- Vector should have unique target sites for
integration with DNA insert and should
have the ability to integrate with DNA
insert it carries into the genome of the host
cell. Most of the commonly used cloning
vectors have more than one restriction site.
These are Multiple Cloning Site (MCS) or
polylinker. Presence of MCS facilitates the
use of restriction enzyme of choice

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/img1.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}

The following are the features that are required
to facilitate cloning into a vector.

1. **Origin of replication (ori):** This is a
sequence from where replication starts
and piece of DNA when linked to this
sequence can be made to replicate within
the host cells

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/4.8.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}

2. **Selectable marker**: In addition to ori the
vector requires a selectable marker, which
helps in identifying and eliminating non
transformants and selectively permitting
the growth of the transformants.

3. **Cloning sites**: In order to link the alien
DNA, the vector needs to have very few,
preferably single, recognition sites for the
commonly used restriction enzymes.

##### Types of vector

Few types of vectors are discussed in detail below:

**Plasmid**

Plasmids are extra
c h r o m o s o m a l ,
self replicating ds
circular DNA molecules, found in the bacterial
cells in addition to the bacterial chromosome.
Plasmids contain Genetic information for their
own replication.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/4.9.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}

**pBR 322 Plasmid**

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/4.10.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}

pBR 322 plasmid is a reconstructed plasmid
and most widely used as cloning vector; it
contains 4361 base pairs. In pBR, ***p*** denotes 
plasmid, **B**and **R** respectively the names of
scientist **B**oliver and **R**odriguez who developed
this plasmid. The number **322** is the number
of plasmid developed from their laboratory. It
contains amp<sup>R</sup> and tet<sup>R</sup> two different antibiotic
resistance genes and recognition sites for several
restriction enzymes. (Hind III, EcoRI, BamH
I, Sal I, Pvu II, Pst I, Cla I), ori and antibiotic
resistance genes. Rop codes for the proteins
involved in the replication of the plasmid.


**Ti Plasmid Bacteria**

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/4.11.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}

Ti plasmid is found
in Agrobacterium
tumefaciens, a bacteria
responsible for
inducing tumours
in several dicot
plants. The plasmid
carries transfer (tra)
gene which help to transfer T- DNA from one
bacterium to other bacterial or plant cell. It has
Onc gene for oncogenecity, ori gene for origin
for replication and inc gene for incompatibility.
T-DNA of Ti-Plasmid is stably integrated with
plant DNA. Agrobacterium plasmids have been
used for introduction of genes of desirable traits
into plants.

#### Competent Host (For Transformation with Recombinant DNA)

The propagation of the recombinant DNA
molecules must occur inside a living system or
host. Many types of host cells are available for
gene cloning which includes E.coli, yeast, animal
or plant cells. The type of host cell depends
upon the cloning experiment. E.coli is the most
widely used organism as its genetic make-up
has been extensively studied, it is easy to handle and grow, can accept a range of
vectors and has also been studied
for safety. One more important
feature of E.coli to be preferred as
a host cell is that under optimal
growing conditions the cells divide
every 20 minutes. 

Since the DNA is a hydrophilic
molecule,it cannot pass through
cell membranes, In order to force
bacteria to take up the plasmid,
the bacterial cells must first be
made competent to take up DNA.
This is done by treating them with
a specific concentration of a divalent cation
such as calcium. Recombinant DNA can then
be forced into such cells by incubating the cells
with recombinant DNA on ice, followed by
placing them briefly at 42<sup>0</sup>C (heatshock) and then putting them back on ice. This enables
bacteria to take up the Recombinant DNA.

For the expression of eukaryotic proteins,
eukaryotic cells are preferred because to produce
a functionally active protein it should fold
properly and post translational modifications
should also occur, which is not possible by
prokaryotic cell (E.coli).

### Methods of Gene Transfer

The next step after a recombinant DNA molecule
has been generated is to introduce it into a
suitable host cell. There are many methods to
introduce recombinant vectors and these are
dependent on several factors such as the vector
type and host cell.

For achieving genetic transformation in
plants, the basic pre-requisite is the construction
of a vector which carries the gene of interest
flanked by the necessary controlling sequences,
i.e., the promoter and terminator, and deliver the
genes into the host plant. There are two kinds of
gene transfer methods in plants. It includes:

- Direct or vectorless gene transfer

- Indirect or vector – mediated gene transfer


#### Direct or Vectorless Gene Transfer

In the direct gene transfer methods, the foreign
gene of interest is delivered into the host plant
without the help of a vector. The following are
some of the common methods of direct gene
transfer in plants.

**a. Chemical mediated gene transfer:**
Certain chemicals like polyethylene glycol
(PEG) and dextran sulphate induce DNA
uptake into plant protoplasts.

**b. Microinjection:**
The DNA is directly injected
into the nucleus using fine tipped glass needle
or micro pipette to transform plant cells.
The protoplasts are immobilised on a solid
support (agarose on a microscopic slide) or
held with a holding pipette under suction.

**c. Electroporation Methods of Gene Transfer**:

A pulse of high voltage is applied
to protoplasts, cells or tissues which makes
transient pores in the plasma membrane
through which uptake of foreign DNA
occurs.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/4.14.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}

**d. Liposome mediated method of Gene Transfer**: Liposomes the artificial
phospholipid vesicles are useful in gene
transfer. The gene or DNA is transferred
from liposome into vacuole of plant
cells. It is carried out by encapsulated
DNA into the vacuole. This technique
is advantageous because the liposome
protects the introduced DNA from being
damaged by the acidic pH and protease
enzymes present in the vacuole. Liposome
and tonoplast of vacuole fusion resulted
in gene transfer. This process is called
lipofection.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/4.15.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}

**e. Biolistics:** The foreign DNA is coated onto
the surface of minute gold or tungsten
particles (1-3 µm) and bombarded onto
the target tissue or cells using a particle gun
(also called as gene gun/micro projectile
gun/shotgun). Then the bombarded cells
or tissues are cultured on selected medium to regenerate plants from the transformed
cells.(Figure 4.16)

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/4.16.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}

#### Indirect or Vector-Mediated Gene Transfer

Gene transfer is mediated with the help of a
plasmid vector is known as indirect or vector
mediated gene transfer. Among the various
vectors used for plant transformation, the
Ti-plasmid from Agrobacterium tumefaciens
has been used extensively. This bacterium
has a large size plasmid, known as Ti
plasmid (Tumor inducing) and a portion
of it referred as T-DNA (transfer DNA) is
transferred to plant genome in the infected
cells and cause plant tumors (crown gall).
Since this bacterium has the natural ability
to transfer T-DNA region of its plasmid into
plant genome, upon infection of cells at the
wound site, it is also known as the natural
genetic engineer of plants.

The foreign gene (e.g. Bt gene for insect
resistance) and plant selection marker
gene, usually an antibiotic gene like npt
II which confers resistance to antibiotic
kanamycin are cloned in the T DNA region
of Ti-plasmid in place of unwanted DNA
sequences.(Figure 4.17)

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/4.17.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}

### Screening for Recombinants

After the introduction of r-DNA into a suitable
host cell, it is essential to identify those cells
which have received the r-DNA molecule. This process is called screening. The vector or foreign
DNA present in recombinant cells expresses the
characters, while the non-recombinants do not
express the characters or traits. For this some of
the methods are used and one such method is
Blue-White Colony Selection method.

#### Insertional Inactivation - BlueWhite Colony Selection Method

It is a powerful method used for screening
of recombinant plasmid. In this method, a
reporter gene **lacZ** is inserted in the vector.
The lacZ encodes the enzyme β-galactosidase
and contains several recognition sites for
restriction enzyme.

β-galactosidase breaks a synthetic substrate
called X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl-βD-galacto-pyranoside) into an insoluble blue
coloured product. If a foreign gene is inserted
into lacZ, this gene will be inactivated.
Therefore, no-blue colour will develop (white)
because β-galactosidase is not synthesized due
to inactivation of lacZ. Therefore, the host
cell containing r-DNA form white coloured
colonies on the medium contain X-gal, whereas
the other cells containing non-recombinant
DNA will develop the blue coloured colonies.
On the basis of colony colour, the recombinants
can be selected.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/4.18.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}

#### Antibiotic resistant markers

An antibiotic resistance marker is a gene
that produces a protein that provides cells
with resistance to an antibiotic. Bacteria
with transformed DNA can be identified by
growing on a medium containing an antibiotic.
Recombinants will grow on these media as they 
contain genes encoding resistance to antibiotics
such as  ampicillin, chloro amphenicol,
tetracycline or kanamycin, etc., while others
may not be able to grow in these media, hence it
is considered useful selectable marker.

##### 4.7.3. Replica plating technique

A technique in which the pattern of colonies
growing on a culture plate is copied. A sterile
filter plate is pressed against the culture plate
and then lifted. Then the filter is pressed against
a second sterile culture plate. This results in the
new plate being infected with cell in the same
relative positions as the colonies in the original
plate. Usually, the medium used in the second
plate will differ from that used in the first. It may
include an antibiotic or exclude a growth factor.
In this way, transformed cells can be selected.

#### Molecular Techniques - Isolation of Genetic Material and Gel Electrophoresis

Electrophoresis is a separating technique used
to separate different biomolecules with positive
and negative charges.

**Principle**

By applying electricity (DC) the molecules
migrate according to the type of charges
they have. The electrical charges on different
molecules are variable. 

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/img8.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}

**Agarose GEL Electrophoresis**

It is used mainly for the purification of specific
DNA fragments. Agarose is convenient for
separating DNA fragments ranging in size
from a few hundred to about 20000 base
pairs. Polyacrylamide is preferred for the
purification of smaller DNA fragments. The gel
is complex network of polymeric molecules.
DNA molecule is negatively charged molecule
- under an electric field DNA molecule
migrates through the gel. The electrophoresis
is frequently performed with marker DNA
fragments of known size which allow accurate
size determination of an unknown DNA
molecule by interpolation. The advantages of
agarose gel electrophoresis are that the DNA
bands can be readily detected at high sensitivity.
The bands of DNA in the gel are stained with
the dye Ethidium Bromide and DNA can be
detected as visible fluorescence illuminated in
UV light will give orange fluorescence, which
can be photographed.

{{< box title="" type="" >}}

Agricultural diagnostics refers to a variety of tests
that are used for detection of pathogens in plant
tissues. Two of the most efficient methods are

**1. ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immumo Sorbent Assay)**

Elisa is a diagnostic tool for identification of
pathogen species by using antibodies and
diagnostic agents. Use of ELISA in plant pathology
especially for weeding out virus infected plants
from large scale planting is well known.

**2. DNA Probes**

DNA Probes, isotopic and non-isotopic (Northern
and Southern blotting) are popular tools for
identification of viruses and other pathogens

{{< /box >}}

#### Nucleic Acid Hybridization - Blotting Techniques

Blotting techniques are widely used analytical
tools for the specific identification of desired
DNA or RNA fragments from larger number
of molecules. Blotting refers to the process of
immobilization of sample nucleic acids or solid
support (nitrocellulose or nylon membranes.)
The blotted nucleic acids are then used as target
in the hybridization experiments for their
specific detection.

###### Types of Blotting Techniques

**Southern Blotting:** The transfer of DNA from
agarose gels to nitrocellulose membrane.

**Northern Blotting:** The transfer of RNA to
nitrocellulose membrane.

**Western Blotting:** Electrophoretic transfer of
Proteins to nitrocellulose membrane.

**Southern Blotting Techniques - DNA**

The transfer of denatured DNA from Agarose
gel to Nitrocellulose Blotting or Filter Paper
technique was introduced by Southern in 1975
and this technique is called Southern Blotting
Technique.

**Steps**

The transfer of DNA from agarose gel to
nitrocellulose filter paper is achieved by
Capillary Action.

A buffer Sodium Saline Citrate (SSC) is
used, in which DNA is highly soluble, it can be
drawn up through the gel into the Nitrocellulose
membrane.

By this process ss-DNA becomes ‘**Trapped**’
in the membrane matrix.
This DNA is hybridized with a nucleic acid
and can be detected by autoradiography.
Autoradiography - A technique that captures
the image formed in a photographic emulsion
due to emission of light or radioactivity from
a labelled component placed together with
unexposed film.

**Northern Blot**

It was found that RNA is not binding to cellulose
nitrate. Therefore, Alwin et al. (1979) devised a
procedure in which RNA bands are transferred
from the agarose gel into nitrocellulose filter
paper. This transfer of RNA from gel to special
filter paper is called Northern Blot hybridization.
The filter paper used for Northern blot is Amino
Benzyloxymethyl Paper which can be prepared
from Whatman 540 paper.

**Western Blot**

Refers to the electrophoretic transfer of proteins
to blotting papers. Nitrocellulose filter paper can
be used for western blot technique. A particular
protein is then identified by probing the blot
with a radio-labelled antibody which binds on
the specific protein to which the antibody was
prepared.

#### Bioassay for Target Gene Effect

Target gene is target DNA, foreign DNA,
passenger DNA, exogenous DNA, gene of
interest or insert DNA that is to be either
cloned or specifically mutated. Gene targeting
experiments have been targeting the nuclei
and this leads to ‘gene knock-out’. For this
purpose, two types of targeting vectors are used.
They are insertion vectors and replacement or
transplacement vectors.

1. Insertion vectors are entirely inserted into
targeted locus as the vectors are linearized
within the homology region. Initially, these 
vectors are circular but during insertion,
become linear. It leads to duplication of
sequences adjacent to selectable markers.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/4.22.png" "w-25 float-end">}}

{{< /figure >}}



{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/table2.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}

2. The replacement vector has the homology
region and it is co-linear with target. This
vector is linearized prior to transfection
outside the homology region and then
consequently a crossing over occurs to
replace the endogenous DNA with the
incoming DNA.

***Transfection: Introduction of foreign nucleic acids into cells by non-viral methods.***

##### 4.7.7. Genome Sequencing and Plant Genome Projects

The whole complement of genes that determine
all characteristics of an organism is called
genome. Which may be nuclear genome,
mitochondrial genome or plastid genome.
Genome of many plants contain both functional
and non-expressive DNA proteins. Genome
project refers to a project in which the whole
genome of plant is analysed using sequence
analysis and sequence homology with other
plants. Such genome projects have so far
been undertaken in Chlamydomonas(algae),
Arabidopsis thaliana, rice and maize plants.

Genome content of an organism is expressed in
terms of number of base pairs or in terms of the
content of DNA which is expressed as c-value.

#### Evolutionary pattern assessed using DNA.

In recent years the evolutionary relationship between different plant taxa is assessed using
DNA content as well as the similarities and
differences in the DNA sequence (sequence
homology). Based on such analysis the taxa and
their relationship are indicated in cladogram.
Which will show the genetic distance between
two taxa. It also shows antiquity or modernity
of any taxon with respect to one another (See
also Unit-2, Chapter-5 of XI Std.)

#### Genome editing and CRISPR - Cas9

Genome editing or gene editing is a group of
technologies that has the ability to change an
organism’s DNA. These technologies allow
genetic material to be added, removed, or altered at particular locations in the genome.
Several approaches to genome editing have
been developed. A recent one is known
as CRISPR-Cas9, which is short form of
**Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats** and CRISPR-associated
protein 9. The CRISPR-Cas9 system has
generated a lot of excitement in the scientific
community because it is faster, cheaper,
more accurate, and more efficient than other
existing genome editing methods.

Rice, was among the first plants to be used
to demonstrate the feasibility of CRISPRmediated targeted mutagenesis  and gene
replacement. The gene editing tool CRISPR
can be used to make hybrid rice plants that
can clone their seed. Imtiyaz Khand and
Venkatesan Sundaresan and
colleagues reported in a new
study which clearly shows
one can re-engineer rice to
switch it from a sexual to an
asexual mode.

#### RNA Interference (RNAi)

All characters of organism are the result
of expression of different genes which are
regions of nuclear DNA. This expression
involves transcription and translation.
Transcription refers to the copying of
genetic information from one strand of the
DNA (called sense strand) by RNA. This
RNA, as soon as it formed cannot be straight
away sent to the cytoplasm to undertake the
process of translation. It has to be edited and
made suitable for translation which brings
about protein synthesis. One of the main
items removed from the RNA strand are the
introns. All these changes before translation
normally take place whereby certain regions
of DNA are silence. However, there is an
(RNAi) pathway. RNA interference is a
biological process in which RNA molecules
inhibit gene expression or translation.
This is done by neutralising targetd mRNA
molecules. 

A simplified model for the RNAi pathway
is based on two steps, each involving
ribonuclease enzyme. In the first step, the
trigger RNA (either dsRNA or miRNA primary
transcript) is processed into a short interfering
RNA (siRNA) by the RNase II enzymes
called Dicer and Drosha. In the second step,
siRNAs are loaded into the effector complex
RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The
siRNA is unwound during RISC assembly
and the single-stranded RNA hybridizes with
mRNA target. This RNAi is seen in plant
feeding nematodes.

### Transgenic Plants / Genetically Modified Crops (Gm Crops)

#### Herbicide Tolerant – Glyphosate

Weeds are a constant problem in crop fields.
Weeds not only compete with crops for
sunlight, water, nutrients and space but also
acts as a carrier for insects and diseases. If left
uncontrolled, weeds can reduce crop yields
significantly.

***Transgenic plants contain a novel DNA introduced into the genome.***

**Glyphosate herbicide** produced by Monsanto,
USA company under the trade name ‘Round
up’ kills plants by blocking the 5-enopyruvate
shikimate-3 phosphate synthase (EPSPS)
enzyme, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis
of aromatic amino acids, vitamins and many
secondary plant metabolites. There are several
ways by which crops can be modified to be
glyphosate-tolerant.

One strategy is to incorporate a soil bacterium
gene that produces a glyphosate tolerant form
of EPSPS. Another way is to incorporate a
different soil bacterium gene that produces a
glyphosate degrading enzyme.

**Advantages of Herbicide Tolerant Crops**


- Weed control improves higher crop yields;

- Reduces spray of herbicide;

- Reduces competition between crop plant and weed;

- Use of low toxicity compounds which do not remain active in the soil; and

- The ability to conserve soil structure and microbes.

#### Herbicide Tolerant - Basta

Trade name ‘Basta’ refers to a non-selective
herbicide containing the chemical compound
phosphinothricin. Basta herbicide tolerant
gene PPT (L-phosphinothricin) was isolated
from Medicago sativa plant. It inhibits the
enzyme glutamine synthase which is involved
in ammonia assimilation. The PPT gene
was introduced into tobacco and transgenic
tobacco produced was resistant to PPT. Similar
enzyme was also isolated from Streptomyces
hygroscopicus with bar gene encodes for PAT
(Phosphinothricin acetyl transferase) and was
introduced into crop plants like potato and
sugar-beet and transgenic crops have been
developed.

#### Insect resistance - Bt Crops:

**i. Bt Cotton**

Bt cotton is a genetically modified organism
(GMO) or genetically modified pest resistant
plant cotton variety, which produces an
insecticide activity to bollworm.

Strains of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis
produce over 200 different Bt toxins, each
harmful to different insects. Most Bt toxins
are insecticidal to the larvae of moths and
butterflies, beetles, cotton bollworms and
gatflies but are harmless to other forms of life. 

The genes are encoded for toxic crystals in the
Cry group of endotoxin. When insects attack
and eat the cotton plant the Cry toxins are
dissolved in the insect’s stomach.

The epithelial membranes of the gut block
certain vital nutrients thereby sufficient
regulation of potassium ions are lost in the
insects and results in the death of epithelial cells
in the intestine membrane which leads to the
death of the larvae.

**Advantages**

The advantages of Bt cotton are:


- Yield of cotton is increased due to effective control of bollworms.

- Reduction in insecticide use in the cultivation of Bt cotton

- Potential reduction in the cost of cultivation.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/4.25.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}

**Disadvantages**

Bt cotton has some limitations:

- Cost of Bt cotton seed is high.

- Effectiveness up to 120 days after that efficiency is reduced

- Ineffective against sucking pests like jassids, aphids and whitefly.

- Affects pollinating insects and thus yield. 

**ii. Bt Brinjal**

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/4.26.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}

The Bt brinjal is another
transgenic plant created
by inserting a crystal
protein gene (Cry1Ac)
from the soil bacterium
Bacillus thuringiensis
into the genome of
various brinjal cultivars. The insertion of the
gene, along with other genetic elements such
as promoters, terminators and an antibiotic
resistance marker gene into the brinjal plant is
accomplished using Agrobacterium- mediated genetic transformation. The Bt brinjal has
been developed to give resistance against
Lepidopberan insects, in particular the Brinjal
Fruit and Shoot Borer (Leucinodes orbonalis).

**iii. Dhara Mustard Hybrid (DMH)**

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/4.27.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}

DMH -11 is transgenic
mustard developed by
a team of scientists at
the Centre for Genetic
Manipulation of Crop
Plants Delhi University
under Government
sponsored project. It is genetically modified
variety of Herbicide Tolerant (HT) mustard.
It was created by using “barnase/barstar”
technology for genetic modification by adding
genes from soil bacterium that makes mustard,
a self-pollinating plant. DMH -11 contains
three genes viz. Bar gene, Barnase and Barstar
sourced from soil bacterium. The bar gene had
made plant resistant to herbicide named Basta.

**4.7.4 Virus Resistance**

Many plants are affected by virus attack
resulting in series loss in yield and even death.
Biotechnological intervention is used to
introduce viral resistant genes into the host plant
so that they can resist the attack by virus. This
is by introducing genes that produce resistant
enzymes which can deactivate viral DNA.

**4.7.5 FlavrSavr Tomato**

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/4.28.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
bio-botant image
{{< /figure >}}

Agrobacterium mediated
genetic engineering
technique was followed
to produce Flavr-Savr
tomato, i.e., retaining the
natural colour and flavor
of tomato.

Through genetic engineering, the ripening
process of the tomato is slowed down and thus
prevent it from softening and to increase the
shelf life. The tomato was made more resistant
to rotting by Agrobacterium mediated gene transfer mechanism of introducing an antisense
gene which interferes with the production of
the enzyme polygalacturonase, which help in
delaying the ripening process of tomato during
long storage and transportation. 

#### Golden rice - Biofortification

Golden rice is a variety of Oryza sativa (rice)
produced through genetic engineering of
biosynthesized beta-carotene, a precursor of
Vitamin-A in the edible parts of rice developed
by Ingo Potrykus and his group. The aim is
to produce a fortified food to be grown and
consumed in areas with a shortage of dietary
Vitamin-A. Golden rice differs from its parental
strain by the addition of three beta-carotene
biosynthesis genes namely ‘psy’ (phytoene
synthase) from daffodil plant Narcissus
pseudonarcissus and ‘crt-1’ gene from the
soil bacterium Erwinia auredorora and ‘lyc’
(lycopene cyclase) gene from wild-type rice
endosperm.

The endosperm of normal rice, does not contain
beta-carotene. Golden-rice has been genetically
altered so that the endosperm now accumulates
Beta-carotene. This has been done using
Recombinant DNA technology. Golden rice can
control childhood blindness - Xerophthalmia.

**GM Food - Benefits**


- High yield without pest

- 70% reduction of pesticide usage

- Reduce soil pollution problem

- Conserve microbial population in soil

**Risks - believed to**


- Affect liver, kidney function and cancer

- Hormonal imbalance and physical disorder

- Anaphylactic shock (sudden hypersensitive

-eaction) and allergies.

- Adverse effect in immune system because of bacterial protein.

- Loss of viability of seeds seen in terminator seed technology of GM crops. 

#### Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)

Synthetic polymers are non-degradable and
pollute the soil and when burnt add dioxin in
the environment which cause cancer. So, efforts
were taken to provide an alternative eco-friendly
biopolymers. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs)
and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) are group of
degradable biopolymers which have several
medical applications such as drug delivery,
scaffold and heart valves. PHAs are biological
macromolecules and thermoplastics which are
biodegradable and biocompatible.

Several microorganisms have been utilized
to produce different types of PHAs including
Gram-positive like Bacillus megaterium,
Bacillussubtilis and Corynebacterium
glutamicum, Gram-negative bacteria like group
of Pseudomonas sp. and Alcaligenes eutrophus.

#### Polylactic acid (PLA)

Polylactic acid or
polylactide (PLA)
is a biodegradable
and bioactive
thermoplastic. It is
an aliphatic polyester
derived from
renewable resources,
such as corn starch,
cassava root, chips or starch or sugarcane. For
the production of PLA, two main monomers
are used: lactic acid, and the cyclic diester,
lactide. The most common route is the ringopening polymerization of lactide with metal catalysts like tin octoate in solution. The metalcatalyzed reaction results in equal amount of d
and polylactic acid.

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/4.30.png" "w-25 float-end">}}

#### Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)

The green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a protein
containing 238 amino acid residues of 26.9 kDa
that exhibits bright green fluorescence when
exposed to blue to ultraviolet range (395 nm).
GFP refers to the protein first isolated from the
jellyfish Aequorea victoria. GFP is an excellent
tool in biology due to its ability to form internal
chromophore without requiring any accessory
cofactors, gene products, enzymes or substrates
other than molecular oxygen. In cell and
molecular biology, the GFP gene is frequently
used as a reporter of expression. It has been
used in modified forms to make biosensors.

#### Biopharming

Biopharming also known as molecular
pharming is the production and use of
transgenic plants genetically engineered to
produce pharmaceutical substances for use of
human beings. This is also called “**molecular farming or pharming**”. These plants are
different from medicinal plants which are
naturally available. The use of plant systems
as bioreactors is gaining more significance in
modern biotechnology. Many pharmaceutical
substances can be produced using transgenic
plants. Example: Golden rice

#### Bioremediation

It is defined as the use of microorganisms or
plants to manage environmental pollution. It
is an approach used to treat wastes including
wastewater, industrial waste and solid waste.
Bioremediation process is applied to the
removal of oil, petrochemical residues,
pesticides or heavy metals from soil or ground
water. In many cases, bioremediation is less
expensive and more sustainable than other
physical and chemical methods of remediation.
An eco-friendly approach and can deal with lower concentrations of contaminants more
effectively. The strategies for bioremediation in
soil and water can be as follows:

- Use of indigenous microbial population
as indicator species for bioremediation
process.

- Bioremediation with the addition of adapted
or designed microbial inoculants.

- Use of plants for bioremediation - green
technology.

Some examples of bioremediation
technologies are:

- **Phytoremediation** - use of plants to bring
about remediation of environmental
pollutants.

- **Mycoremediation** - use of fungi to bring
about remediation of environmental
pollutants.

- **Bioventing** a process that increases
the oxygen or air flow to accelerate the
degradation of environmental pollutants.

- **Bioleaching** use of microorganisms in
solution to recover metal pollutants from
contaminated sites.

- **Bioaugmentation** a addition of selected
microbes to speed up degradation process.

- **Composting** process by which the solid
waste is composted by the use of microbes
into manure which acts as a nutrient for
plant growth.

- **Rhizofiltration** uptake of metals or
degradation of organic compounds by
rhizosphere microorganisms.

- **Rhizostimulation** stimulation of plant
growth by the rhizosphere by providing
better growth condition or reduction in
toxic materials.

**Limitations**

- Only biodegradable contaminants can
be transformed using bioremediation
processes.

- Bioremediation processes must be
specifically made in accordance to the
conditions at the contaminated site.

- Small-scale tests on a pilot scale must be
performed before carrying out the procedure
at the contaminated site.

- The use of genetic engineering technology to
create genetically modified microorganism
or a consortium of microbes for
bioremediation process has great potential.

#### Biofuel: Algal Biofuel

Algal fuel, also known as algal biofuel, or
algal oil is an alternative to liquid fossil fuels,
the petroleum products. This is also used as a
source of energy-rich oils. Also, algal fuels are
an alternative to commonly known biofuel
sources obtained from corn and sugarcane.
The energy crisis and the world food crisis have
initiated interest in algal culture (farming algae)
for making biodiesel and other biofuels on lands
unsuitable for agriculture. Botryococcus braunii
is normally used to produce algal biofuel.

**Biological hydrogen production by algae**

The biological hydrogen production with
algae is a method of photo biological water
splitting. In normal photosynthesis the alga,
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii releases oxygen.
When it is deprived of sulfur, it switches to the
production of hydrogen during photosynthesis
and the electrons are transported to ferredoxins. 

[Fe]-hydrogenase enzymes combine them into
the production of hydrogen gas.

4.8.13 Bioprospecting
Bioprospecting is the process of discovery and
commercialization of new products obtained
from biological resources. Bioprospecting
may involve biopiracy, in which indigenous
knowledge of nature, originating with
indigenous people, is used by others for profit,
without authorization or compensation to the indigenous people themselves.

###### Biopiracy

Biopiracy can be defined as the manipulation of
intellectual property rights laws by corporations
to gain exclusive control over national genetic
resources, without giving adequate recognition
or remuneration to the original possessors of
those resources. Examples of biopiracy include
recent patents granted by the U.S. Patent and
Trademarks Office to American companies on
turmeric, ‘neem’ and, most notably, ‘basmati’
rice. All three products are indigenous to the
Indo-Pak subcontinent.

**Biopiracy of Neem**

The people of India used neem and its oil in many
ways to controlling fungal and bacterial skin
infections. Indian’s have shared the knowledge
of the properties of the neem with the entire
world. Pirating this knowledge, the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) and an
American MNC (Multi Nation Corporation)
W.R.Grace in the early 90’s sought a patent from the European Patent Office (EPO) on the “method
for controlling of diseases on plants by the aid of
extracted hydrophobic neem oil”. The patenting
of the fungicidal and antibacterial properties
of Neem was an example of biopiracy but the
traditional knowledge of the Indians was protected
in the end.

**Biopiracy of Turmeric**

The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in
the year 1995 granted patent to the method of use
of turmeric as an antiseptic agent. Turmeric has
been used by the Indians as a home remedy for the
quick healing of the wounds and also for purpose
of healing rashes. The journal article published by
the Indian Medical Association, in the year 1953
wherein this remedy was mentioned. Therefore, in
this way it was proved that the use of turmeric as
an antiseptic is not new to the world and is not a
new invention, but formed a part of the traditional
knowledge of the Indians. The objection in this
case US patent and trademark office was upheld
and traditional knowledge of the Indians was
protected. It is another example of Biopiracy.

**Biopiracy of Basmati**

On September 2, 1997, the U.S. Patent and
Trademarks Office granted Patent on “basmati
rice lines and grains” to the Texas-based company
RiceTec. This broad patent gives the company
several rights, including exclusive use of the term
'basmati', as well proprietary rights on the seeds and
grains from any crosses. The patent also covers the
process of breeding RiceTec’s novel rice lines and
the method to determine the cooking properties
and starch content of the rice grains.

India had periled the United States to take the
matter to the WTO as an infringement of the
TRIPS agreement, which could have resulted
in major embarrassment for the US. Hence
voluntarily and due to few decisions take by the
US patent office, Rice Tec had no choice but to
lose most of the claims and most importantly
the right to call the rice “Basmati”. In the year
2002, the final decision was taken. Rice Tec
dropped down 15 claims, resulting in clearing the path of Indian Basmati rice exports to the
foreign countries. The Patent Office ordered the
patent name to be changed to ‘Rice lines 867’.

#### Summary

Biotechnology is the science of applied biological
process in which there is a controlled use of
biological agents such as microorganisms
or cellular components for beneficial use. A
Hungarian Engineer, Karl Ereky (1919) coined
the term biotechnology. Biotechnology broadly
categorized into traditional practices and modern
practices. Traditional biotechnology includes our
ancient practices such as fermentation. Single
Cell Protein (SCP) organisms are grown in large
quantities to produce goods rich in protein,
minerals, fats, carbohydrates and vitamins. The
modern biotechnology embraces all the genetic
manipulations. The recombinant DNA technology
is a technique of modern biotechnology in which
transfer of DNA coding for a specific gene
from one organism is introduced into another
organism using specific agents like vectors or
using instruments like electroporation, gene
gun, liposome mediated, chemical mediated and
micro injection. Other tools are enzymes and host
organisms. The enzyme restriction endonuclease
is a molecular scissor that cleaves DNA into
fragments at or near specific recognition sites with
the molecule known as restriction sites. Other
enzymes are DNA ligase and alkaline phosphatase.
DNA ligase enzyme joins the sugar and phosphate
molecules of double stranded DNA. Alkaline
phosphatase is an enzyme which adds or removes
specific phosphate group of double stranded DNA.
A vector is a small DNA molecule capable of
self replication and used as a carrier of DNA
inserted in the host cell. Few examples of vectors
are plasmid – pBR 322, cosmid – Lambda phage,
M13, Phagmid , BAC, YAC, transposon, shuttle
vector and expression vector.

After production of recombinant DNA molecule
has been generated is introduced into a suitable
host cell. Type of host cell depends upon the
cloning experiment. E.coli is the most widely
used host organism. There are two kinds of gene
transfer methods in plants. They are direct or
vectorless gene transfer and indirect or vector mediated gene transfer. Direct gene transfer
includes chemical mediated gene transfer, micro
injection, electroporation. Gene gun method and
Liposome mediated method of gene transfer.
Indirect or vector mediated gene transfer is
a method of gene transfer with the help of a
plasmid vector. In this method Ti-plasmid
from Agrobactirum tumefeciens has been used
extensively for vector mediated gene transfer.

After the introduction of rDNA into a host
cell, it is essential to identify those cells which
have received the rDNA molecule. This process
is called screening. One of the method of
recombinant screening is blue white selection
method Replica plating technique in which the

pattern of colonies growing on a culture plate is
copied. Electrophoresis is a separating technique
used to separate different biomolecules.

Blotting techniques are widely used tools for
identification of desired DNA or RNA fragments
from larger number of molecules. Some of the
genetically modified crops are herbicide tolerant – Basta, Dhara mustard, insects resistance – Bt crops, flavrSavr – Tomato, Golden rice.
Biopolymers are polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB),
polylactic acid (PLA) and green fluorescent
protein (GFP) is used to make biosensors. Other
applications are biopharming, bioprospecting,
biomedication and biofuel, etc.
