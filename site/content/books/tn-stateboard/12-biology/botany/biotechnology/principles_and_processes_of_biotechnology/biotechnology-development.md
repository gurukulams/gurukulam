Biotechnology has developed by leaps and bounds during the past century and its development can be well understood under two main heads namely **conventional or traditional biotechnology and modern biotechnology** 

**1. Conventional or traditional biotechnology:** 

This is the kitchen technology developed by our ancestors, and it is as old as human civilization. It uses bacteria and other microbes in the daily usage for preparation of dairy products like curd, ghee, cheese and in preparation of foods like idli, dosa, nan, bread and pizza. This conventional biotechnology also extends to preparation of alcoholic beverages like beer, wine, etc. With the advancement of the science and technology during the 18th century, these kitchen technologies gained scientific validation.

**2. Modern biotechnology**

There are two main features of this technology,
that differentiated it from the conventional
technology they are i) ability to change the
genetic material for getting new products with
specific requirement through recombinant
DNA technology ii) ownership of the newly
developed technology and its social impact.
Today, biotechnology is a billion dollar business
around the world, where in pharmaceutical
companies, breweries, agro industries and
other biotechnology based industries apply
biotechnological tools for their product
improvement.

Modern biotechnology embraces all methods
of genetic modification by recombinant DNA
and cell fusion technology. The major focus of
biotechnology are

- **Fermentation** for production of acids,
enzymes, alcohols, antibiotics, fine
chemicals, vitamins and toxins

- **Biomass for** bulk production of single cell
protein , alcohol, and biofuel

- **Enzymes** as biosensors, in processing
industry

- **Biofuels** for production of hydrogen,
alcohol, methane

- **Microbial inoculants** as biofertiliser, and
nitrogen fixers

- **Plant and animal cell culture** for production
of secondary metabolites, monoclonal
antibodies

- **Recombinant DNA technology** for production of fine chemicals, enzymes,
vaccines, growth hormones, antibiotics, and
interferon

- **Process engineering** â€“ tools of
biotechnology is used for effluent treatment,
water recycling.
This unit will reveal the various aspects of
modern biotechnology, its products and
applications.
