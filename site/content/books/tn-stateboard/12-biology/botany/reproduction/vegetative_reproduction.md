#### Natural methods

Natural vegetative reproduction is a form of
asexual reproduction in which a bud grows
and develops into a new plant. The buds may
be formed in organs such as root, stem and
leaf. At some stage, the new plant gets detached
from the parent plant and starts to develop
into a new plant. Some of the organs involved
in the vegetative reproduction also serve as the
organs of storage and perennation. The unit of
reproductive structure used in propagation is
called **reproductive propagules** or **diaspores**.
Some of the organs that help in vegetative
reproduction are given in Figure 1.1

### A. Vegetative reproduction in root


The roots of some plants develop vegetative or
adventitious buds on them. Example *Murraya*,
*Dalbergia* and *Millingtonia*. Some tuberous
adventitious roots apart from developing buds
also store food. Example *Ipomoea* batatus
and *Dahlia*. Roots possessing buds become
detached from the parent plant and grow into
independent plant under suitable condition.

Visit to a vegetable market and classify the
vegetables into root, stem or leaf based on
their utility and identify how many of them
can be propagated through asexual methods.

### B. Vegetative reproduction in stem


From the Unit 3 of class XI (Vegetative
morphology) you are familiar with the structure
of various underground stem and sub aerial stem
modifications. These include rhizome (*Musa*
*paradisiaca*, *Zingiber officinale* and *Curcuma*
*longa*); corm (*Amorphophallus* and *Colocasia*);
tuber (*Solanum tuberosum*); bulb(*Allium* *cepa*
and *Lilium*) runner (*Centella asiatica*); stolon
(*Mentha*, and *Fragaria*); offset (*Pistia*, and
*Eichhornia*); sucker (*Chrysanthemum*) and
bulbils (*Dioscorea and Agave*). The axillary buds
from the nodes of rhizome and eyes of tuber give
rise to new plants.


### C. Vegetative reproduction in leaf


In some plants adventitious buds are developed
on their leaves. When they are detached
from the parent plant they grow into new
individual plants. Examples: *Bryophyllum*,
*Scilla*, and *Begonia*. In *Bryophyllum*, the
leaf is succulent and notched on its margin.
Adventious buds develop at these notches and
are called **epiphyllous buds**. They develop
into new plants forming a root system and
become independent plants when the leaf gets
decayed. *Scilla* is a bulbous plant and grows
in sandy soils. The foliage leaves are long and
narrow and epiphyllous buds develop at their
tips. These buds develop into new plants when
they touch the soil.

**Advantages of natural vegetative**
**reproduction**

• Only one parent is required for propagation.

• The new individual plants produced are
genetically identical.

• In some plants, this enables to spread
rapidly. Example: Spinifex

• Horticulturists and farmers utilize these
organs of natural vegetative reproduction
for cultivation and to harvest plants in
large scale.

**Disadvantage of natural vegetative**
**reproduction**

• New plants produced have no genetic
variation.


#### Artificial Methods

Apart from the above mentioned natural methods
of vegetative reproduction, a number of methods
are used in agriculture and horticulture to
propagate plants from their parts. Such methods
are said to be artificial propagation. Some of the
artificial propagation methods have been used by
man for a long time and are called **conventional**
**methods**. Now-a-days, technology is being used
for propagation to produce large number of plants
in a short period of time. Such methods are said
to be **modern methods**.


#### A. Conventional methods

The common methods of conventional
propagation are cutting, grafting and layering.



**a. Cutting**:

 It is the method of producing a new
plant by cutting the plant parts such as root, stem
and leaf from the parent plant. The cut part is placed
in a suitable medium for growth. It produces root
and grows into a new plant. Depending upon the
part used it is called as root cutting (*Malus*), stem
cutting (*Hibiscus*, *Bougainvillea* and *Moringa*) and
leaf cutting (*Begonia*, *Bryophyllum*). Stem cutting
is widely used for propagation.



**b.Grafting**: 

In this, parts of two different plants
are joined so that they continue to grow as one
plant. Of the two plants, the plant which is in
contact with the soil is called **stock** and the
plant used for grafting is called **scion** (Figure
1.2 a). Examples are Citrus, Mango and Apple.
There are different types of grafting based on the
method of uniting the scion and stock. They are
bud grafting, approach grafting, tongue grafting,
crown grafting and wedge grafting.


**i. Bud grafting**: 

A T- shaped incision is made
in the stock and the bark is lifted. The scion bud
with little wood is placed in the incision beneath
the bark and properly bandaged with a tape.



**ii. Approach grafting**: 

In this method both
the scion and stock remain rooted. The stock
is grown in a pot and it is brought close to
the scion. Both of them should have the same
thickness. A small slice is cut from both and the
cut surfaces are brought near and tied together
and held by a tape. After 1-4 weeks the tip of
the stock and base of the scion are cut off and
detached and grown in a separate pot. 

**iii. Tongue grafting**


A scion and stock having the same thickness is
cut obliquely and the scion is fit into the stock
and bound with a tape.


**iv. Crown grafting.**


When the stock is large in size scions are cut
into wedge shape and are inserted on the slits
or clefts of the stock and fixed in position
using graft wax.


**v. Wedge grafting**


In this method a slit is made in the stock or the
bark is cut. A twig of scion is inserted and tightly
bound so that the cambium of the two is joined.

Visit a nursery, observe the method of
grafting, layering and do these techniques
with plants growing in your school or home

**c. Layering:**


 In this method, the stem of
a parent plant is allowed to develop roots
while still intact. When the root develops,


{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/images/1.3.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
lesson 1
{{< /figure >}}

the rooted part is cut and planted to grow as
a new plant. Examples: *Ixora* and *Jasminum*.
Mound layering and Air layering are few types
of layering (Figure 1.2 b). 

**i**. **Mound** **layering**:

 This method is applied for
the plants having flexible branches. The lower
branch with leaves is bent to the ground and
part of the stem is buried in the soil and tip of
the branch is exposed above the soil. After the
roots emerge from the part of the stem buried
in the soil, a cut is made in parent plant so that
the buried part grow into a new plant.

**ii**. **Air** **layering**: 

In this method the stem is
girdled at nodal region and hormones are
applied to this region which promotes rooting.
This portion is covered with damp or moist soil
using a polythene sheet. Roots emerge in these branches after 2-4 months. Such branches are
removed from the parent plant and grown in a
separate pot or ground.

**Advantages of conventional methods**


• The plants produced are genetically uniform.


• Many plants can be produced quickly by
this method.


• Some plants produce little or no seeds;
in others, the seeds produced do not
germinate. In such cases, plants can be
produced in a short period by this method.


• Some plants can be propagated more
economically by vegetative propagation.
Example: *Solanum tuberosum*.


• Two different plants with desirable
characters such as disease resistance and
high yield can be grafted and grown as a new
plant with the same desirable characters.

**Disadvantages of conventional methods**


• Use of virus infected plants as parents
produces viral infected new plants.


• Vegetative structures used for propagation
are bulky and so they are difficult to handle
and store.
