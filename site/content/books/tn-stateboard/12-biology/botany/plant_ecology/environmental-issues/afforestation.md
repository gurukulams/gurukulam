### Afforestation

Afforestation is planting of trees where there was
no previous tree coverage and the conversion
of non-forested lands into forests by planting
suitable trees to retrieve the vegetation. Example:
Slopes of dams afforested to reduce water run-
off, erosion and siltation. It can also provide
a range of environmental services including
carbon sequestration, water retention.

**Afforestation Objectives**


* To increase forest cover, planting more trees,
increases\\( (O_2) \\)
production and air quality.



* Rehabilitation of degraded forests to
increase carbon fixation and reducing \\( (CO_2) \\)
from atmosphere.


* Raising bamboo plantations.


* Mixed plantations of minor forest produce
and medicinal plants.


* Regeneration of indigenous herbs / shrubs.



* Awareness creation, monitoring and
evaluation.



* To increase the level and availability of water
table or ground water and also to reduce
nitrogen leaching in soil and nitrogen
contamination of drinking water, thus
making it pure not polluted with nitrogen.



* Nature aided artificial regeneration.


**Achievements**



* Degraded forests were restored



* Community assets like overhead tanks
bore-wells, hand pumps, community halls,
libraries, etc were 


* Environmental and ecological stability was
maintained.


* Conserved bio-diversity, wildlife and genetic
resources.


* Involvement of community especially
women in forest management.
