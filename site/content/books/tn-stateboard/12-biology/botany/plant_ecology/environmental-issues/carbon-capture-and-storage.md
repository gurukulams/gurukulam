Carbon capture and storage is a technology of
capturing carbondioxide and injects it deep into
the underground rocks to a depth of 1 km or more
and it is an approach to mitigate global warming
by capturing \\( (CO_2) \\) from large point sources such
as industries and power plants and subsequently
storing it instead of releasing it into the
atmosphere. Various safe sites have been selected
for permanent storage in various deep geological
formations, liquid storage in the Ocean and solid
storage by reduction of \\( (CO_2) \\) with metal oxide to
produce stable carbonates. It is also known as
Geological sequestration which involves injecting
\\( (CO_2) \\) directly into the underground geological
formations (such as declining oil fields, gas fields
saline aquifers and unmineable coal have been
suggested as storage sites).



##### Carbon Sequestration


Carbon sequestration is the process of capturing
and storing \\( (CO_2) \\) which reduces the amount of
\\( (CO_2) \\) in the atmosphere with a goal of reducing
global climate change.



Carbon sequestration occurs naturally by plants
and in ocean. Terrestrial sequestration is typically
accomplished through forest and soil conservation
practices that enhance the storage carbon.



As an example microalgae such as species
of *Chlorella, Scenedesmus, Chroococcus* and
*Chlamydomonas* are used globally for \\( (CO_2) \\)
sequestration. Trees like *Eugenia caryophyllata*,
*Tecoma stans*, *Cinnamomum verum* have
high capacity and noted to sequester carbon.
Macroalgae and marine grasses and mangroves
are also have ability to mitigate carbon-di-oxide.



##### Carbon Foot Print (CFP)



Every human activity leaves a mark just like
our footprint. This **Carbon foot print** is the
total amount of green house gases produced by
human activities such as agriculture, industries,
deforestation, waste disposal, buring fossil
fuels directly or indirectly. It can be measured
for an individual, family, organisation like
industries, state level or national level. It is
usually estimated and expressed in equivalent
tons of \\( (CO_2) \\) per year. The burning of fossil
fuels releases \\( (CO_2) \\) and other green house gases.
In turn these emissions trap solar energy and
thus increase the global temperature resulting
in ice melting, submerging of low lying areas
and inbalance in nature like cyclones, tsunamis
and extreme weather conditions. To reduce
the carbon foot print we can
follow some practices like
(i) Eating indigenous fruits
and products (ii) Reducing
use of electronic devices (iii)
Reduce travelling (iv) Avoid
buying fast and preserved,
processed, packed foods. (v)
Plant a garden (vi) Reducing consumption of meat and
sea food. Poultry requires
little space, nutrients and less
pollution compared cattle

farming. (vii) reducing use of Laptops (when
used for 8 hours, it releases nearly 2 kg. of \\( (CO_2) \\)
annually) (viii) Line drying clothes. (Example:
If you buy imported fruit like kiwi, indirectly
it increases CFP. How? The fruit has travelled
a long distance in shipping or airliner thus
emitting tons of \\( (CO_2) \\)



##### Biochar



**Biochar** is another long term method to store
carbon. To increase plants ability to store more
carbon, plants are partly burnt such as crop
waste, waste woods to become carbon rich
slow decomposing substances of material called
Biochar. It is a kind of charcoal used as a soil
amendment. Biochar is a stable solid, rich in
carbon and can endure in soil for thousands of
years. Like most charcoal, biochar is made from
biomass via pyrolysis. (Heating biomas in low
oxygen environment) which arrests wood from
complete burning. Biochar thus has the potential
to help mitigate climate change via carbon

sequestration. Independently, biochar when
added to soil can increase soil fertility of acidic
soils, increase agricultural productivity, and
provide protection against some foliar and soil
borne diseases. It is a good method of preventing
waste woods and logs from getting decayed and
instead we can convert them into biochar thus
converting them to carbon storage material.
