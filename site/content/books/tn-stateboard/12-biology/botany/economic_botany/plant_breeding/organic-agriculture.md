Organic farming is an alternative agricultural
system which originated early in the twentieth
century in reaction to rapidly changing farming
practices. It is a production system that sustains
the health of the soils, ecosystems and people. It
relies on ecological processes, biodiversity and
cycles adapted to local conditions rather than
the use of inputs with adverse effects.

#### . Biofertilizers 

Biofertilizers are defined as preparations
containing living cells or latent cells of
efficient strains of microorganisms that
help crop plants uptake of nutrients by
their interactions in the rhizosphere when
applied through seed or soil. Biofertilizers
could be also called as microbial cultures,
bioinoculants, bacterial inoculants or
bacterial fertilizers.


They are efficient in fixing nitrogen,
solubilising phosphate and decomposing
cellulose. They are designed to improve
the soil fertility, plant growth, and also the
number and biological activity of beneficial
microorganisms in the soil. They are eco-
friendly organic agro inputs and are more
efficient and cost effective than chemical
fertilizers.

**Rhizobium**

Bio-fertilisers containing rhizobium bacteria
are called *rhizobium* bio-fertilizer culture.
Symbiotic bacteria that reside inside the root
nodules convert the atmospheric nitrogen
into a bio available form to the plants. This
nitrogen fixing bacterium when applied to the
soil undergoes multiplication and fixes the
atmospheric nitrogen in the soil. *Rhizobium* is
best suited for the paddy fields which increase
the yield by 15 – 40%

**Azolla**

*Azolla* is a free-floating water fern that fixes
the atmospheric nitrogen in association with
nitrogen fixing blue green alga Anabaena azolla.
It is used as a bio-fertilizer for wetland rice
cultivation and is known to contribute 40 – 60
kg/ha/crop. The agronomic potential of Azolla
is quite significant particularly for increasing the
yield of rice crop, as it quickly decompose in soil.

**Arbuscular mycorrhizae**

Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) is formed by
the symbiotic association between certain
phycomycetous fungi and angiosperm roots.
They have the ability to dissolve the phosphates
found in abundance in the soil.

Apart from increasing the availability of
phosphorus, AM provides necessary strength to
resist disease, germs and unfavourable weather
conditions. It also assures water availability.

**Seaweed Liquid Fertilizer**

Seaweed liquid fertilizer (SLF) contains
cytokinin, gibberellins and auxin apart from
macro and micro nutrients. Most seaweed based
fertilizers are made from kelp(brown algae)
which grows to length of 150 metres. seaweed
Liquid fertilizer is
not only organic
but also eco-
friendly.

in the soil and
form long, cross-linked polymers in the soil.
These polymers improve the crumbing in the
soil, swell up when they get wet and retain
moisture for a long time. They are especially
useful in organic gardening which provides
carbohydrates for plants. Seaweed has more
than 70 minerals, vitamins and enzymes. It
promotes vigorous growth. Improves resistance
of plants to frost and disease. Seeds soaked in
seaweed extract germinate much rapidly and
develop a better root system.

**Bio-Pesticides**

Bio-pesticides are biological agents used for the
control of plant pests. They are in high use due
to their non-toxic, cheaper and eco-friendly
characteristics as compared to chemical or
synthetic pesticides. Bio-pesticides have become
an integral component of pest management in
terms of the environmental and health issues
attributed to the use of chemicals in agriculture.


**Trichoderma** species are free-living fungi
that are common in soil and root ecosystem.
They have been recognized as bio-control agent
for (1) the control of plant disease (2) ability
to enhance root growth development (3) crop
productivity (4) resistance to abiotic stress and
(5) uptake and use of nutrients.

Beauveria species is an entomo-pathogenic
fungus that grows naturally in soils throughout
the world. It acts as a parasite on various
arthropod species causing white muscardine
disease without affecting the plant health and
growth. It also controls damping off of tomato
caused by **Rhizoctonia solani.**


**Green Manuring**

Green manuring is defined as the growing
of green manure crops and use of these crops
directly in the field by ploughing. One of the
main objectives of the green manuring is to
increase the content of nitrogen in the soil. Also
it helps in improving the structure and physical
properties of the soil. The most important green
manure crops are Crotalaria juncea, Tephrosia
purpurea, Indigofera tinctoria

The green manuring can be practised
as Green in-situ manuring or Green leaf
manuring. Green in-situ manuring refers to
the growing of green manuring crops in the
border rows or as intercrops along with the
main crops. Example: Sun hemp, Cowpea,
Green gram etc. whereas green leaf manuring
is the application of green leaves and twigs of
trees, shrubs, plants growing in wastelands
and field bunds. The important plant species
useful for green leaf manure are Cassia fistula,
Sesbania **grandiflora, Azadirachta indica,**
**Delonix regia, Pongamia** pinnata etc.
