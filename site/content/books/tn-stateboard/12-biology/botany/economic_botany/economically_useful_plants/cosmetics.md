Traditionally in Southern India, people have
been using turmeric, green gram powder,
henna, sigaikai and usilai for their skin and
hair care. These were mostly home prepared
products that are used for grooming. Today,
cosmetics have a high commercial value
and have become chemical based industrial
products. Providing personal care services
has become a major industry. In recent years,
people have realized the hazards of chemical-
based cosmetics and are turning back to
natural products. In this chapter one of the
major plants namely Aloe which is used in the
cosmetic industries is discussed.

#### Perfumes

The word perfume is derived from the Latin
word Per (through) and fumus (to smoke),
meaning through smoke. It refers to the
age-old tradition of burning scented woods
at religious ceremonies.In early days, when
people were less conscious of personal
hygiene, essential oils not only masked
offensive odours, but also may have acted as
antiseptics. Perfumes are added to baths and
used for anointing the body.

Perfumes are manufacturefrom essential
oil which are volatile and aromatic. Essential
oils are found at different parts of the plant
such as leaves, (curry leaf, mint), flowers (rose,
jasmine), fruits (citrus, straw berry) and wood
(sandal, eucalyptus).
