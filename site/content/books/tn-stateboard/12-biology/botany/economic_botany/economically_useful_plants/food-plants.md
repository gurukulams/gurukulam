Currently about 10,000 food plants are being
used of which only around 1,500 species were
brought under cultivation. However, food
base of majority of the population depends
only on three grass species namely rice, wheat
and maize.

#### Cereals 

The word cereal is derived from Ceres, which
according to the Roman mythology denotes
“Goddess of agriculture”. All cereals are members
of grass family (Poaceae) that are grown for their
edible starchy seeds. The prominence of cereals
as food plants is due to the following attributes:

i. Greater adaptability and successful
colonisation on every type of habitat.


ii. The relative ease of cultivation


iii. Tillering property that produce more
branches which results in higher yield per
unit area.


iv. Compact and dry grains that they can be
easily handled, transported and stored
without undergoing spoilage.


v. High caloric value that provides energy.
The nutrients provided by cereals include
carbohydrates, proteins, fibres and a wide
range of vitamins and minerals. Cereals can
be classified into two different types based
on their size namely Major Cereals and
Minor Cereals.


### Major Cereals

#### <u> Rice / Paddy 

*Botanical name : Oryza sativa*

Paddy is a semi-aquatic crop and is grown in
standing water. It is an important food crop
of the world, occupying the second position
in terms of area under cultivation and
production, next to wheat. Rice is the chief
source of carbohydrate.

**Origin and Area of cultivation**

South East Asia is considered as the center
of origin of rice. Earliest evidences of rice
cultivation have been found in China, India
and Thailand. It is mainly cultivated in Delta
and irrigated regions of Tamil Nadu.

**Uses**

**Rice** is the easily digestible calorie rich
cereal food which is used as a staple food
in Southern and North East India. Various
rice products such as **Flaked rice** (Aval),
**Puffed rice / parched rice** (Pori) are used as
breakfast cereal or as snack food in different
parts of India.

**Rice bran oil** obtained from the rice bran is
used in culinary and industrial purposes.

**Husks**are used as fuel, and in the manufacture
of packing material and fertilizer.

**Origin and Area of cultivation**

Earliest evidence for wheat cultivation
comes from Fertile Crescent region. The
common cultivated wheat, Triticum aestivum
is cultivated for about 7,500 years. Wheat is
mostly cultivated in the North Indian states
such as Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana,
Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar.

**Uses**

Wheat is the staple food in Northern India.
Wheat flour is suitable to make bread and other
bakery products. Processed wheat flour, that
has little fibre, is called Maida which is used
extensively in making parota, naan and bakery
products. Malted wheat is a major raw material
for producing alcoholic beverages and nutritive
drinks.

**PSEUDO-CEREAL**

The term pseudo-cereal is
used to describe foods that
are prepared and eaten
as a whole grain,
but are botanical
outliers
from
grasses. Example:
quinoa.
It
is
actually a seed from
Pseudo cereal -
the Chenopodium
Chenopodium quinoa
quinoa
plant
belongs to the family Amaranthaceae. It is
a gluten-free, whole-grain carbohydrate, as
well as a whole protein (meaning it contains
all nine essential amino acids) and have been
eaten for 6,000 years in Andes hill region.

#### Pulses 

The word Pulse is derived from the Latin
words ‘puls’ or ‘pultis’ meaning “thick soup”.
Pulses are the edible seeds that are harvested
from the fruits of Fabaceae. They provide vital
source of plant-based protein, vitamins and
minerals for people around the globe.

**Black gram**

*Botanical name : Vigna mungo*

#### Vegetables 

While walking through a market filled with fresh
vegetables like stacks of lady’s finger, mountains
of potatoes, pyramids of brinjal, tomatoes,
cucurbits, we learn to choose the vegetables that
is fresh, tender, ripe and those suit the family
taste through experience and cultural practices.
Why do we need to eat vegetables and what do
they provide us?

Vegetables are the important part of
healthy eating and provide many nutrients,
including potassium, fiber, folic acid and
vitamins A, E and C. The nutrients in vegetables
are vital for maintenance of our health.

**Lady’s finger / Okra**

*Botanical name : Abelmoschus esculentus*
Family: Malvaceae

**Origin and Area of cultivation**

Lady’s finger is a native of the Tropical Africa.
Assam, Maharashtra and Gujarat are the
important states where Lady’s finger is grown in
abundance. Coimbatore, Dharmapuri and Vellore
are the major cultivating regions of Tamil Nadu.

**Uses**

The fresh and green tender fruits are used
as a vegetable. Often they are sliced and
dehydrated to conserve them for later use. It
has most important nutrients.

**10.1.6 Fruits**

Edible fruits are fleshy structures with a pleasant
aroma and flavours. Fruits are sources of many
nutrients including potassium, dietary fiber,
folic acid and vitamins.Depending on the
climatic region in which fruit crops grow, they
can be classified into temperate(apple, pear,
plum) and tropical fruits (mango, jack, banana).
In this chapter we will study an example of
tropical fruit.

**Mango** (National fruit of India)

*Botanical name : Mangifera indica*
*Family: Anacardiaceae*

{{< figure "images/books/12-biology/botany/unit10/pic5.png" "w-25 float-end">}}
Figure 10.5: Mango
{{< /figure >}}

Origin and Area of
cultivation
The mango is the native
to
Southern
Asia,
especially Burma and
Eastern India. It is the
National fruit of India. Figure 10.5: Mango
Major mango producing
States are Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat and
Karnataka. Salem, Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri are
the major mango producing districts of Tamil
Nadu. Some of the major cultivars of mango in
India are Alphonsa, Banganapalli, neelam and
malgova.

**Uses**

Mango is the major table fruit of India, which
is rich in beta carotenes. It is utilized in many
ways, as dessert, canned, dried and preserves
in Indian cuisine. Sour, unripe mangoes are
used in chutneys, pickles, side dishes, or may
be eaten raw with salt and chili. Mango pulp is
made into jelly. Aerated and non-aerated fruit
juice is a popular soft drink.

#### Nuts 
Nuts are simple dry fruits composed of a hard
shell and an edible kernel. They are packed
with a good source of healthy fats, fibre,
protein, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.

**Cashew nut**
*Botanical name : Anacardium occidentale*
*Family: Anacardiaceae*

**Origin and Area of cultivation**

Cashew has originated in Brazil and made its way
to India in the 16th century through Portuguese
sailors. Cashew is grown in Kerala, Karnataka,
Goa, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Orissa.

**Uses**

Cashews
are
commonly
used
for
garnishing
sweets or curries, or Cashew
ground into a paste
that forms a base of
sauces for curries or some sweets. Roasted and
raw kernels are used as snacks.


#### Sugars

We experienced sweetness while eating the
stems of sugarcane, roots of sugar beet, fruits
of apple and while drinking palmyra sap. This
is due to the different proportions of sugars
found in it. Sugar is the generic name for
sweet tasting soluble carbohydrate, which are
used in foods and beverages. Sugars found in
sugarcane and palmyra make them ideal for
efficient extraction to make commercial sugar.

**Sugarcane**

*Botanical name : Saccharum officinarum*
*Family : Poaceae*

**Origin and Area of cultivation**

The cultivated Saccharum officinarum
has evolved by repeated back crossing of
S.officinarum of New Guinea with wild
S.spontaneum of India to improve the quality.
All districts except Kanyakumari and Nilgiris
of Tamil Nadu cultivate Sugarcane.

**Uses**

Sugar cane is the raw material for extracting
white sugar. Sugarcane supports large number
of industries like sugar mills producing refined
sugars, distilleries producing liquor grade
ethanol and millions of jaggery manufacturing
units. Fresh sugarcane juice is a refreshing
drink. Molasses is the raw material for the
production of ethyl alcohol.

**Origin and Area of cultivation**

Palmyra is native to tropical regions of Africa,
Asia and New Guinea. Palmyra grows all over
Tamil Nadu, especially in coastal districts.

**Uses**

Exudate from inflorescence axis is collected for
preparing palm sugar. Inflorescence is tapped for its
sap which is used as health drink. Sap is processed
to get palm jaggery or fermented to give **toddy.**

Endosperm is used as a refreshing summer
food. Germinated seeds have an elongated embryo
surrounded by fleshy scale leaf which is edible.

#### <u>10.1.9 Oil Seeds 

Why fried foods are tastier than boiled foods?
There are two kinds of oils namely, essential
oils and vegetable oils or fatty oils. The
essential oils or volatile oils which possess
aroma evaporate or volatilize in contact
with air. Any organ of a plant may be the
source of essential oil. For example, flowers
of Jasmine, fruits of orange and roots of
ginger. The vegetable oils or non-volatile
oils or fixed oils that do not evaporate.
Whole seeds or endosperm form the sources
of vegetable oils.

Let us know about few oil seeds

**Groundnut / Peanut**
*Botanical name : Arachis hypogaea*
*Family : Fabaceae*

Origin and Area of
Cultivation: Groundnut is
native of Brazil. Portuguese
introduced groundnut into
Africa. The Spanish took
it to the South East Asia
and India via Philippines. In India Gujarat,
Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan are top
producers.

**Uses**

Nuts contain about 45% oil. The kernels
are also rich sources of phosphorous and
vitamins, particularly thiamine, riboflavin
and niacin. It is premium cooking oil because
it does not smoke. Lower grade oil is used in
manufacture of soaps and lubricants.

**Sesame / Gingelly**
*Botanical name : Sesamum indicum*
*Family : Pedaliaceae*

**Origin and Area of cultivation:**Sesamum
indicum has originated from Africa.. Sesame
is cultivated as a dry land crop. West Bengal
and Madhya Pradesh are the top producers
in India during 2017-18. It is considered as a
healthy oil in Southern Indian culture.

**Uses**

Sesame oil is used for mostly culinary purposes
in India. Lower grades are used in manufacture
of soaps, in paint industries, as a lubricant and as
an illuminant. In India, the oil is the basis of most
of the scented oils used in perfumes. Sesame seed
snacks are popular throughout India.
