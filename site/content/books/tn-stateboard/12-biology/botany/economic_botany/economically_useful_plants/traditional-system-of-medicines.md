India has a rich medicinal heritage. A number
of Traditional Systems of Medicine (TSM)
are practiced in India some of which come
from outside India. TSM in India can be
broadly classified into **institutionalized**
or documented and **non-institutionalized**
or oral traditions. Institutionalized Indian
systems include Siddha and Ayurveda which
are practiced for about two thousand years.
These systems have prescribed texts in which
the symptoms, disease diagnosis, drugs to cure,
preparation of drugs, dosage and diet regimes,
daily and seasonal regimens. Non- institutional
systems, whereas, do not have such records
and or practiced by rural and tribal peoples
across India. The knowledge is mostly held in
oral form. The TSM focus on healthy lifestyle
and healthy diet for maintaining good health
and disease reversal.

**Siddha system of medicine**

Siddha is the most popular, widely practiced
and culturally accepted system in Tamil
Nadu. It is based on the texts written by 18
Siddhars. There are different opinions on the
constitution of 18 Siddhars. The Siddhars are
not only from Tamil Nadu, but have also come
from other countries. The entire knowledge is
documented in the form of poems in Tamil.
Siddha is principally based on the **Pancabūta**
philosophy. According to this system three
humors namely **Vātam, Pittam and Kapam**
that are responsible for the health of human
beings and any disturbance in the equilibrium
of these humors result in ill health. The drug
sources of Siddha include plants, animal parts,
marine products and minerals. This system
specializes in using minerals for preparing
drugs with the long shelf-life. This system
uses about 800 herbs as source of drugs. Great
stress is laid on disease prevention, health
promotion, rejuvenation and cure.

**Ayurveda system of medicine**

Ayurveda supposed to have originated from
Brahma. The core knowledge is documented
by **Charaka, Sushruta and Vagbhata** in
compendiums written by them. This system
is also based on three humor principles
namely, Vatha, Pitha and Kapha which would
exist in equilibrium for a healthy living. This
system Uses more of herbs and few animal
parts as drug sources. Plant sources include
a good proportion of Himalayan plants. The
**Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia** of India lists
about 500 plants used as source of drugs.

**Folk system of medicine**

Folk systems survive as an oral tradition among
innumerable rural and tribal communities
of India. A consolidated study to document
the plants used by ethnic communities was
launched by the Ministry of Environment and
Forests, Government of India in the form of
All India Coordinated Research Project on
Ethnobiology. As a result about 8000 plant
species have been documented which are
used for medicinal purposes. The efforts to
document in several under-explored and
unexplored pockets of India still continue.
Major tribal communities in Tamil Nadu who
are known for their medicinal knowledge
include **Irulas, Malayalis, Kurumbas,**
**Paliyans and Kaanis.** Some of the important
medicinal plants are discussed below.
