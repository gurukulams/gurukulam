Interactions take place between the alleles of
the same gene i.e., alleles at the same locus is
called intragenic or intralocus gene interaction.

It includes the following:

(1) Incomplete dominance (2) Codominance(3) Multiple alleles (4) Pleiotropic genes are
common examples for intragenic interaction.

#### 2.4.1. Incomplete dominance – No blending of genes

**The German Botanist Carl Correns’s (1905) Experiment** - In 4 O’ clock plant, Mirabilis jalapa when the pure breeding homozygous
red (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>1</sup>) parent is crossed with homozygous
white (R<sup>2</sup>R<sup>2</sup>), the phenotype of the F<sub>1</sub> hybrid is
heterozygous pink (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>). The F<sub>1</sub> heterozygous
phenotype differs from both the parental
homozygous phenotype. This cross did not
exhibit the character of the dominant parent but
an intermediate colour pink. When one allele
is not completely dominant to another allele
it shows incomplete dominance. Such allelic
interaction is known as incomplete dominance.
F1 generation produces intermediate phenotype
pink coloured flower. When pink coloured
plants of F<sub>1</sub> generation were interbred in F<sub>2</sub> both
phenotypic and genotypic ratios were found to
be identical as 1 : 2 : 1(1 red : 2 pink : 1 white).
Genotypic ratio is 1 R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>1</sup> : 2 R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup> : 1 R<sup>2</sup>R<sup>2</sup>.From
this we conclude that the alleles themselves
remain discrete and unaltered proving the
Mendel’s Law of Segregation. The phenotypic and genotypic ratios are the same. There is no
blending of genes. In the F<sub>2</sub> generation R<sup>1</sup> and
R<sup>2</sup> genes segregate and recombine to produce
red, pink and white in the ratio of 1 : 2 : 1. R<sup>1</sup>
allele codes for an enzyme responsible for the
formation of red pigment. R<sup>2</sup> allele codes for
defective enzyme. R<sup>1</sup> and R<sup>12</sup> genotypes produce
only enough red pigments to make the flower
pink. Two R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>1</sup> are needed for pro/ducing red
flowers. Two R<sup>2</sup>R<sup>2</sup> genes are needed for white
flowers. If blending had taken place, the original
pure traits would not have appeared and all F<sub>2</sub>
plants would have pink flowers. It is very clear
that Mendel’s particulate inheritance takes
place in this cross which is confirmed by the
reappearance of original phenotype in F<sub>2</sub>

#### 2.4.2. Codominance (1 : 2 : 1) - This pattern occurs due to simultaneous (joint) expression of both alleles in the heterozygote - The phenomenon in which two

alleles are both expressed in the heterozygous
individual is known as codominance. Example:
Red and white flowers of *Camellia*, inheritance
of sickle cell haemoglobin, ABO blood group
system in humanbeings. In humanbeings, I<sup>A</sup> and

**How are we going to interpret the lack of dominance and give explanation to the intermediate heterozygote phenotype?**

**How will you explain incomplete dominance at the molecular level?**

Gene expression is explained in a quantitative
way. Wild-type allele which is a functional
allele when present in two copies (R<sup>1</sup> R<sup>1</sup>)
produces an functional enzyme which
synthesizes red pigments. The mutant allele
which is a defective allele in two copies (R<sup>2</sup> R<sup>2</sup>)
produces an enzyme which cannot synthesize
necessary red pigments. The white flower is
due to the mutation causing complete loss
of function. The F<sub>1</sub> intermediate phenotype
heterozygote (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>) has one copy of the allele
R<sup>1</sup>. R<sup>1</sup> produces 50% of the functional protein
resulting in half of the pigment of red flowered
plant and so it is pink. The intermediate
phenotype pink heterogyzote with 50% of
functional protein is not enough to create the
red phenotype homozygous, which makes
100% of the functional protein.

I<sup>B</sup> alleles of I gene are codominant which follows
Mendels law of segregation. The codominance
was demonstrated in plants with the help of
electrophoresis or chromatography for protein
or flavonoid substance. Example: Gossypium
hirsutum and Gossypium sturtianum, their F<sub>1</sub>
hybrid (amphiploid) was tested for seed proteins
by electrophoresis. Both the parents have
different banding patterns for their seed proteins.
In hybrids, additive banding pattern was noticed.
Their hybrid shows the presence of both the
types of proteins similar to their parents.
The heterozygote genotype gives rise to a
phenotype distinctly different from either of the
homozygous genotypes. The F<sub>1</sub> heterozygotes
produce a F<sub>2</sub> progeny in a phenotypic and
genotypic ratios of 1 : 2 : 1.

#### 2.4.3. Lethal genes

**An allele which has the potential to cause the death of an organism is called a “Lethal Allele”**. In 1907, E. Baur reported a lethal gene in
snapdragon (Antirrhinum sp.). It is an example
for recessive lethality. In snapdragon there are
three kinds of plants.

1.Green plants with chlorophyll. (CC)

2.Yellowish green plants with carotenoids are
referred to as pale green, golden or aurea
plants (Cc)

3.White plants without any chlorophyll. (cc)

The genotype of the homozygous green
plants is CC. The genotype of the homozygous
white plant is cc.

The aurea plants have the genotype Cc
because they are heterozygous of green and
white plants. When two such aurea plants
are crossed the F<sub>1</sub> progeny has identical
phenotypic and genotypic ratio of 1 : 2 : 1 (viz.
1 Green (CC) : 2 Aurea (Cc) : 1 White (cc))
Since the white plants lack chlorophyll
pigment, they will not survive. So the F<sub>2</sub>
ratio is modified into 1 : 2. In this case the
homozygous recessive genotype (cc) is lethal.

The term “lethal” is applied to those
changes in the genome of an organism which
produces effects severe enough to cause death.
Lethality is a condition in which the death of
certain genotype occurs prematurely. The fully
dominant or fully recessive lethal allele kills
the carrier individual only in its homozygous
condition. So the F<sub>2</sub> genotypic ratio will be 2 : 1
or 1 : 2 respectively.

#### 2.4.4. Pleiotropy – A single gene affects multiple traits

In Pleiotropy, the single gene affects multiple
traits and alter the phenotype of the organism.
The Pleiotropic gene influences a number of characters simultaneously and such genes
are called pleiotropic gene. were crossed with
a variety of peas having white flowers, light
coloured seeds and no spot on the axils of the
leaves, the three traits for flower colour, seed
colour and a leaf axil spot all were inherited
together as a single unit. Another example is:
sickle cell anemia.
