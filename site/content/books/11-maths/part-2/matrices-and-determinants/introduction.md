### Introduction

The beginnings of matrices and determinants go back to the second century BC although traces
can be seen back to the fourth century BC. However, it was not until near the end of the seventeenth
century that the ideas reappeared and development really got underway. It is not surprising that
the beginnings of matrices and determinants should arise through the study of systems of linear
equations. The Babylonians studied problems which lead to simultaneous linear equations and some
of these are preserved in clay tablets which survive till now.

The evolution of the theory of ‘matrices’ is the result of
attempts to obtain compact and simple methods for solving
systems of linear equations. It also began with the study of
transformations of geometric objects. In 1850, it was James
Joseph Sylvester an English Mathematician and lawyer,
coined the word ‘Matrix’ (originally from Latin: M a ter
means Mother - Collin’s Dictionary). Matrices are now
one of the most powerful tools in mathematics.

Generally, a matrix is nothing but a rectangular array
of objects. These matrices can be visualised in day-to-day
applications where we use matrices to represent a military parade or a school assembly or vegetation.

The term ‘determinant’ was first coined by Carl F Gauss in Disquisitiones arithmeticae
(1801) while studying quadratic forms. But the
concept is not the same as that of modern day
determinant. In the same work Gauss laid out the
coefficients of his quadratic forms in rectangular
arrays where he described matrix multiplication.

It was Cauchy (in 1812)
who used determinant in its
modern sense and studied it in
detail. He reproved the earlier results and gave new results of his own on minors
and adjoints. It was Arthur Cayley whose major contribution was in developing
the algebra of matrices and also published the theory of determinants in 1841.
In that paper he used two vertical lines on either side of the array to denote the
determinant, a notation which has now become standard. In 1858, he published
Memoir on the theory of matrices which was remarkable for containing the first abstract definition
of a matrix. He showed that the coefficient arrays studied earlier for quadratic forms and for linear
transformations were special cases of his general concept. They simplify our work to a great extent
when compared with other straight forward methods which would involve tedious computation.
The mathematicians James Joseph Sylvester (1814 – 1897), William Rowan Hamilton (1805 –
1865), and Arthur Cayley (1821 – 1895) played important roles in the development of matrix theory.
English mathematician Cullis was the first to use modern bracket notation for matrices in 1913.
The knowledge of matrices is absolutely necessary not only within the branches of mathematics but
also in other areas of science, genetics, economics, sociology, modern psychology and industrial
management.

Matrices are also useful for representing coefficients in systems of linear equations. Matrix
notations and operations are used in electronic spreadsheet programs on computers, which in turn are
used in different areas of business like budgeting, sales projection, cost estimation, and in science, for
analyzing the results of an experiment etc.

Interestingly, many geometric operations such as magnification, rotation and reflection through
a plane can also be represented mathematically by matrices. Economists use matrices for social
accounting, input-output tables and in the study of inter-industry economics. Matrices are also
used in communication theory and network analysis in electrical engineering. They are also used in
Cryptography.

In this chapter, we now first discuss matrices and their various properties. Then we continue to
study determinants, basic properties, minors and their cofactors. Here we now restrict the discussion
up to determinants of order 3 only.
