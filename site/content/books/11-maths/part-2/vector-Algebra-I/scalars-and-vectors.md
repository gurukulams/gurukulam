##### **Definition**
A scalar is a quantity that is determined by its magnitude.

For instance, distance, length, speed, temperature, voltage, mass, pressure, and work are scalars.

##### **Definition**
A vector is a quantity that is determined by both its magnitude and its direction and hence it is
a directed line segment.

For instance, force, displacement, and velocity (which gives the speed and direction of the
motion) are vectors.

We denote vectors by lower case letters with arrow. A two dimensional vector is a directed line
segment in \\( \reals{R^2}\\)
and a three dimensional vector is a directed line segment in \\( \reals {R^3}\\)
