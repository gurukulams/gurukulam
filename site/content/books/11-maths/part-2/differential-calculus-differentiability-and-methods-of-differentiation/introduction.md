In this chapter we discuss the concept of derivative and related concepts and develop tools
necessary for solving real life problems. In this connection, let us look at the following problem of
finding average velocity.

Almost everyone has an intuitive notion of speed or velocity as a rate at which a distance is
covered in a certain length of time. When, say, a bus travels 60 km in one hour, the average velocity
of the bus must have been 60 km/h. Of course, it is difficult to maintain this rate of 60 km/h for the
entire trip because the bus slows down for towns and speeds up when it passes cars. In other words,
the velocity changes with time. If a bus company’s schedule demands that the bus travel 60 km from
one town to another in one hour, the driver knows instinctively that he must compensate for velocities
or speeds greater than this at other points in the journey. Knowing that the average velocity is 60 km/h
does not, however, answer the question: What is the velocity of the bus at a particular instant?

In general, this average
velocity or average speed of a
moving object is the time rate
of change of position defined
by

\\(v_{ave}= \cfrac{distance travelled}{time of travel}\\)

Consider a runner who
finishes a 10 km race in an
elapsed time of 1 h 15 min
(1.25 h). The runner’s average
velocity or average speed for
this race is

\\(v_{ave}= \cfrac{10}{1.25}=8\\)
But suppose we now wish
to determine the runner’s exact
velocity v at the instant the runner is one-half into the race. If the distance run in the time interval
from 0 h to 0.5 h is measured to be 5 km, then \\(v_{ave}= \cfrac{5}{0.5}=10\\)

Again this number is not a measure or necessarily such a good indicator, of the instantaneous
rate v at which the runner is moving 0.5 h into the race. If we determine that rate at 0.6 h the runner
is 5.7 km from the starting line, then the average velocity from 0 h to 0.6 h is

\\(v_{ave}= \cfrac{10}{1.25}=8\\)

The latter number is a more realistic measure of the rate v. By “shrinking”
the time interval between 0.5 h and the time that corresponds to a measured
position close to 5 km, we expect to obtain even better approximations to the
runner’s velocity at time 0.5 h.

This problem of finding velocities leads us to deal with the general
problem of finding the derivative of a general mathematical model represented by the analytic
equation, y fx = ( ) Consequently, we will move towards in achieving the following objectives and
subsequently deal with the analysis of derivatives.

On completion of this chapter, the students are expected to
* acquire the concept of a derivative as limit of quotients.
* visualise the concept of derivative geometrically.
* understand derivative as a process of measuring changes.
* realise derivative as a tool to measure slopes of tangents to curves / rates of changes.
* understand different methods of differentiation.
* apply calculus as a tool to solve everyday real life problems.
