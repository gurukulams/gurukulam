Combinatorics is the branch of mathematics which is related to counting. It deals with arrangements
of objects as well as enumeration, that is, counting of objects with specific properties. The roots of the
subject can be traced as far back as 2800 BC(BCE) when it was used to study magic squares and
patterns within them.
English physicist and mathematician Sir Isaac Newton, most famous for his law of gravitation,
was instrumental in the scientific revolution of the 17th century. Newton’s belief in the “Persistance
of patterns” led to his first significant mathematical discovery, the generalization of the expansion of
binomial expressions.
Newton discovered Binomial Theorem which he claimed the easiest
way to solve the quadratures of curves. This discovery is essential
in understanding probability. The generalized version of the Binomial
Theorem, the Multinomial Theorem, applies to multiple variables. It is
widely used in Combinatorics and Statistics.

He was the first to use fractional indices and to employ coor-
dinate geometry to derive solutions to Diophantine equations. He

approximated partial sums of the harmonic series by logarithms (a
precursor to Euler’s summation formula) and was the first to use
power series with confidence and to revert power series. Newton’s
work on infinite series was inspired by Simon Stevin’s decimals. Newton (1643−1727)
In 1705, he was knighted by Queen Anne of England, making him Sir Isaac Newton. Newton made
discoveries in optics and theory of motions. Along with mathematician Leibnitz, Newton is credited
for developing essential theories of calculus.
Combinatorics has many real life applications where counting of objects are involved. For
example, we may be interested to know if there are enough mobile numbers to meet the demand
or the number of allowable passwords in a computer system. It also deals with counting techniques
and with optimisation methods, that is, methods related to finding the best possible solution among
several possibilities in a real problem. In this chapter we shall study counting problems in terms of
ordered or unordered arrangements of objects. These arrangements are referred to as permutations and
combinations. Combinatorics are largely used in the counting problems of Network communications,
Cryptography, Network Security and Probability theory. We shall explore their properties and apply
them to counting problems.
Consider another situation: We all know that our electricity consumer card number is of the form
A: B : C, where A denotes the electrical substation /larger capacity transformer number, B denotes the
smaller capacity electricity transformer number and C denotes the consumer number. There may be
conditions that to each substation certain maximal number of transformer can only be linked and with


Combinatorics and Mathematical Induction
a particular transformer certain maximal number of consumer connection can only be linked. Now
the question of deciding, whether a new Transformer/Substation needs to be erected, can be made by
the count of the number of consumer connections linked with a substation transformer. How to get
that count? This count can be easily arrived by the use of counting principles.
In this Chapter, the art of counting is discussed starting with the Fundamental principles of
counting, travelling through Permutation and Combinations.
