Francois viete(1540-1603) introduced the first systematic algebraic
notation and contributed to the theory of equations.Two French
mathematicians-philosophers *(Rene Descartes ´)* and *(Pierre de Fermat)*
independently founded analytical geometry in the-1630s by adapting
Francois viete’s algebra to the study of geometric loci. Descartes
established analytical geometry as“a way of visualizing algebraic
formulas” and developed the coordinate system as “a device to locate
points on a plane”. His main achievement was to bridge the gap between
algebra and geometry. With regard to algebra, he explained in detail that
how algebraic equations can be expressed and explained through the
use of geometrical shapes. Analytical geometry is a great invention of
Descartes and Fermat. Cartesian geometry, the alternative term used for
analytical geometry is named after him.

1596–1650 A.D

From the17th century onwards, mathematics is being developed in two directions: pure and applied
mathematics. One of the first areas of applied mathematic studied in the 17th century was the motion
of an object in a straight line. The straight line graphs can be used in the fields of study as diverse as
business, economics, social sciences, physics, and medicine. The problem of the shortest line plays a
chief and historically important role in the foundations of geometry.

Given a real-world problem, our first task is to formulate the problem using the language of
mathematics. Many techniques are used in the construction of mathematical models. Let us see
how linear equations (models) can be constructed from a given set of information and solved using
appropriate mathematical techniques. Consider some of the real-world, simple problems as illustrated
below:

**Real life situation 6.1:** When a student walks from his house, at an average speed of 6 kmph, reaches
his school by ten minutes before school starts. When his average speed is 4 kmph, he reaches his
school five minutes late. If he starts to walk to school every day at 8.00 A.M, then how to find 
(i) the
distance between house and the school 
(ii) the minimum average speed to reach the school on time
and time taken to reach the school 
(iii) the time at which the school starts 
(iv) the pair of straight lines
of his path of walk (Combined equation of two straight lines).

**Real life situation 6.2**
Suppose the Government has decided to erect a new Electrical Power Transmission Substation to provide better power supply to two villages namely *A* and *B*. The substation has Two Dimensional Analytical Geometry
to be on the line *l*. The distances of villages *A* and *B* from the foot of the perpendiculars *P* and *Q*
on the line l are *3* km and *5* km respectively and
the distance between *P* and *Q* is *6* km. How to
calculate the smallest length of cable required to
connect the two villages (or the roads that connect
the villages as well as the power station) from the
power station and to find the equations of the cable
lines (or roads) that connect the power station to
two villages.

**Real life situation 6.3:** Consider a hollow cylindrical vessel, with circumference 24 cm and height 10
cm. An ant is located on the outside of vessel 4 cm from the bottom. There is a
drop of honey at the diagrammatically opposite inside of the vessel, 3 cm from
the top. What is the shortest distance the ant would need to crawl to get the
honey? What is the equation of the path traced out by the ant. Here is a picture
that illustrates the position of the ant and the honey.

**Real life situation 6.4:** The quantity demanded of a certain type of Compact Disk is *22,000* units
when a unit price is *₹8*. The customer will not buy the disk, at a unit price of *₹30* or higher. On
the other side the manufacturer will not market any disk if the price is *₹6* or lower. However, if
the price is *₹14* the manufacturer can supply *24,000* units. Assume that the quantity demanded and
quantity supplied are linearly proportional to the price. 

(i) the Demand Equation

(ii) supply equation

(iii) the market equilibrium quantity and price

(iv) The quantity of demand and supply when the price is*₹10* .

The equation of the straight line for each of the problems stated above, not only solves the specific
case of solutions but also helps us get many information through it. Later, in this chapter, let us try
to solve these types of problems by using the concepts of straight lines. In order to understand the
straight line, we need to get acquainted with some of its basic concepts. Let us discuss those in detail

On completion of this chapter, the students expected to know
• the equation of a line in different forms
• whether two given lines are parallel or perpendicular;
• the distance of a given point from a given line and between two parallel lines,
• the family of straight lines for a given condition
• the equation of pair of straight lines, angle between them and angle bisectors
