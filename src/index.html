        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
                <h3>How it worked</h3>
                <p>People who has gone from here have made positive difference in their respective jobs. From a student to a candidate and then an employee, this transition involves four phases</p>
                <h4>Selection</h4>
                <p>The first challenge is to identify students who has potential. I take students strictly through references from</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex-Students</li>
                    <li>Friends and colleagues</li>
                    <li>College Professors</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once identified, The Student goes through interview process to get into the training. For my students, The entire training and stay is free. All he should carry is, his willingness to learn and passion to perform.</p>
                <h4>Student</h4>
                <p>
                    Students then stay with me for the entire duration of training.We watch movies to learn english. Solve puzzles to learn programing. Everyone gets their ids created in Github, Stack Overflow, Linkedin and sites like HackerRank.</p>
                <h4>Student to Candidate</h4>
                <p>
                    You don't learn swimming by reading user manual.To learn swimming one need to swim. Students work on real world problems from Open Source Project (Github), Problems given by my friends, or a Project from potential Hirer.Terminologies like Git, JIRA, Agile,
                    OOPS, Functional Programing, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript are not mere subjects it becomes part of their routine.</p>
                <h4>Candidate to Employee </h4>
                <p>
                    I reach out to companies to get their requirements.Candidates whom I feel match them will then be trained accordingly.Companies might want to execute part their work with the potential candidates and make a call accordingly.Thus team/individual is not
                    just trained but have prior exp of of the projects before the official commitment.</p>

    <!-- Our Success Section -->
    <section id="oursuccess" class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
                <h3>Our Success</h3>
                <p>Our journey has got three generations. When i started everything was depending on me. Later, We reched a level where my students can earn and build techatpak on their own. and now, At our third phase, We have reached a level where we can contribute to others</p>
                <h4>T(e)ach One</h4>
                <p>My students mentoring college students with their acadamic projects and placement preparation.</p>
                <h4>Opensource</h4>
                <p>
                    Apart from learning open source technonlogies, students are encouraged to contribute to open source projects. Infact we say to learn open source we should OPEN the SOURCE. After all that is the best way you will learn it</p>
                <h4>Extenal Community</h4>
                <p>
                    We voulnties to Technical meetups, Art festivals and organic forming related communities. </p>
                <h4>Organic forming</h4>
                <p>
                    Our team bulding activies are not like going to movies and parties(Ofcource we are not rich for these). We feel team building should be meaningful. We undertake unused lands and each student is suposed to spent considerable amount of everyday for forming at it. </p>

    <!-- Features Section -->
    <section id="features" class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
                <h3>Features</h3>
                <p>
                    TECH@PARK provides cost effective and risk free way to find technical talent who can deliver from day one of employment. Below are the unique features.
                </p>
                <h4>Selection Vs Collection</h4>
                <p>
                    Unlike traditional business models where It is just about the students ability to pay the fees which will get him into the training(Collection Model). At TECH@PARK, For a student, It is not collection but a selection process. It is about problem solving,
                    maths and programing.
                </p>
                <h4>Residential Training</h4>
                <p>
                    This is not a 9-5 training. Students stay with me for the entire duration of the course. I work closely with everyone to know their strength and weakness. Attention is given at the individual level based on their interest and talent level.
                </p>
                <h4>Zero Waiting Time</h4>
                <p>
                    Unlike campus/walk-in recruitment where you need to wait for the student to complete the course or serve notice period,Here, Candidates are immediate joinees who can directly deployed into real time projects.
                </p>
                <h4>Cost Effective</h4>
                <p>
                    There is no recruitment expense. Hirer don't pay candidates during the training period. they (may) pay/sponcer (only) the next student at the end of the training.
                </p>
                <h4>Risk Free</h4>
                <p>
                    Training program can be customized to your requirements. The process, tools and technology will be specific to your own projects.You choose candidates who has relevant training or experience with your problems. Upon need you can give part of your work
                    to the candidate and assess his performance before the offer.
                </p>
                <h4>Trained till perfection</h4>
                <p>
                    Not every student is the same so training should be for the time that they take to get completely trained. My students do not have predefined training period. There were cases where a student got placed within 2 week another took 6 months. I don't care whether
                    at the time of selection all are same. but when a student goes out he should be as good as any of my other students.

                <h3>About TECH@PARK</h3>
                <p>I am Sathish Kumar Thiyagarajan born in a family which has 3 generations of government school teachers. I used to wonder why should my father work in a remote village when his opportunity to earn is better if he works in city. He told
                    me this. Those who are privileged will shine anyway. But to make an underprivileged to comeup in his life is something that he wants to do.One was very clear. His success factor was not just about money. From there to what i am today.
                    TECH@PARK is the sum of experiences i had from those years. TECH@PARK was not done in boardrooms or marketing pitches. It was a result of two parallel stories that happened sometime around 2010.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had a friend who's brother Vijay Anand got placed in a MNC through campus program. But did not get his call for years. By the time he started to look for another opportunity he did not get interview calls citing his break in the CV. My friend asked
                    me to help him in job search. Vijayanand came and stayed with me in a small room which i shared with another passionate programer. All we did is just to train him during our free time until we/he find a job. It did not take much time
                    to realize that this guy has the talent to make it. But somehow the opportunity did not meet him
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile my college mate Hemananthan started a company and used to complain me that it is very difficult to find talented programmers. Being a startup it is very crucial to get right candidates but somehow the factors like a candidate comes from reputed
                    college, good CGPA does not guarantee his worth once put on job. he had the opportunity but unable to find the talent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you read the above it is very much evident that what would be the climax. Vijay Anand(THE TALENT) got introduced to Hemananthan(THE OPPORTUNITY). In the end all is well and ended well. But then !!
                </p>
                <p>
                    It did not stop there.From there on I got introduced to many like these two. Infact i was myself A Vijay Anand early in my career and then Hemananthan later, for the companies i was associated with. My friend helped me to get my first job. What my friend
                    did for me, i did for my students. There are people whose talent may not be visible, that just needs some lights thrown at it. Within my boundaries, i got deserved candidates (mostly by references), trained them, and got them placed
                    into companies. Positive feedback from the companies/students pushed me to quit my job to spent more time for this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today when i look back at the success factor, i have seen people whose talent was earlier unnoticed was then celebrated. I feel proud that most of my students are first generation engineer in their family. Something that my father will be proud about.
                    To summarize what TECH@PARK means to me is just about making sure that, THE OPPORTUNITY meets THE TALENT !
